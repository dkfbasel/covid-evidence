Person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 infection led to the isolation of patients that were subsequently administered a variety of treatments. Extensive measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 have been implemented to control the current outbreak. Special attention and efforts to protect or reduce transmission should be applied in susceptible populations including children, health care providers, and elderly people. In this review, we highlights the symptoms, epidemiology, transmission, pathogenesis, phylogenetic analysis and future directions to control the spread of this fatal disease.","Rothan, Hussin A | Byrareddy, Siddappa N",Rothan HA | Byrareddy SN,"Department of Biology, College of Arts and Sciences, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, USA.

This virus shares highly homological sequence with SARS-CoV, and causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with clinical symptoms similar to those reported for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The most characteristic symptom of patients with COVID-19 is respiratory distress, and most of the patients admitted to the intensive care could not breathe spontaneously. Additionally, some patients with COVID-19 also showed neurologic signs, such as headache, nausea, and vomiting. Increasing evidence shows that coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract and that they may also invade the central nervous system inducing neurological diseases. The infection of SARS-CoV has been reported in the brains from both patients and experimental animals, where the brainstem was heavily infected. Furthermore, some coronaviruses have been demonstrated able to spread via a synapse-connected route to the medullary cardiorespiratory center from the mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors in the lung and lower respiratory airways. In light of the high similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2, it is quite likely that the potential invasion of SARS-CoV2 is partially responsible for the acute respiratory failure of patients with COVID-19. Awareness of this will have important guiding significance for the prevention and treatment of the SARS-CoV-2-induced respiratory failure.","Li, Yan-Chao | Bai, Wan-Zhu | Hashikawa, Tsutomu",Li YC | Bai WZ | Hashikawa T,"Department of Histology and Embryology, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Norman Bethune College of Medicine, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China. | Institute of Acupuncture and Moxibustion, China Academy of Chinese Medical Science, Beijing, China. | Neural Architecture, Advanced Technology Development Group, RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Saitama, Japan.",eng,Journal Article | Review,20200227,United States,J Med Virol,Journal of medical virology,7705876,IM,NOTNLM,cell susceptibility | coronavirus | dissemination | nervous system,2020/02/28 06:00,2020/02/28 06:00,2020/02/28 06:00,2020/02/14 00:00 [received] | 2020/02/24 00:00 [accepted] | 2020/02/28 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/02/28 06:00 [medline] | 2020/02/28 06:00 [entrez],10.1002/jmv.25728 [doi],aheadofprint,J Med Virol. 2020 Feb 27. doi: 10.1002/jmv.25728.,"© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,ORCID: 0000-0002-2884-9829,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of our study was to determine the misdiagnosis rate of radiologists for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and evaluate the performance of chest CT in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19. The CT features of COVID-19 are reported and compared with the CT features of other viruses to familiarize radiologists with possible CT patterns. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This study included the first 51 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection confirmed by nucleic acid testing (23 women and 28 men; age range, 26-83 years) and two patients with adenovirus (one woman and one man; ages, 58 and 66 years). We reviewed the clinical information, CT images, and corresponding image reports of these 53 patients. The CT images included images from 99 chest CT examinations, including initial and follow-up CT studies. We compared the image reports of the initial CT study with the laboratory test results and identified CT patterns suggestive of viral infection. RESULTS. COVID-19 was misdiagnosed as a common infection at the initial CT study in two inpatients with underlying disease and COVID-19. Viral pneumonia was correctly diagnosed at the initial CT study in the remaining 49 patients with COVID-19 and two patients with adenovirus. These patients were isolated and obtained treatment. Ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidation with or without vascular enlargement, interlobular septal thickening, and air bronchogram sign are common CT features of COVID-19. The The ""reversed halo"" sign and pulmonary nodules with a halo sign are uncommon CT features. The CT findings of COVID-19 overlap with the CT findings of adenovirus infection. There are differences as well as similarities in the CT features of COVID-19 compared with those of the severe acute respiratory syndrome. CONCLUSION. We found that chest CT had a low rate of missed diagnosis of COVID-19 (3.9%, 2/51) and may be useful as a standard method for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 to optimize the management of patients. However, CT is still limited for identifying specific viruses and distinguishing between viruses.","Li, Yan | Xia, Liming",Li Y | Xia L,"Department of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1095 Jiefang Ave, Wuhan, Hubei 430030, China. | Department of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1095 Jiefang Ave, Wuhan, Hubei 430030, China.",eng,Journal Article,20200304,United States,AJR Am J Roentgenol,AJR.

METHODS: Utilizing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, USA) website, and a comprehensive review of PubMed literature, we obtained information regarding clinical signs and symptoms, treatment and diagnosis, transmission methods, protection methods and risk factors for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and COVID-19. Comparisons between the viruses were made. RESULTS: Inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation, and limited reporting on the virus within China has, in part, led to the rapid spread of COVID-19 throughout mainland China and into proximal and distant countries. Compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due in part to increased globalization and the focus of the epidemic. Wuhan, China is a large hub connecting the North, South, East and West of China via railways and a major international airport. The availability of connecting flights, the timing of the outbreak during the Chinese (Lunar) New Year, and the massive rail transit hub located in Wuhan has enabled the virus to perforate throughout China, and eventually, globally. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that we did not learn from the two prior epidemics of coronavirus and were ill-prepared to deal with the challenges the COVID-19 epidemic has posed. Future research should attempt to address the uses and implications of internet of things (IoT) technologies for mapping the spread of infection.","Peeri, Noah C | Shrestha, Nistha | Rahman, Md Siddikur | Zaki, Rafdzah | Tan, Zhengqi | Bibi, Saana | Baghbanzadeh, Mahdi | Aghamohammadi, Nasrin | Zhang, Wenyi | Haque, Ubydul",Peeri NC | Shrestha N | Rahman MS | Zaki R | Tan Z | Bibi S | Baghbanzadeh M | Aghamohammadi N | Zhang W | Haque U,"Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, TX, USA. | Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, TX, USA. | Department of Statistics, Begum Rokeya University, Rangpur, Bangladesh. | Centre for Epidemiology and Evidence-based Practice, Department of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. | Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, TX, USA. | Department of Biology, National University of Medical Sciences, Rawalpindi, Pakistan. | Department of Business Development, Ofogh Kourosh Chain Stores, Tehran, Iran. | Centre for Occupational and Environmental Health, Department of Social and Preventive Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. | Center for Disease Surveillance and Research, Center for Disease Control and Prevention of PLA, Beijing, People's Republic of China. | Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, TX, USA.",eng,Journal Article,20200222,England,Int J Epidemiol,International journal of epidemiology,7802871,IM,NOTNLM,COVID-19 | Coronavirus | MERS | SARS | epidemic | epidemiology | nCoV | outbreak,2020/02/23 06:00,2020/02/23 06:00,2020/02/23 06:00,2020/02/10 00:00 [received] | 2020/02/12 00:00 [accepted] | 2020/02/23 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/02/23 06:00 [medline],5748175 [pii] | 10.1093/ije/dyaa033 [doi],aheadofprint,Int J Epidemiol. 2020 Feb 22:dyaa033. doi: 10.1093/ije/dyaa033.,© The Author(s) 2020; all rights reserved.

We analyzed the data of 262 confirmed cases to determine the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Beijing. METHODS: We collected patients who were transferred by Beijing Emergency Medical Service to the designated hospitals. The information on demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory test for the COVID-19 virus, diagnostic classification, cluster case and outcome were obtained. Furthermore we compared the characteristics between severe and common confirmed cases which including mild cases, no-pneumonia cases and asymptomatic cases, and we also compared the features between COVID-19 and 2003 SARS. FINDINGS: By Feb 10, 2020, 262 patients were transferred from the hospitals across Beijing to the designated hospitals for special treatment of the COVID-19 infected by Beijing emergency medical service. Among of 262 patients, 46 (17.6%) were severe cases, 216 (82.4%) were common cases, which including 192 (73.3%) mild cases, 11(4.2%) non-pneumonia cases and 13 (5.0%) asymptomatic cases respectively. The median age of patients was 47.5 years old and 48.5% were male. 192 (73.3%) patients were residents of Beijing, 50 (26.0%) of which had been to Wuhan, 116 (60.4%) had close contact with confirmed cases, 21 (10.9%) had no contact history. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever (82.1%), cough (45.8%), fatigue (26.3%), dyspnea (6.9%) and headache (6.5%). The median incubation period was 6.7 days, the interval time from between illness onset and seeing a doctor was 4.5 days. As of Feb 10, 17.2% patients have discharged and 81.7% patients remain in hospital in our study, the fatality of COVID-19 infection in Beijing was 0.9%. INTERPRETATION: On the basis of this study, we provided the ratio of the COVID-19 infection on the severe cases to the mild, asymptomatic and non-pneumonia cases in Beijing. Population was generally susceptible, and with a relatively low fatality rate. The measures to prevent transmission was very successful at early stage, the next steps on the COVID-19 infection should be focused on early isolation of patients and quarantine for close contacts in families and communities in Beijing.

At present, there is no definite and effective treatment for COVID-19. ACE2 plays an important role in the RAS, and the imbalance between ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway and ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway in the RAS system will lead to multi-system inflammation. Increased ACE and Ang II are poor prognostic factors for severe pneumonia. Animal studies have shown that RAS inhibitors could effectively relieve symptoms of acute severe pneumonia and respiratory failure. The binding of COVID-19 and ACE2 resulted in the exhaustion of ACE2, and then ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway was inhibited. The balance of the RAS system was broken, and this would lead to the exacerbation of acute severe pneumonia. Therefore, we speculate that ACEI and AT1R inhibitors could be used in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia under the condition of controlling blood pressure, and might reduce the pulmonary inflammatory response and mortality.","Sun, M L | Yang, J M | Sun, Y P | Su, G H",Sun ML | Yang JM | Sun YP | Su GH,"Department of Oncology, Jinan Central Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan 250013, China. | The Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Remodeling and Function Research, Chinese Ministry of Education, Chinese Ministry of Health and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Department of Cardiology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China. | Department of Oncology, Jinan Central Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan 250013, China. | Department of Cardiology, Jinan Central Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan 250013, China.",chi,English Abstract | Journal Article,20200216,China,Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi,Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,8712226,IM,,,2020/02/16 06:00,2020/02/16 06:00,2020/02/16 06:00,2020/02/16 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/02/16 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/02/16 06:00 [medline],10.3760/cma.j.issn.1001-0939.2020.0014 [doi],aheadofprint,Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi. 2020 Feb 16;43(0):E014. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.1001-0939.2020.0014.,,"201907031/Jinan Science and Technology Development Plan/ | 81570324, 81970366/National Natural Science Foundation of China/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32150360,,Publisher,,,,,2020 Jan,"Features, Evaluation and Treatment Coronavirus (COVID-19).",,,"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), viral diseases continue to emerge and represent a serious issue to public health. In the last twenty years, several viral epidemics such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 to 2003, and H1N1 influenza in 2009, have been recorded. Most recently, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. In a timeline that reaches the present day, an epidemic of cases with unexplained low respiratory infections detected in Wuhan, the largest metropolitan area in China's Hubei province, was first reported to the WHO Country Office in China, on December 31, 2019. Published literature can trace the beginning of symptomatic individuals back to the beginning of December 2019. As they were unable to identify the causative agent, these first cases were classified as ""pneumonia of unknown etiology."" The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local CDCs organized an intensive outbreak investigation program. The etiology of this illness is now attributed to a novel virus belonging to the coronavirus (CoV) family, COVID-19. On February 11, 2020, the WHO Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, announced that the disease caused by this new CoV was a ""COVID-19,"" which is the acronym of ""coronavirus disease 2019"". In the past twenty years, two additional coronavirus epidemics have occurred. SARS-CoV provoked a large-scale epidemic beginning in China and involving two dozen countries with approximately 8000 cases and 800 deaths, and the MERS-CoV that began in Saudi Arabia and has approximately 2,500 cases and 800 deaths and still causes as sporadic cases. This new virus seems to be very contagious and has quickly spread globally. In a meeting on January 30, 2020, per the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005), the outbreak was declared by the WHO a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) as it had spread to 18 countries with four countries reporting human-to-human transmission. An additional landmark occurred on February 26, 2020, as the first case of the disease, not imported from China, was recorded in the United States.  Initially, the new virus was called 2019-nCoV. Subsequently, the task of experts of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) termed it the SARS-CoV-2 virus as it is very similar to the one that caused the SARS outbreak (SARS-CoVs). The CoVs have become the major pathogens of emerging respiratory disease outbreaks. They are a large family of single-stranded RNA viruses (+ssRNA) that can be isolated in different animal species. For reasons yet to be explained, these viruses can cross species barriers and can cause, in humans, illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS and SARS. Interestingly, these latter viruses have probably originated from bats and then moving into other mammalian hosts — the Himalayan palm civet for SARS-CoV, and the dromedary camel for MERS-CoV — before jumping to humans. The dynamics of SARS-Cov-2 are currently unknown, but there is speculation that it also has an animal origin. The potential for these viruses to grow to become a pandemic worldwide seems to be a serious public health risk. Concerning COVID-19, the WHO raised the threat to the CoV epidemic to the ""very high"" level, on February 28, 2020. Probably, the effects of the epidemic caused by the new CoV has yet to emerge as the situation is quickly evolving. World governments are at work to establish countermeasures to stem possible devastating effects. Health organizations coordinate information flows and issues directives and guidelines to best mitigate the impact of the threat. At the same time, scientists around the world work tirelessly, and information about the transmission mechanisms, the clinical spectrum of disease, new diagnostics, and prevention and therapeutic strategies are rapidly developing. Many uncertainties remain with regard to both the virus-host interaction and the evolution of the epidemic, with specific reference to the times when the epidemic will reach its peak. At the moment, the therapeutic strategies to deal with the infection are only supportive, and prevention aimed at reducing transmission in the community is our best weapon. Aggressive isolation measures in China have led to a progressive reduction of cases in the last few days. In Italy, in geographic regions of the north of the peninsula, political and health authorities are making incredible efforts to contain a shock wave that is severely testing the health system.  In the midst of the crisis, the authors have chosen to use the ""Statpearls"" platform because, within the PubMed scenario, it represents a unique tool that may allow them to make updates in real-time. The aim, therefore, is to collect information and scientific evidence and to provide an overview of the topic that will be continuously updated.","Cascella, Marco | Rajnik, Michael | Cuomo, Arturo | Dulebohn, Scott C | Di Napoli, Raffaela",Cascella M | Rajnik M | Cuomo A | Dulebohn SC | Di Napoli R,"Istituto Nazionale Tumori - IRCCS - Fondazione Pascale, Via Mariano Semmola 80100, Napoli.

In the absence of treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to find alternative methods to control the spread of disease. Here, we have conducted an online search for all treatment options related to coronavirus infections as well as some RNA-virus infection and we have found that general treatments, coronavirus-specific treatments, and antiviral treatments should be useful in fighting COVID-19. We suggest that the nutritional status of each infected patient should be evaluated before the administration of general treatments and the current children's RNA-virus vaccines including influenza vaccine should be immunized for uninfected people and health care workers. In addition, convalescent plasma should be given to COVID-19 patients if it is available. In conclusion, we suggest that all the potential interventions be implemented to control the emerging COVID-19 if the infection is uncontrollable.","Zhang, Lei | Liu, Yunhui",Zhang L | Liu Y,"Department of Neurosurgery, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China. | Department of Neurosurgery, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.",eng,"Journal Article | Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't | Review",20200303,United States,J Med Virol,Journal of medical virology,7705876,IM,NOTNLM,*2019-CoV | *COVID-19 | *MERS | *SARS | *coronavirus | *potential interventions,2020/02/14 06:00,2020/02/14 06:00,2020/02/14 06:00,2020/01/30 00:00 [received] | 2020/02/04 00:00 [accepted] | 2020/02/14 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/02/14 06:00 [medline] | 2020/02/14 06:00 [entrez],10.1002/jmv.25707 [doi],ppublish,J Med Virol. 2020 May;92(5):479-490. doi: 10.1002/jmv.25707.

However, the false-positive rate of positive results in the screening has not been reported up to now. But to clearify the false-positive rate during screening is important in COVID-19 control and prevention. Methods: Point values and reasonable ranges of the indicators which impact the false-positive rate of positive results were estimated based on the information available to us at present. The false-positive rate of positive results in the active screening was deduced, and univariate and multivariate-probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to understand the robustness of the findings. Results: When the infection rate of the close contacts and the sensitivity and specificity of reported results were taken as the point estimates, the positive predictive value of the active screening was only 19.67%, in contrast, the false-positive rate of positive results was 80.33%. The multivariate-probabilistic sensitivity analysis results supported the base-case findings, with a 75% probability for the false-positive rate of positive results over 47%. Conclusions: In the close contacts of COVID-19 patients, nearly half or even more of the 'asymptomatic infected individuals' reported in the active nucleic acid test screening might be false positives.","Zhuang, G H | Shen, M W | Zeng, L X | Mi, B B | Chen, F Y | Liu, W J | Pei, L L | Qi, X | Li, C",Zhuang GH | Shen MW | Zeng LX | Mi BB | Chen FY | Liu WJ | Pei LL | Qi X | Li C,"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an 710061, China.",chi,English Abstract | Journal Article,20200305,China,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,8208604,IM,NOTNLM,COVID-19 | Close contacts | False-positive | Nucleic acid test | Screening,2020/03/07 06:00,2020/03/07 06:00,2020/03/06 06:00,2020/03/06 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/07 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/07 06:00 [medline],10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200221-00144 [doi],aheadofprint,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi. 2020 Mar 5;41(4):485-488. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200221-00144.,,20200005YX005/Xi'an Special Science and Technology Projects on Prevention and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the spread of COVID-19, the routine clinical diagnosis and treatment for lung cancer patients has been disturbed. Due to the systemic immunosuppressive of lung cancer patients caused by the malignancy and anticancer treatments, lung cancer patients are more susceptible to infection than healthy individuals. Furthermore, patients with cancer had poorer prognosis from infection. Lung cancer patients should be the priority group for COVID-19 prevention. The protection provisions and control measures aiming to protect lung cancer patients from COVID-19 have been increasingly concerned. During the COVID-19 outbreak period, it should be carefully differentiated for fever and respiratory symptoms for lung cancer patients receiving anti-tumor treatment, in order to evaluate the risk of COVID-19. Moreover, it is necessary to carry out meticulous and individualized clinical management for lung cancer patients to effectively protect the patients from COVID-19.","Xu, Yan | Liu, Hongsheng | Hu, Ke | Wang, Mengzhao",Xu Y | Liu H | Hu K | Wang M,"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100730, China. | Department of Thoracic Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100730, China. | Department of Radiation Oncology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100730, China. | Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100730, China.",chi,Journal Article,,China,Zhongguo Fei Ai Za Zhi,Zhongguo fei ai za zhi = Chinese journal of lung cancer,101126433,IM,NOTNLM,*2019 novel coronavirus disease | *Lung neoplasms | *Patient management,2020/02/23 06:00,2020/03/17 06:00,2020/02/21 06:00,2020/02/21 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/17 06:00 [medline],10.3779/j.issn.1009-3419.2020.03.02 [doi],ppublish,Zhongguo Fei Ai Za Zhi. 2020 Feb 20;23. doi: 10.3779/j.issn.1009-3419.2020.03.02.,,,,20200316,,0 (COVID-19) | txid2697049 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2),,"*Betacoronavirus/pathogenicity | China | *Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology | *Disease Outbreaks | Disease Susceptibility | Humans | *Immunocompromised Host | *Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis/therapy | Patient Care Planning | *Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology | Risk",,,,,,,,,,,,

Therapeutics that may assist to contain its rapid spread and reduce its high mortality rates are urgently needed. Developing vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus may take many months. Moreover, vaccines based on viral-encoded peptides may not be effective against future coronavirus epidemics, as virus mutations could make them futile. Indeed, new Influenza virus strains emerge every year, requiring new immunizations. A tentative suggestion based on existing therapeutics, which would likely be resistant to new coronavirus mutations, is to use available angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) blockers, such as losartan, as therapeutics for reducing the aggressiveness and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 virus infections. This idea is based on observations that the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) very likely serves as the binding site for SARS-CoV-2, the strain implicated in the current COVID-19 epidemic, similarly to strain SARS-CoV implicated in the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic. This commentary elaborates on the idea of considering AT1R blockers as tentative treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infections, and proposes a research direction based on datamining of clinical patient records for assessing its feasibility.","Gurwitz, David",Gurwitz D,"Department of Human Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.",eng,Journal Article,20200304,United States,Drug Dev Res,Drug development research,8204468,IM,NOTNLM,AT1R blockers | COVID-19 epidemic | SARS-CoV-2 | angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) | losartan,2020/03/05 06:00,2020/03/05 06:00,2020/03/05 06:00,2020/02/25 00:00 [received] | 2020/02/27 00:00 [accepted] | 2020/03/05 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/05 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/05 06:00 [medline],10.1002/ddr.21656 [doi],aheadofprint,Drug Dev Res. 2020 Mar 4. doi: 10.1002/ddr.21656.,"© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,ORCID: 0000-0002-9363-1869,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified to be accountable for this disease. Human-to-human transmission is confirmed, and this disease (named COVID-19 by World Health Organization (WHO)) spread rapidly around the country and the world. As of 18 February 2020, the number of confirmed cases had reached 75,199 with 2009 fatalities. The COVID-19 resulted in a much lower case-fatality rate (about 2.67%) among the confirmed cases, compared with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Among the symptom composition of the 45 fatality cases collected from the released official reports, the top four are fever, cough, short of breath, and chest tightness/pain. The major comorbidities of the fatality cases include hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, cerebral infarction, and chronic bronchitis. The source of the virus and the pathogenesis of this disease are still unconfirmed. No specific therapeutic drug has been found. The Chinese Government has initiated a level-1 public health response to prevent the spread of the disease.

The virus originated in bats and was transmitted to humans through yet unknown intermediary animals in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in December 2019. There have been around 96,000 reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and 3300 reported deaths to date (05/03/2020). The disease is transmitted by inhalation or contact with infected droplets and the incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 d. The symptoms are usually fever, cough, sore throat, breathlessness, fatigue, malaise among others. The disease is mild in most people; in some (usually the elderly and those with comorbidities), it may progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi organ dysfunction. Many people are asymptomatic. The case fatality rate is estimated to range from 2 to 3%. Diagnosis is by demonstration of the virus in respiratory secretions by special molecular tests. Common laboratory findings include normal/ low white cell counts with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). The computerized tomographic chest scan is usually abnormal even in those with no symptoms or mild disease. Treatment is essentially supportive; role of antiviral agents is yet to be established. Prevention entails home isolation of suspected cases and those with mild illnesses and strict infection control measures at hospitals that include contact and droplet precautions. The virus spreads faster than its two ancestors the SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), but has lower fatality. The global impact of this new epidemic is yet uncertain.","Singhal, Tanu",Singhal T,"Department of Pediatrics and Infectious Disease, Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital and Medical Research Institute, Mumbai, India. tanusinghal@yahoo.com.",eng,Journal Article | Review,20200313,India,Indian J Pediatr,Indian journal of pediatrics,0417442,IM,NOTNLM,2019-nCOV | COVID-19 | Pneumonia | Review | SARS-CoV-2,2020/03/14 06:00,2020/03/14 06:00,2020/03/14 06:00,2020/02/23 00:00 [received] | 2020/02/25 00:00 [accepted] | 2020/03/14 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/14 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/14 06:00 [medline],10.1007/s12098-020-03263-6 [pii] | 10.1007/s12098-020-03263-6 [doi],aheadofprint,Indian J Pediatr. 2020 Mar 13. doi: 10.1007/s12098-020-03263-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: A retrospective comparison of the pregnancy outcomes was done between 16 women with COVID-19 and 45 women without COVID-19. Also, the results of laboratory tests, imaging examinations, and the 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test were performed in 10 cases of neonatal deliverd from women with COVID-19. Results: (1) Of the 16 pregnant women with COVID-19, 15 cases were ordinary type and 1 case was severe type. No one has progressed to critical pneumonia. The delivery method of the two groups was cesarean section, and the gestational age were (38.7±1.4) and (37.9±1.6) weeks, there was no significant difference between the two groups (P> 0.05). Also, there wee no significant differences in the intraoperative blood loss and birth weight of the newborn between the two groups (all P>0.05). (2) Ten cases of neonates delivered from pregnant women with COVID-19 were collected. The 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test were all negative. There were no significant differences in fetal distress, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, preterm birth, and neonatal asphyxia between the two groups (all P>0.05). (3) In the treatment of uterine contraction fatigue, carbetocin or carboprost tromethamine was used more in cesarean section for pregnant women with COVID-19 (1.3±0.6), compared with Non-COVID-19 group (0.5±0.7), the difference was statistically significant (P=0.001). Conclusions: If there is an indication for obstetric surgery or critical illness of COVID-19 in pregnant women, timely termination of pregnancy will not increase the risk of premature birth and asphyxia of the newborn, but it is beneficial to the treatment and rehabilitation of maternal pneumonia. Preventive use of long-acting uterotonic agents could reduce the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage during surgery. 2019-nCoV infection has not been found in neonates deliverd from pregnant women with COVID-19.","Zhang, L | Jiang, Y | Wei, M | Cheng, B H | Zhou, X C | Li, J | Tian, J H | Dong, L | Hu, R H",Zhang L | Jiang Y | Wei M | Cheng BH | Zhou XC | Li J | Tian JH | Dong L | Hu RH,"Department of Obstetrics, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan 430060, China. | Department of Obstetrics, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan 430060, China. | Department of Obstetrics, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan 430060, China. | Department of Obstetrics, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan 430060, China. | Department of Neonatology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan 430060, China. | Department of Obstetrics, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan 430060, China. | Department of Obstetrics, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan 430060, China. | Department of Obstetrics, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan 430060, China. | Department of Obstetrics, The Central Hospital of Qianjiang City, Qianjiang 433199, China.",chi,English Abstract | Journal Article,20200307,China,Zhonghua Fu Chan Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua fu chan ke za zhi,16210370R,IM,NOTNLM,2019-nCoV | COVID-19 | Neonates | Pneumonia | Pregnancy outcomes,2020/03/09 06:00,2020/03/09 06:00,2020/03/09 06:00,2020/03/09 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/09 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/09 06:00 [medline],10.3760/cma.j.cn112141-20200218-00111 [doi],aheadofprint,Zhonghua Fu Chan Ke Za Zhi. 2020 Mar 7;55(0):E009. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112141-20200218-00111.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Demographic and clinical data of all confirmed cases with COVID-19 on admission at Tongji Hospital from January 10 to February 12, 2020, were collected and analyzed. The data of laboratory examinations, including peripheral lymphocyte subsets, were analyzed and compared between severe and non-severe patients. RESULTS: Of the 452 patients with COVID-19 recruited, 286 were diagnosed as severe infection. The median age was 58 years and 235 were male. The most common symptoms were fever, shortness of breath, expectoration, fatigue, dry cough and myalgia. Severe cases tend to have lower lymphocytes counts, higher leukocytes counts and neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio (NLR), as well as lower percentages of monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. Most of severe cases demonstrated elevated levels of infection-related biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines. The number of T cells significantly decreased, and more hampered in severe cases. Both helper T cells and suppressor T cells in patients with COVID-19 were below normal levels, and lower level of helper T cells in severe group. The percentage of naïve helper T cells increased and memory helper T cells decreased in severe cases. Patients with COVID-19 also have lower level of regulatory T cells, and more obviously damaged in severe cases. CONCLUSIONS: The novel coronavirus might mainly act on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes. Surveillance of NLR and lymphocyte subsets is helpful in the early screening of critical illness, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.","Qin, Chuan | Zhou, Luoqi | Hu, Ziwei | Zhang, Shuoqi | Yang, Sheng | Tao, Yu | Xie, Cuihong | Ma, Ke | Shang, Ke | Wang, Wei | Tian, Dai-Shi",Qin C | Zhou L | Hu Z | Zhang S | Yang S | Tao Y | Xie C | Ma K | Shang K | Wang W | Tian DS,"Department of Neurology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. | Department of Neurology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. | Department of Neurology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. | Department of Neurology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. | Department of Neurology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. | Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. | Department of Emergency Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. | Department of Infectious Diseases, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. | Department of Neurology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. | Department of Neurology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. | Department of Neurology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.",eng,Journal Article,20200312,United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,IM,NOTNLM,COVID-19 | Lymphocyte subsets | T lymphocyte | immune response,2020/03/13 06:00,2020/03/13 06:00,2020/03/13 06:00,2020/02/20 00:00 [received] | 2020/03/13 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/13 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/13 06:00 [medline],5803306 [pii] | 10.1093/cid/ciaa248 [doi],aheadofprint,Clin Infect Dis. 2020 Mar 12:ciaa248. doi: 10.1093/cid/ciaa248.,"© The Author(s) 2020.

As of this time, there is no known effective pharmaceutical treatment, although it is much needed for patient contracting the severe form of the disease. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the evidence regarding chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, and three trial Registries were searched for studies on the use of chloroquine in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: We included six articles (one narrative letter, one in-vitro study, one editorial, expert consensus paper, two national guideline documents) and 23 ongoing clinical trials in China. Chloroquine seems to be effective in limiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2 (virus causing COVID-19) in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: There is rationale, pre-clinical evidence of effectiveness and evidence of safety from long-time clinical use for other indications to justify clinical research on chloroquine in patients with COVID-19. However, clinical use should either adhere to the Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered Interventions (MEURI) framework or be ethically approved as a trial as stated by the World Health Organization. Safety data and data from high-quality clinical trials are urgently needed.","Cortegiani, Andrea | Ingoglia, Giulia | Ippolito, Mariachiara | Giarratano, Antonino | Einav, Sharon",Cortegiani A | Ingoglia G | Ippolito M | Giarratano A | Einav S,"Department of Surgical, Oncological and Oral Science (Di.Chir.On.S.), Section of Anaesthesia, Analgesia, Intensive Care and Emergency, Policlinico Paolo Giaccone, University of Palermo, Italy.

The increasing number of cases of confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China is striking. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relation between chest CT findings and the clinical conditions of COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Data on 101 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia were retrospectively collected from four institutions in Hunan, China. Basic clinical characteristics and detailed imaging features were evaluated and compared between two groups on the basis of clinical status: nonemergency (mild or common disease) and emergency (severe or fatal disease). RESULTS. Patients 21-50 years old accounted for most (70.2%) of the cohort, and five (5.0%) patients had disease associated with a family outbreak. Most patients (78.2%) had fever as the onset symptom. Most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had typical imaging features, such as ground-glass opacities (GGO) (87 [86.1%]) or mixed GGO and consolidation (65 [64.4%]), vascular enlargement in the lesion (72 [71.3%]), and traction bronchiectasis (53 [52.5%]). Lesions present on CT images were more likely to have a peripheral distribution (88 [87.1%]) and bilateral involvement (83 [82.2%]) and be lower lung predominant (55 [54.5%]) and multifocal (55 [54.5%]). Patients in the emergency group were older than those in the non-emergency group. Architectural distortion, traction bronchiectasis, and CT involvement score aided in evaluation of the severity and extent of the disease. CONCLUSION. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia have typical imaging features that can be helpful in early screening of highly suspected cases and in evaluation of the severity and extent of disease. Most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia have GGO or mixed GGO and consolidation and vascular enlargement in the lesion. Lesions are more likely to have peripheral distribution and bilateral involvement and be lower lung predominant and multifocal. CT involvement score can help in evaluation of the severity and extent of the disease.","Zhao, Wei | Zhong, Zheng | Xie, Xingzhi | Yu, Qizhi | Liu, Jun",Zhao W | Zhong Z | Xie X | Yu Q | Liu J,"Department of Radiology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, No. 139 Middle Remin Rd, Changsha, Hunan, 410011, P.R.

METHODS: We extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female. The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died. Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife. Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city. The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%). Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%). The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%). No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease. Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission. CONCLUSIONS: During the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness.

The infection may result into severe pneumonia with clusters illness onsets. Its impacts on public health make it paramount to clarify the clinical features with other pneumonias. METHODS: Nineteen 2019-nCoV pneumonia (NCOVID-19) and fifteen other pneumonia patients (NON-NCOVID-19) in out of Hubei places were involved in this study. Both NCOVID-19 and NON-NCOVID-19 patients were confirmed to be infected in throat swabs or/and sputa with or without 2019-nCoV by real-time RT-PCR. We analyzed the demographic, epidemiological, clinical, and radiological features from those patients, and compared the difference between NCOVID-19 and NON-NCOVID-19. RESULTS: All patients had a history of exposure to confirmed case of 2019-nCoV or travel to Hubei before illness. The median duration, respectively, was 8 (IQR:6~11) and 5 (IQR:4~11) days from exposure to onset in NCOVID-19 and NON-NCOVID-19. The clinical symptoms were similar between NCOVID-19 and NON-NCOVID-19. The most common symptoms were fever and cough. Fifteen (78.95%) NCOVID-19 but 4 (26.67%) NON-NCOVID-19 patients had bilateral involvement while 17 (89.47%) NCOVID-19 but 1 (6.67%) NON-NCOVID-19 patients had multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity of chest CT images. Compared to NON-NCOVID-19, NCOVID-19 present remarkably more abnormal laboratory tests including AST, ALT, γ-GT, LDH and α-HBDH. CONCLUSION: The 2019-nCoV infection caused similar onsets to other pneumonias. CT scan may be a reliable test for screening NCOVID-19 cases. Liver function damage is more frequent in NCOVID-19 than NON-NCOVID-19 patients. LDH and α-HBDH may be considerable markers for evaluation of NCOVID-19.","Zhao, Dahai | Yao, Feifei | Wang, Lijie | Zheng, Ling | Gao, Yongjun | Ye, Jun | Guo, Feng | Zhao, Hui | Gao, Rongbao",Zhao D | Yao F | Wang L | Zheng L | Gao Y | Ye J | Guo F | Zhao H | Gao R,"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, the Second Affiliated Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui Province, China. | Department of Respiratory Medicine, Suzhou Municipal Hospital, Suzhou, Anhui, China. | State Key Laboratory of Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, National Center for AIDS/STD Control and Prevention, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China. | Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, the Second Affiliated Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui Province, China. | National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Key Laboratory for Medical Virology, National Health and Family Planning Commission, Beijing, China. | Infectious disease department, the Second Affiliated Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui Province, China. | Department of Respiratory Medicine, Suzhou Municipal Hospital, Suzhou, Anhui, China. | Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, the Second Affiliated Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui Province, China. | National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Key Laboratory for Medical Virology, National Health and Family Planning Commission, Beijing, China.",eng,Journal Article,20200312,United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,IM,NOTNLM,Clinical features | Infectious diseases | Novel coronavirus pneumonia | Respiratory infection,2020/03/13 06:00,2020/03/13 06:00,2020/03/13 06:00,2020/02/14 00:00 [received] | 2020/03/13 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/13 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/13 06:00 [medline],5803302 [pii] | 10.1093/cid/ciaa247 [doi],aheadofprint,Clin Infect Dis. 2020 Mar 12:ciaa247. doi: 10.1093/cid/ciaa247.,"© The Author(s) 2020.

As the National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine is the primary medical care center for COVID-19 inZhejiang Province. Based on the present expert consensus carried out by National Health Commission and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, our team summarized and established an effective treatment strategy centered on ""Four-Anti and Two-Balance"" for clinical practice. The ""Four-Anti and Two-Balance""strategy included antivirus, anti-shock, anti-hyoxemia, anti-secondary infection, and maintaining of water, electrolyte and acid base balance and microecological balance. Meanwhile, integrated multidisciplinarypersonalized treatment was recommended to improve therapeutic effect. The importance of early viralogical detection, dynamic monitoring of inflammatory indexes and chest radiograph was emphasized in clinical decision-making. Sputum was observed with the highest positive rate of RT-PCR results. Viral nucleic acids could be detected in10% patients'blood samples at acute periodand 50% of patients had positive RT-PCR results in their feces. We also isolated alive viral strains from feces, indicating potential infectiousness of feces.Dynamic cytokine detection was necessary to timely identifyingcytokine storms and application of artificial liver blood purification system. The ""Four-Anti and Two-Balance""strategyeffectively increased cure rate and reduced mortality. Early antiviral treatment could alleviate disease severity and prevent illness progression, and we found lopinavir/ritonavir combined with abidol showed antiviraleffects in COVID-19. Shock and hypoxemia were usually caused by cytokine storms. The artificial liver blood purification system could rapidly remove inflammatory mediators and block cytokine storm.Moreover, it also favoredthe balance of fluid, electrolyte and acid-base and thus improved treatment efficacy in critical illness. For cases of severe illness, early and also short periods of moderate glucocorticoid was supported. Patients with oxygenation index below 200 mmHg should be transferred to intensive medical center. Conservative oxygen therapy was preferred and noninvasive ventilation was not recommended. Patients with mechanical ventilation should be strictly supervised with cluster ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention strategies. Antimicrobial prophylaxis should be prescribed rationally and was not recommended except for patients with long course of disease, repeated fever and elevated procalcitonin (PCT), meanwhile secondary fungal infection should be concerned.Some patients with COVID-19 showed intestinal microbialdysbiosis with decreasedprobiotics such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. Nutritional and gastrointestinal function should be assessed for all patients.Nutritional support and application of prebiotics or probiotics were suggested to regulate the balance of intestinal microbiota and reduce the risk of secondary infection due to bacterial translocation. Anxiety and fear were common in patients with COVID-19. Therefore, we established dynamic assessment and warning for psychological crisis. We also integrated Chinese medicine in treatment to promote disease rehabilitation through classification methods of traditional Chinese medicine. We optimized nursing process for severe patients to promote their rehabilitation. It remained unclear about viral clearance pattern after the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, two weeks' quarantine for discharged patients was required and a regular following up was also needed.The Zhejiang experience above and suggestions have been implemented in our center and achieved good results. However, since COVID-19 was a newly emerging disease, more work was warranted to improve strategies of prevention, diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19.","Tárnok, Attila | Xu, Kaijin | Cai, Hongliu | Shen, Yihong | Ni, Qin | Chen, Yu | Hu, Shaohua | Li, Jianping | Wang, Huafen | Yu, Liang | Huang, He | Qiu, Yunqing | Wei, Guoqing | Fang, Qiang | Zhou, Jianying | Sheng, Jifang | Liang, Tingbo | Li, Lanjuan",Tárnok A | Xu K | Cai H | Shen Y | Ni Q | Chen Y | Hu S | Li J | Wang H | Yu L | Huang H | Qiu Y | Wei G | Fang Q | Zhou J | Sheng J | Liang T | Li L,"Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology (IMISE), University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany. | Dept.

METHODS: Fifty-two cases of COVID-19 were admitted in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine. The consecutive chest CT scans were followed up for all patients with an average of 4 scans performed per patient during the hospitalization. The shortest interval between each scan was 2 days and the longest was 7 days. The shape, number and distribution of lung shadows, as well as the characteristics of the lesions on the CT images were reviewed. RESULTS: The obvious shadows infiltrating the lungs were shown on CT images in 50 cases, for other 2 cases there was no abnormal changes in the lungs during the first CT examination. Ground-glass opacities (GGO) were found in 48 cases (92.3%), and 19 cases (36.5%) had patchy consolidation and sub-consolidation, which were accompanied with air bronchi sign in 17 cases (32.7%). Forty one cases (78.8%) showed a thickened leaflet interval, 4 cases (7.6%) had a small number of fibrous stripes. During hospitalization, GGO lesions in COVID-19 patients gradually became rare, the fibrous strip shadows increased and it became the most common imaging manifestation. The lesions rapidly progressed in 39 cases (75.0%) within 6-9 days after admission. On days 10-14 of admission, the lesions distinctly resolved in 40 cases (76.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The chest CT images of patients with COVID-19 have certain characteristics with dynamic changes, which are of value for monitoring disease progress and clinical treatment.","Wang, Jincheng | Liu, Jinpeng | Wang, Yuanyuan | Liu, Wei | Chen, Xiaoqun | Sun, Chao | Shen, Xiaoyong | Wang, Qidong | Wu, Yaping | Liang, Wenjie | Ruan, Lingxiang",Wang J | Liu J | Wang Y | Liu W | Chen X | Sun C | Shen X | Wang Q | Wu Y | Liang W | Ruan L,"Radiology Department, the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China. | Radiology Department, the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China. | Radiology Department, the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China. | Radiology Department, the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China. | Radiology Department, the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China. | Radiology Department, the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China. | Radiology Department, the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China. | Radiology Department, the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China. | Radiology Department, the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China. | Radiology Department, the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China. | Radiology Department, the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China.",chi,Journal Article,,China,Zhejiang Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

Common presentations of confirmed cases include fever, fatigue, dry cough, upper airway congestion, sputum production, shortness of breath, myalgia/arthralgia with lymphopenia, prolonged prothrombin time, elevated C-reactive protein, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. The reported severe/critical case ratio is approximately 7-10% and median time to intensive care admission is 9.5-10.5 days with mortality of around 1-2% varied geographically. Similar to outbreaks of other newly identified virus, there is no proven regimen from conventional medicine and most reports managed the patients with lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, beta-interferon, glucocorticoid and supportive treatment with remdesivir undergoing clinical trial. In China, Chinese medicine is proposed as a treatment option by national and provincial guidelines with substantial utilization. We reviewed the latest national and provincial clinical guidelines, retrospective cohort studies, and case series regarding the treatment of COVID-19 by add-on Chinese medicine. We have also reviewed the clinical evidence generated from SARS and H1N1 management with hypothesized mechanisms and latest in silico findings to identify candidate Chinese medicines for the consideration of possible trials and management. Given the paucity of strongly evidence-based regimens, the available data suggest that Chinese medicine could be considered as an adjunctive therapeutic option in the management of COVID-19.","Chan, Kam Wa | Wong, Vivian Taam | Tang, Sydney Chi Wai",Chan KW | Wong VT | Tang SCW,"Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong. | School of Chinese Medicine The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong. | Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.",eng,Journal Article,20200313,Singapore,Am J Chin Med,The American journal of Chinese medicine,7901431,IM,NOTNLM,2019-nCoV | COVID-19 | Chinese Medicine | Guideline | Integrative Medicine | Review,2020/03/14 06:00,2020/03/14 06:00,2020/03/14 06:00,2020/03/14 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/14 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/14 06:00 [medline],10.1142/S0192415X20500378 [doi],aheadofprint,Am J Chin Med. 2020 Mar 13:1-26. doi: 10.1142/S0192415X20500378.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A Review of Historical Classics, Research Evidence and Current Prevention Programs.",,10.1007/s11655-020-3192-6 [doi],"OBJECTIVE: Since December 2019, an outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, and rapidly spread to almost all parts of China. This was followed by prevention programs recommending Chinese medicine (CM) for the prevention. In order to provide evidence for CM recommendations, we reviewed ancient classics and human studies. METHODS: Historical records on prevention and treatment of infections in CM classics, clinical evidence of CM on the prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 influenza, and CM prevention programs issued by health authorities in China since the COVID-19 outbreak were retrieved from different databases and websites till 12 February, 2020. Research evidence included data from clinical trials, cohort or other population studies using CM for preventing contagious respiratory virus diseases. RESULTS: The use of CM to prevent epidemics of infectious diseases was traced back to ancient Chinese practice cited in Huangdi's Internal Classic (Huang Di Nei Jing) where preventive effects were recorded. There were 3 studies using CM for prevention of SARS and 4 studies for H1N1 influenza. None of the participants who took CM contracted SARS in the 3 studies. The infection rate of H1N1 influenza in the CM group was significantly lower than the non-CM group (relative risk 0.36, 95% confidence interval 0.24-0.52; n=4). For prevention of COVID-19, 23 provinces in China issued CM programs. The main principles of CM use were to tonify qi to protect from external pathogens, disperse wind and discharge heat, and resolve dampness. The most frequently used herbs included Radix astragali (Huangqi), Radix glycyrrhizae (Gancao), Radix saposhnikoviae (Fangfeng), Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae (Baizhu), Lonicerae Japonicae Flos (Jinyinhua), and Fructus forsythia (Lianqiao). CONCLUSIONS: Based on historical records and human evidence of SARS and H1N1 influenza prevention, Chinese herbal formula could be an alternative approach for prevention of COVID-19 in high-risk population. Prospective, rigorous population studies are warranted to confirm the potential preventive effect of CM.","Luo, Hui | Tang, Qiao-Ling | Shang, Ya-Xi | Liang, Shi-Bing | Yang, Ming | Robinson, Nicola | Liu, Jian-Ping",Luo H | Tang QL | Shang YX | Liang SB | Yang M | Robinson N | Liu JP,"Institute for Tibetan Medicine, China Tibetology Research Center, Beijing, 100101, China. | Centre for Evidence-Based Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, 100029, China. | School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, 100029, China. | Centre for Evidence-Based Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, 100029, China. | School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, 100029, China. | Centre for Evidence-Based Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, 100029, China. | School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, 100029, China. | Centre for Evidence-Based Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, 100029, China. | School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, 100029, China. | Centre for Evidence-Based Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, 100029, China. | School of Health and Social Care, London South Bank University, London, SE1 0AA, UK. | Centre for Evidence-Based Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, 100029, China. jianping_l@hotmail.com. | Institute of Integrated Traditional Chinese Medicine and Western Medicine, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510120, China. jianping_l@hotmail.com.",eng,Journal Article,20200217,China,Chin J Integr Med,Chinese journal of integrative medicine,101181180,IM,NOTNLM,Chinese medicine | clinical evidence | corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) | prevention program | review,2020/02/18 06:00,2020/02/18 06:00,2020/02/18 06:00,2020/02/13 00:00 [accepted] | 2020/02/18 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/02/18 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/02/18 06:00 [medline],10.1007/s11655-020-3192-6 [pii] | 10.1007/s11655-020-3192-6 [doi],aheadofprint,Chin J Integr Med. 2020 Feb 17. doi: 10.1007/s11655-020-3192-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By simulation and data fitting, the model showed the peak existing confirmed cases of 59 769 arriving on 15 February 2020, with the coefficient of determination close to 1 and the fitting bias 3.02%, suggesting high precision of the data-fitting results. More rigorous government control policies were associated with a slower increase in the infected population. Isolation and protective procedures would be less effective as more cases accrue, so the optimization of the treatment plan and the development of specific drugs would be of more importance. There was an upward trend of R in the beginning, followed by a downward trend, a temporary rebound, and another continuous decline. The feature of high infectiousness for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) led to an upward trend, and government measures contributed to the temporary rebound and declines. The declines of R could be exploited as strong evidence for the effectiveness of the interventions. Evidence from the four-phase stringent measures showed that it was significant to ensure early detection, early isolation, early treatment, adequate medical supplies, patients' being admitted to designated hospitals, and comprehensive therapeutic strategy. Collaborative efforts are required to combat the novel coronavirus, focusing on both persistent strict domestic interventions and vigilance against exogenous imported cases.","Fang, Yaqing | Nie, Yiting | Penny, Marshare",Fang Y | Nie Y | Penny M,"School of Public Health, Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, China. | Graduate School, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China. | Department of Public Health Sciences, California Baptist University, Riverside, California.",eng,Journal Article,20200306,United States,J Med Virol,Journal of medical virology,7705876,IM,NOTNLM,COVID-19 | SARS-CoV-2 | SEIR | basic reproductive number | data fitting | data simulation | effective reproductive number | effectiveness | intervention | sensitivity analysis | transmission,2020/03/07 06:00,2020/03/07 06:00,2020/03/07 06:00,2020/02/25 00:00 [received] | 2020/03/04 00:00 [accepted] | 2020/03/07 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/07 06:00 [medline] | 2020/03/07 06:00 [entrez],10.1002/jmv.25750 [doi],aheadofprint,J Med Virol. 2020 Mar 6. doi: 10.1002/jmv.25750.,"© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,ORCID: 0000-0002-9963-4462,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recorded findings at any chest CT performed in the included children, along with core clinical observations. RESULTS: We included five children from 10 months to 6 years of age (mean 3.4 years). All had had at least one CT scan after admission. Three of these five had CT abnormality on the first CT scan (at 2 days, 4 days and 9 days, respectively, after onset of symptoms) in the form of patchy ground-glass opacities; all normalised during treatment. CONCLUSION: Compared to reports in adults, we found similar but more modest lung abnormalities at CT in our small paediatric cohort.","Li, Wei | Cui, Huaqian | Li, Kunwei | Fang, Yijie | Li, Shaolin",Li W | Cui H | Li K | Fang Y | Li S,"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, Department of Radiology, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, 52 East Meihua Road, New Xiangzhou, Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, China. | Department of Medical Affairs, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, 52 East Meihua Road, New Xiangzhou, Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, China. | Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, Department of Radiology, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, 52 East Meihua Road, New Xiangzhou, Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, China. | Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, Department of Radiology, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, 52 East Meihua Road, New Xiangzhou, Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, China. | Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, Department of Radiology, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, 52 East Meihua Road, New Xiangzhou, Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, China. lishlin5@mail.sysu.edu.cn.",eng,Journal Article,20200311,Germany,Pediatr Radiol,Pediatric radiology,0365332,IM,NOTNLM,COVID-19 | Child | Computed tomography | Coronavirus | Pneumonia | Viral,2020/03/13 06:00,2020/03/13 06:00,2020/03/13 06:00,2020/02/18 00:00 [received] | 2020/03/02 00:00 [accepted] | 2020/02/18 00:00 [revised] | 2020/03/13 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/13 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/13 06:00 [medline],10.1007/s00247-020-04656-7 [pii] | 10.1007/s00247-020-04656-7 [doi],aheadofprint,Pediatr Radiol. 2020 Mar 11. doi: 10.1007/s00247-020-04656-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell entry of coronaviruses depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptors and on S protein priming by host cell proteases. Unravelling which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option. Finally, we show that the sera from convalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized SARS-2-S-driven entry. Our results reveal important commonalities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection and identify a potential target for antiviral intervention.","Hoffmann, Markus | Kleine-Weber, Hannah | Schroeder, Simon | Krüger, Nadine | Herrler, Tanja | Erichsen, Sandra | Schiergens, Tobias S | Herrler, Georg | Wu, Nai-Huei | Nitsche, Andreas | Müller, Marcel A | Drosten, Christian | Pöhlmann, Stefan",Hoffmann M | Kleine-Weber H | Schroeder S | Krüger N | Herrler T | Erichsen S | Schiergens TS | Herrler G | Wu NH | Nitsche A | Müller MA | Drosten C | Pöhlmann S,"Infection Biology Unit, German Primate Center - Leibniz Institute for Primate Research, Göttingen, Germany.

METHODS: We collected data from ten COVID-19 patients admitted between January 22, 2020 and February 11, 2020 at Xixi hospital in Hangzhou, China. RESULTS: Of ten patients, secondary, tertiary and quartus patients emerged, the incubation period was 3-7 days. Mainly initial symptoms were cough and low fever (37.3-38.0 ℃). An asymptomatic case presented normal radiography, the others existed ground glass opacities. All cases (three transferred, seven discharged) exposed to lopinavir on initial hospitalization. Three patients stopped lopinavir using because of adverse effect, two of them deteriorated, one hospitalized longer than others who with sustained lopinavir using. Levels of potassium, albumin, lymphocyte were low, but increased persistently after treatment. Eosinophil values were low on initial hospitalization, then all returned to normal before discharge. Viral load of SARS-CoV-2, radiography and eosinophil improved continuously in 3-14, 6-8 and 7-9 days, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing eosinophils may be an indicator of COVID-19 improvement. The COVID-19 patients may benefit from sustained lopinavir using. More researches on a larger scale are needed to verify these points.","Liu, Fang | Xu, Aifang | Zhang, Yan | Xuan, Weiling | Yan, Tingbo | Pan, Kenv | Yu, Wenyan | Zhang, Jun",Liu F | Xu A | Zhang Y | Xuan W | Yan T | Pan K | Yu W | Zhang J,"Medical Laboratory, Xixi Hospital of Hangzhou, Hangzhou, China. | Medical Laboratory, Xixi Hospital of Hangzhou, Hangzhou, China. | Medical Laboratory, Xixi Hospital of Hangzhou, Hangzhou, China; Department of Clinical Laboratory, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China. | Department of Radiology, Xixi Hospital of Hangzhou, Hangzhou, China. | Department of Radiology, Xixi Hospital of Hangzhou, Hangzhou, China. | Medical Laboratory, Xixi Hospital of Hangzhou, Hangzhou, China. | Medical Laboratory, Xixi Hospital of Hangzhou, Hangzhou, China. | Department of Clinical Laboratory, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.

Using publicly available event-date data from the ongoing epidemic, the present study investigated the incubation period and other time intervals that govern the epidemiological dynamics of COVID-19 infections. Our results show that the incubation period falls within the range of 2-14 days with 95% confidence and has a mean of around 5 days when approximated using the best-fit lognormal distribution. The mean time from illness onset to hospital admission (for treatment and/or isolation) was estimated at 3-4 days without truncation and at 5-9 days when right truncated. Based on the 95th percentile estimate of the incubation period, we recommend that the length of quarantine should be at least 14 days. The median time delay of 13 days from illness onset to death (17 days with right truncation) should be considered when estimating the COVID-19 case fatality risk.","Linton, Natalie M | Kobayashi, Tetsuro | Yang, Yichi | Hayashi, Katsuma | Akhmetzhanov, Andrei R | Jung, Sung-Mok | Yuan, Baoyin | Kinoshita, Ryo | Nishiura, Hiroshi",Linton NM | Kobayashi T | Yang Y | Hayashi K | Akhmetzhanov AR | Jung SM | Yuan B | Kinoshita R | Nishiura H,"Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Kita 15 Jo Nishi 7 Chome, Kita-ku, Sapporo-shi, Hokkaido 060-8638, Japan. | Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Kita 15 Jo Nishi 7 Chome, Kita-ku, Sapporo-shi, Hokkaido 060-8638, Japan. | Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Kita 15 Jo Nishi 7 Chome, Kita-ku, Sapporo-shi, Hokkaido 060-8638, Japan. | Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Kita 15 Jo Nishi 7 Chome, Kita-ku, Sapporo-shi, Hokkaido 060-8638, Japan. | Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Kita 15 Jo Nishi 7 Chome, Kita-ku, Sapporo-shi, Hokkaido 060-8638, Japan. | Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Kita 15 Jo Nishi 7 Chome, Kita-ku, Sapporo-shi, Hokkaido 060-8638, Japan. | Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Kita 15 Jo Nishi 7 Chome, Kita-ku, Sapporo-shi, Hokkaido 060-8638, Japan. | Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Kita 15 Jo Nishi 7 Chome, Kita-ku, Sapporo-shi, Hokkaido 060-8638, Japan. | Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Kita 15 Jo Nishi 7 Chome, Kita-ku, Sapporo-shi, Hokkaido 060-8638, Japan. | Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST), Japan Science and Technology Agency, Honcho 4-1-8, Kawaguchi, Saitama 332-0012, Japan.",eng,Journal Article,20200217,Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,,NOTNLM,distribution | emerging infectious diseases | epidemiology | incubation period | virus,2020/02/23 06:00,2020/02/23 06:01,2020/02/22 06:00,2020/01/25 00:00 [received] | 2020/02/08 00:00 [revised] | 2020/02/10 00:00 [accepted] | 2020/02/22 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/02/23 06:01 [medline],jcm9020538 [pii] | 10.3390/jcm9020538 [doi],epublish,J Clin Med. 2020 Feb 17;9(2):E538. doi: 10.3390/jcm9020538.,,"JP18fk0108050/Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development/ | H.N.: 17H04701, 17H05808, 18H04895 and 19H01074; R.K.: 18J21587/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science/ | NA/Inamori Foundation/ | JPMJCR1413/Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology/ | NA/Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology/ | NA/China Scholarship Council/",,,ORCID: 0000-0002-5464-0076 | ORCID: 0000-0003-3269-7351 | ORCID: 0000-0002-0787-4515 | ORCID: 0000-0002-0116-4598 | ORCID: 0000-0003-0941-8537,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Risk factors for the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 pneumonia have not yet been well delineated. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or died. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study of 201 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital in China between December 25, 2019, and January 26, 2020. The final date of follow-up was February 13, 2020. EXPOSURES: Confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The development of ARDS and death. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, management, treatment, and outcome data were also collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Of 201 patients, the median age was 51 years (interquartile range, 43-60 years), and 128 (63.7%) patients were men. Eighty-four patients (41.8%) developed ARDS, and of those 84 patients, 44 (52.4%) died. In those who developed ARDS, compared with those who did not, more patients presented with dyspnea (50 of 84 [59.5%] patients and 30 of 117 [25.6%] patients, respectively [difference, 33.9%; 95% CI, 19.7%-48.1%]) and had comorbidities such as hypertension (23 of 84 [27.4%] patients and 16 of 117 [13.7%] patients, respectively [difference, 13.7%; 95% CI, 1.3%-26.1%]) and diabetes (16 of 84 [19.0%] patients and 6 of 117 [5.1%] patients, respectively [difference, 13.9%; 95% CI, 3.6%-24.2%]). In bivariate Cox regression analysis, risk factors associated with the development of ARDS and progression from ARDS to death included older age (hazard ratio [HR], 3.26; 95% CI 2.08-5.11; and HR, 6.17; 95% CI, 3.26-11.67, respectively), neutrophilia (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.09-1.19; and HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.17, respectively), and organ and coagulation dysfunction (eg, higher lactate dehydrogenase [HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.44-1.79; and HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.11-1.52, respectively] and D-dimer [HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04; and HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04, respectively]). High fever (≥39 °C) was associated with higher likelihood of ARDS development (HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.11-2.84) and lower likelihood of death (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.21-0.82). Among patients with ARDS, treatment with methylprednisolone decreased the risk of death (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.20-0.72). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Older age was associated with greater risk of development of ARDS and death likely owing to less rigorous immune response. Although high fever was associated with the development of ARDS, it was also associated with better outcomes among patients with ARDS. Moreover, treatment with methylprednisolone may be beneficial for patients who develop ARDS.","Wu, Chaomin | Chen, Xiaoyan | Cai, Yanping | Xia, Jia'an | Zhou, Xing | Xu, Sha | Huang, Hanping | Zhang, Li | Zhou, Xia | Du, Chunling | Zhang, Yuye | Song, Juan | Wang, Sijiao | Chao, Yencheng | Yang, Zeyong | Xu, Jie | Zhou, Xin | Chen, Dechang | Xiong, Weining | Xu, Lei | Zhou, Feng | Jiang, Jinjun | Bai, Chunxue | Zheng, Junhua | Song, Yuanlin",Wu C | Chen X | Cai Y | Xia J | Zhou X | Xu S | Huang H | Zhang L | Zhou X | Du C | Zhang Y | Song J | Wang S | Chao Y | Yang Z | Xu J | Zhou X | Chen D | Xiong W | Xu L | Zhou F | Jiang J | Bai C | Zheng J | Song Y,"Department of Pulmonary Medicine, QingPu Branch of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University, Shanghai, China. | Infection Division, Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China. | Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. | Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. | Infection Division, Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China. | Tuberculosis and Respiratory Department, Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China. | Infection Division, Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China. | Infection Division, Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China. | Tuberculosis and Respiratory Department, Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China. | Tuberculosis and Respiratory Department, Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China. | Tuberculosis and Respiratory Department, Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China. | Department of Pulmonary Medicine, QingPu Branch of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University, Shanghai, China. | Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. | Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. | Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. | Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. | Department of Anesthesiology, International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China. | Department of Infectious Diseases, Fengxian Guhua Hospital, Shanghai, China. | Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China. | Department of Critical Care Medicine, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China. | Department of Respiratory Medicine, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China. | Department of Emergency Medicine, Shanghai Pudong New Area Gongli Hospital, Shanghai, China. | Department of Pulmonary Medicine, QingPu Branch of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University, Shanghai, China. | Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. | Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. | Shanghai Respiratory Research Institute, Shanghai, China. | Department of Urology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China. | Department of Pulmonary Medicine, QingPu Branch of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University, Shanghai, China. | Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. | Shanghai Respiratory Research Institute, Shanghai, China. | National Clinical Research Center for Aging and Medicine, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.",eng,Journal Article,20200313,,JAMA Intern Med,JAMA internal medicine,101589534,AIM | IM,,,2020/03/14 06:00,2020/03/14 06:00,2020/03/14 06:00,2021/03/13 00:00 [pmc-release] | 2020/03/14 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/14 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/14 06:00 [medline],2763184 [pii] | ioi200022 [pii] | 10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.0994 [doi],aheadofprint,JAMA Intern Med. 2020 Mar 13:e200994. doi: 10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.0994.,,,Conflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.,,,,,,PMC7070509,,,,,,,,,2021/03/13,,

The disease condition associated with novel coronavirus, referred to as Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The emergence of novel coronavirus in 2019 in Wuhan, China marked the third highly pathogenic coronavirus infecting humans in the 21st century. The continuing emergence of coronaviruses at regular intervals poses a significant threat to human health and economy. Ironically, even after a decade of research on coronavirus, still there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutic agents to treat coronavirus infection which highlights an urgent need to develop effective vaccines or post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent future epidemics. Several clinical, genetic and epidemiological features of COVID-19 resemble SARS-CoV infection. Hence, the research advancements on SARS-CoV treatment might help scientific community in quick understanding of this virus pathogenesis and develop effective therapeutic/prophylactic agents to treat and prevent this infection. Monoclonal antibodies represent the major class of biotherapeutics for passive immunotherapy to fight against viral infection. The therapeutic potential of monoclonal antibodies has been well recognized in the treatment of many diseases. Here, we summarize the potential monoclonal antibody based therapeutic intervention for COVID-19 by considering the existing knowledge on the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against similar coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Further research on COVID-19 pathogenesis could identify appropriate therapeutic targets to develop specific anti-virals against this newly emerging pathogen.","Shanmugaraj, Balamurugan | Siriwattananon, Konlavat | Wangkanont, Kittikhun | Phoolcharoen, Waranyoo",Shanmugaraj B | Siriwattananon K | Wangkanont K | Phoolcharoen W,"Research unit for Plant-produced Pharmaceuticals, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand. | Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Botany, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand. | Research unit for Plant-produced Pharmaceuticals, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand. | Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Botany, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand. | Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand. | Research unit for Plant-produced Pharmaceuticals, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand. | Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Botany, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.",eng,Journal Article,20200304,Thailand,Asian Pac J Allergy Immunol,Asian Pacific journal of allergy and immunology,8402034,IM,,,2020/03/07 06:00,2020/03/07 06:00,2020/03/06 06:00,2020/03/06 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/07 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/07 06:00 [medline],10.12932/AP-200220-0773 [doi],aheadofprint,Asian Pac J Allergy Immunol. 2020 Mar 4. doi: 10.12932/AP-200220-0773.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The previous epidemics of high-morbidity human coronaviruses, such as the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, prompted the characterization of compounds that could be potentially active against the currently emerging novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The most promising compound is remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleotide analog prodrug currently in clinical trials for treating Ebola virus infections. Remdesivir inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in tissue cultures, and it displayed efficacy in non-human animal models. In addition, a combination of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitors, lopinavir/ritonavir, and interferon beta (LPV/RTV-INFb) were shown to be effective in patients infected with SARS-CoV. LPV/RTV-INFb also improved clinical parameters in marmosets and mice infected with MERS-CoV. Remarkably, the therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir appeared to be superior to that of LPV/RTV-INFb against MERS-CoV in a transgenic humanized mice model. The relatively high mortality rates associated with these three novel human coronavirus infections, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, has suggested that pro-inflammatory responses might play a role in the pathogenesis. It remains unknown whether the generated inflammatory state should be targeted. Therapeutics that target the coronavirus alone might not be able to reverse highly pathogenic infections. This minireview aimed to provide a summary of therapeutic compounds that showed potential in fighting SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Martinez, Miguel Angel",Martinez MA,"IrsiCaixa, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB), Badalona, Spain mmartinez@irsicaixa.es.",eng,Journal Article | Review,20200309,United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,IM,,,2020/03/11 06:00,2020/03/11 06:00,2020/03/11 06:00,2020/03/11 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/11 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/11 06:00 [medline],AAC.00399-20 [pii] | 10.1128/AAC.00399-20 [doi],aheadofprint,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2020 Mar 9:AAC.00399-20. doi: 10.1128/AAC.00399-20.,Copyright © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.,,,,ORCID: 0000-0002-6681-4950,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the virus (SARS-Cov-2) nucleic acid RT-PCR test has become the standard method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, these real-time PCR test kits have many limitations. In addition, high false negative rates were reported. There is an urgent need for an accurate and rapid test method to quickly identify large number of infected patients and asymptomatic carriers to prevent virus transmission and assure timely treatment of patients. We have developed a rapid and simple point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay which can detect IgM and IgG antibodies simultaneously against SARS-CoV-2 virus in human blood within 15 minutes which can detect patients at different infection stages. With this test kit, we carried out clinical studies to validate its clinical efficacy uses. The clinical detection sensitivity and specificity of this test were measured using blood samples collected from 397 PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients and 128 negative patients at 8 different clinical sites. The overall testing sensitivity was 88.66% and specificity was 90.63%. In addition, we evaluated clinical diagnosis results obtained from different types of venous and fingerstick blood samples. The results indicated great detection consistency among samples from fingerstick blood, serum and plasma of venous blood. The IgM-IgG combined assay has better utility and sensitivity compared with a single IgM or IgG test. It can be used for the rapid screening of SARS-CoV-2 carriers, symptomatic or asymptomatic, in hospitals, clinics, and test laboratories. This article is protected by copyright.

We aimed to quantify severity of COVID-19 infection on High-Resolution CT and to determine its relationship with clinical parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From Jan 11, 2020, to Feb 5, 2020, the clinical, laboratory and HRCT features of 42 patients (26-75 years, 25 males) with COVID-19 were analyzed. The initial and follow-up CT obtained a mean of 4.5 days and 11.6 days from the illness onset were retrospectively assessed for the severity and progression of pneumonia. Correlations among clinical parameters, initial CT features and progression of opacifications were evaluated with Spearman correlation and linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-five (83%) patients exhibited a progressive process according to CT features during the early stage from onset. Follow-up CT findings showed progressive opacifications, consolidation, interstitial thickening, fibrous strips and air bronchograms, compared to initial CT (all p<0.05). Before regular treatments, there was a moderate correlation between the days from onset and sum score of opacifications (R=0.68, p<0.01). The C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and lactate dehydrogenase showed significantly positive correlation with the severity of pneumonia assessed on initial CT (R range 0.36-0.75, p<0.05). The highest temperature and the severity of opacifications assessed on initial CT were significantly related to the progression of opacifications on follow-up CT (p=0.001-0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with the COVID-19 infection usually presented with typical ground-grass opacities and other CT features, which showed significant correlations with some clinical and laboratory measurements. Follow-up CT images often demonstrated progressions during the early stage from illness onset.","Xiong, Ying | Sun, Dong | Liu, Yao | Fan, Yanqing | Zhao, Lingyun | Li, Xiaoming | Zhu, Wenzhen",Xiong Y | Sun D | Liu Y | Fan Y | Zhao L | Li X | Zhu W,"Departments of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. | Departments of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. | Departments of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. | Departments of Radiology, Jin Yin-tan Hospital, Wuhan, China. | Departments of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. | Departments of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. | Departments of Radiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.",eng,Journal Article,20200303,United States,Invest Radiol,Investigative radiology,0045377,IM,,,2020/03/07 06:00,2020/03/07 06:00,2020/03/06 06:00,2020/03/06 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/07 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/07 06:00 [medline],10.1097/RLI.0000000000000674 [doi],aheadofprint,Invest Radiol. 2020 Mar 3. doi: 10.1097/RLI.0000000000000674.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aims to investigate the factors affecting the progression of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. Associated results will be used to evaluate the prognosis and to find the optimal treatment regimens for COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Patients tested positive for the COVID-19 based on nucleic acid detection were included in this study. Patients were admitted to 3 tertiary hospitals in Wuhan between December 30, 2019, and January 15, 2020. Individual data, laboratory indices, imaging characteristics, and clinical data were collected, and statistical analysis was performed. Based on clinical typing results, the patients were divided into a progression group or an improvement/stabilization group. Continuous variables were analyzed using independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were analyzed using Chi-squared test or Fisher exact test. Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the risk factors for disease progression. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients with COVID-19-induced pneumonia met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study. Efficacy evaluation at 2 weeks after hospitalization indicated that 11 patients (14.1%) had deteriorated, and 67 patients (85.9%) had improved/stabilized. The patients in the progression group were significantly older than those in the disease improvement/stabilization group (66 [51, 70] vs. 37 [32, 41] years, U = 4.932, P = 0.001). The progression group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking than the improvement/stabilization group (27.3% vs. 3.0%, χ = 9.291, P = 0.018). For all the 78 patients, fever was the most common initial symptom, and the maximum body temperature at admission was significantly higher in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group (38.2 [37.8, 38.6] vs. 37.5 [37.0, 38.4]°C, U = 2.057, P = 0.027). Moreover, the proportion of patients with respiratory failure (54.5% vs. 20.9%, χ = 5.611, P = 0.028) and respiratory rate (34 [18, 48] vs. 24 [16, 60] breaths/min, U = 4.030, P = 0.004) were significantly higher in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group. C-reactive protein was significantly elevated in the progression group compared to the improvement/stabilization group (38.9 [14.3, 64.8] vs. 10.6 [1.9, 33.1] mg/L, U = 1.315, P = 0.024). Albumin was significantly lower in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group (36.62 ± 6.60 vs. 41.27 ± 4.55 g/L, U = 2.843, P = 0.006). Patients in the progression group were more likely to receive high-level respiratory support than in the improvement/stabilization group (χ = 16.01, P = 0.001). Multivariate logistic analysis indicated that age (odds ratio [OR], 8.546; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.628-44.864; P = 0.011), history of smoking (OR, 14.285; 95% CI: 1.577-25.000; P = 0.018), maximum body temperature at admission (OR, 8.999; 95% CI: 1.036-78.147, P = 0.046), respiratory failure (OR, 8.772, 95% CI: 1.942-40.000; P = 0.016), albumin (OR, 7.353, 95% CI: 1.098-50.000; P = 0.003), and C-reactive protein (OR, 10.530; 95% CI: 1.224-34.701, P = 0.028) were risk factors for disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: Several factors that led to the progression of COVID-19 pneumonia were identified, including age, history of smoking, maximum body temperature on admission, respiratory failure, albumin, C-reactive protein. These results can be used to further enhance the ability of management of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Liu, Wei | Tao, Zhao-Wu | Lei, Wang | Ming-Li, Yuan | Kui, Liu | Ling, Zhou | Shuang, Wei | Yan, Deng | Jing, Liu | Liu, Hui-Guo | Ming, Yang | Yi, Hu",Liu W | Tao ZW | Lei W | Ming-Li Y | Kui L | Ling Z | Shuang W | Yan D | Jing L | Liu HG | Ming Y | Yi H,"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430014, China. | Department of Respiratory Intensive Care Unit, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430014, China. | Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430014, China. | Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430014, China. | Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430030, China. | Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430030, China. | Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430030, China. | Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430030, China. | Department of Radiology, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430030, China. | Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430030, China. | The Provost's Office, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430014, China. | Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430014, China.",eng,Journal Article,20200228,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,IM,,,2020/03/03 06:00,2020/03/03 06:00,2020/03/03 06:00,2020/03/03 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/03 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/03 06:00 [medline],10.1097/CM9.0000000000000775 [doi],aheadofprint,Chin Med J (Engl). 2020 Feb 28. doi: 10.1097/CM9.0000000000000775.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients infected with 2019-nCoV are at risk for developing respiratory failure and requiring admission to critical care units. While providing optimal treatment for these patients, careful execution of infection control measures is necessary to prevent nosocomial transmission to other patients and to healthcare workers providing care. Although the exact mechanisms of transmission are currently unclear, human-to-human transmission can occur, and the risk of airborne spread during aerosol-generating medical procedures remains a concern in specific circumstances. This paper summarizes important considerations regarding patient screening, environmental controls, personal protective equipment, resuscitation measures (including intubation), and critical care unit operations planning as we prepare for the possibility of new imported cases or local outbreaks of 2019-nCoV. Although understanding of the 2019-nCoV virus is evolving, lessons learned from prior infectious disease challenges such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome will hopefully improve our state of readiness regardless of the number of cases we eventually manage in Canada.","Wax, Randy S | Christian, Michael D",Wax RS | Christian MD,"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada. randy.wax@queensu.ca. | Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada. randy.wax@queensu.ca. | Department of Critical Care Medicine, Lakeridge Health, 1 Hospital Court, Oshawa, ON, L1G 2B9, Canada. randy.wax@queensu.ca. | London's Air Ambulance, Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust, London, England, UK.",eng,Journal Article | Review,20200212,United States,Can J Anaesth,Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,8701709,IM,NOTNLM,COVID-19,2020/02/14 06:00,2020/02/14 06:00,2020/02/14 06:00,2020/02/07 00:00 [received] | 2020/02/07 00:00 [accepted] | 2020/02/14 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/02/14 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/02/14 06:00 [medline],10.1007/s12630-020-01591-x [pii] | 10.1007/s12630-020-01591-x [doi],aheadofprint,Can J Anaesth. 2020 Feb 12. doi: 10.1007/s12630-020-01591-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Directives concrètes à l’intention des équipes de soins intensifs et d’anesthésiologie prenant soin de patients atteints du coronavirus 2019-nCoV.,

The continuous evolution of coronaviruses was further highlighted with the emergence of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) outbreak in 2012. Currently, the world is concerned about the 2019 novel CoV (SARS-CoV-2) that was initially identified in the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019. Patients presented with severe viral pneumonia and respiratory illness. The number of cases has been mounting since then. As of late February 2020, tens of thousands of cases and several thousand deaths have been reported in China alone, in addition to thousands of cases in other countries. Although the fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 is currently lower than SARS-CoV, the virus seems to be highly contagious based on the number of infected cases to date. In this review, we discuss structure, genome organization, entry of CoVs into target cells, and provide insights into past and present outbreaks. The future of human CoV outbreaks will not only depend on how the viruses will evolve, but will also depend on how we develop efficient prevention and treatment strategies to deal with this continuous threat.","Ashour, Hossam M | Elkhatib, Walid F | Rahman, Md Masudur | Elshabrawy, Hatem A",Ashour HM | Elkhatib WF | Rahman MM | Elshabrawy HA,"Department of Biological Sciences, College of Arts and Sciences, University of South Florida St. Petersburg, St. Petersburg, FL 33701, USA. | Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Cairo 11562, Egypt. | Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Industries, Badr University in Cairo (BUC), Entertainment Area, Badr City, Cairo 11829, Egypt. | Microbiology and Immunology Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ain Shams University, African Union Organization St., Abbassia, Cairo 11566, Egypt. | Department of Pathology, Faculty of Veterinary, Animal and Biomedical Sciences, Sylhet Agricultural University, Sylhet 3100, Bangladesh. | Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, College of Osteopathic Medicine, Sam Houston State University, Conroe, TX 77304, USA.",eng,Journal Article | Review,20200304,Switzerland,Pathogens,"Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",101596317,,NOTNLM,2019-nCoV | COVID-19 | MERS | SARS | SARS-CoV-2,2020/03/08 06:00,2020/03/08 06:01,2020/03/08 06:00,2020/02/05 00:00 [received] | 2020/02/23 00:00 [revised] | 2020/03/02 00:00 [accepted] | 2020/03/08 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/08 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/08 06:01 [medline],pathogens9030186 [pii] | 10.3390/pathogens9030186 [doi],epublish,Pathogens. 2020 Mar 4;9(3):E186. doi: 10.3390/pathogens9030186.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the systemic immunosuppressive state caused by malignancy and anticancer treatments, patients with advanced lung cancer may be at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection. During epidemic of COVID-19, a guideline for the optimal management of patients with advanced lung cancer urgently needs to be proposed to distinguish the symptoms of COVID-19 and the side effects of antitumor drugs. This network questionnaire survey was conducted on the lung cancer group of the Chinese Thoracic Society, Chinese Medical Association; the lung cancer group of the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology Youth Committee; and the Chinese Respiratory Oncology Collaboration. 321 valid questionnaires were received. Based on the guidelines on lung cancer and the results of the questionnaires, a consensus was reached. During the epidemic of COVID-19, We recommended that patients with advanced NSCLC should be treated as outpatients as possible at the nearest medical center; Patients who need to be hospitalized for antitumor treatment should be excluded from COVID-19 infection; More intensive attention should be paid to identification of COVID-19-related symptoms and adverse reactions caused by the malignancy or antitumor treatments.

Fourteen cases have been diagnosed in the United States, and an additional 39 cases have occurred among repatriated persons from high-risk settings, for a current total of 53 cases within the United States. This report summarizes the aggressive measures (2,3) that CDC, state and local health departments, multiple other federal agencies, and other partners are implementing to slow and try to contain transmission of COVID-19 in the United States. These measures require the identification of cases and contacts of persons with COVID-19 in the United States and the recommended assessment, monitoring, and care of travelers arriving from areas with substantial COVID-19 transmission. Although these measures might not prevent widespread transmission of the virus in the United States, they are being implemented to 1) slow the spread of illness; 2) provide time to better prepare state and local health departments, health care systems, businesses, educational organizations, and the general public in the event that widespread transmission occurs; and 3) better characterize COVID-19 to guide public health recommendations and the development and deployment of medical countermeasures, including diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. U.S. public health authorities are monitoring the situation closely, and CDC is coordinating efforts with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other global partners.

METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the clinical, imaging, and laboratory characteristics of confirmed cases of COVID-19 with WHO interim guidance in three Grade ⅢA hospitals of Jiangsu from Jan 22 to Feb 14, 2020. Real time RT-PCR was used to detect the new coronavirus in respiratory samples. RESULTS: Of the 80 patients infected with COVID-19, 41 patients were female, with a median age of 46.1 years. Except for 3 severe patients, the rest of the 77 patients exhibited mild or moderate symptoms. 9 patients were unconfirmed until a third-time nucleic acid test. 38 cases had a history of chronic diseases. The main clinical manifestations of the patients were fever and cough, which accounted for 63 cases (78.75%) and 51 cases (-63.75%) respectively. Only 3 patients (3.75%) showed liver dysfunction. Imaging examination showed that 55 patients (-68.75%) showed abnormal, 25 cases (31.25%) had no abnormal density shadow in the parenchyma of both lungs. Up to now, 21 cases were discharged from the hospital, and no patient died. The average length of stay for discharged patients was 8 days. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the cases in Wuhan, the cases in Jiangsu exhibited mild or moderate symptoms and no obvious gender susceptivity. The proportion of patients having liver dysfunction and abnormal CT imaging was relatively lower than that of Wuhan. Notably, infected patients may be falsely excluded based on two consecutively negative respiratory pathogenic nucleic acid test results.","Wu, Jian | Liu, Jun | Zhao, Xinguo | Liu, Chengyuan | Wang, Wei | Wang, Dawei | Xu, Wei | Zhang, Chunyu | Yu, Jiong | Jiang, Bin | Cao, Hongcui | Li, Lanjuan",Wu J | Liu J | Zhao X | Liu C | Wang W | Wang D | Xu W | Zhang C | Yu J | Jiang B | Cao H | Li L,"State Key Laboratory for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China. | Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First People's Hospital of Yancheng City, Yancheng, China. | Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Fifth People's Hospital of Wuxi, Affiliated to Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China. | Department of Respiration, The Fifth People's Hospital of Wuxi, Affiliated to Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China. | Department of Infectious Disease, The First People's Hospital of Yancheng City, Yancheng, China. | Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First People's Hospital of Yancheng City, Yancheng, China. | Department of Infectious Disease, The second People's Hospital of Yancheng City, Yancheng, China. | Department of Preventive Medicine and Public Health Laboratory Sciences, School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China. | Department of Laboratory Medicine, The second People's Hospital of Yancheng City, Yancheng, China. | State Key Laboratory for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China. | Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Central Blood Station of Yancheng City, Yancheng, Jiangsu, China. | State Key Laboratory for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China. | Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Aging and Physic-chemical Injury Diseases, Hangzhou, China. | State Key Laboratory for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.",eng,Journal Article,20200229,United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,IM,NOTNLM,Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) | clinical characteristics | imported cases | pneumonia,2020/02/29 06:00,2020/02/29 06:00,2020/02/29 06:00,2020/02/08 00:00 [received] | 2020/02/29 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/02/29 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/02/29 06:00 [medline],5766408 [pii] | 10.1093/cid/ciaa199 [doi],aheadofprint,Clin Infect Dis. 2020 Feb 29:ciaa199. doi: 10.1093/cid/ciaa199.,"© The Author(s) 2020.

It is timely to systematically review the potential of these interventions, including those for Middle East respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, to guide policymakers globally on their prioritization of resources for research and development. A systematic search was carried out in three major electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Supplementary strategies through Google Search and personal communications were used. A total of 27 studies fulfilled the criteria for review. Several laboratory protocols for confirmation of suspected 2019-nCoV cases using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been published. A commercial RT-PCR kit developed by the Beijing Genomic Institute is currently widely used in China and likely in Asia. However, serological assays as well as point-of-care testing kits have not been developed but are likely in the near future. Several vaccine candidates are in the pipeline. The likely earliest Phase 1 vaccine trial is a synthetic DNA-based candidate. A number of novel compounds as well as therapeutics licensed for other conditions appear to have in vitro efficacy against the 2019-nCoV. Some are being tested in clinical trials against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, while others have been listed for clinical trials against 2019-nCoV. However, there are currently no effective specific antivirals or drug combinations supported by high-level evidence.","Pang, Junxiong | Wang, Min Xian | Ang, Ian Yi Han | Tan, Sharon Hui Xuan | Lewis, Ruth Frances | Chen, Jacinta I-Pei | Gutierrez, Ramona A | Gwee, Sylvia Xiao Wei | Chua, Pearleen Ee Yong | Yang, Qian | Ng, Xian Yi | Yap, Rowena Ks | Tan, Hao Yi | Teo, Yik Ying | Tan, Chorh Chuan | Cook, Alex R | Yap, Jason Chin-Huat | Hsu, Li Yang",Pang J | Wang MX | Ang IYH | Tan SHX | Lewis RF | Chen JI | Gutierrez RA | Gwee SXW | Chua PEY | Yang Q | Ng XY | Yap RK | Tan HY | Teo YY | Tan CC | Cook AR | Yap JC | Hsu LY,"Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore and National University Health System, Singapore 117549, Singapore. | Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Research, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117549, Singapore. | Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore and National University Health System, Singapore 117549, Singapore. | Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Research, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117549, Singapore. | Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore and National University Health System, Singapore 117549, Singapore. | Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore and National University Health System, Singapore 117549, Singapore. | Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore and National University Health System, Singapore 117549, Singapore. | Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore and National University Health System, Singapore 117549, Singapore. | National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore 308442, Singapore. | Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore and National University Health System, Singapore 117549, Singapore. | Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Research, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117549, Singapore. | Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore and National University Health System, Singapore 117549, Singapore. | Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Research, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117549, Singapore. | Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore and National University Health System, Singapore 117549, Singapore. | Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore and National University Health System, Singapore 117549, Singapore. | Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore and National University Health System, Singapore 117549, Singapore. | Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore and National University Health System, Singapore 117549, Singapore. | Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore and National University Health System, Singapore 117549, Singapore. | Ministry of Health, Singapore 169854, Singapore. | Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore and National University Health System, Singapore 117549, Singapore. | Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore and National University Health System, Singapore 117549, Singapore. | Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore and National University Health System, Singapore 117549, Singapore.",eng,Journal Article | Review,20200226,Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,,NOTNLM,MERS-CoV | SARS-CoV | diagnostics | global health | novel coronavirus | outbreak | treatments | vaccine,2020/03/01 06:00,2020/03/01 06:01,2020/03/01 06:00,2020/02/13 00:00 [received] | 2020/02/17 00:00 [revised] | 2020/02/19 00:00 [accepted] | 2020/03/01 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/01 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/01 06:01 [medline],jcm9030623 [pii] | 10.3390/jcm9030623 [doi],epublish,J Clin Med. 2020 Feb 26;9(3):E623. doi: 10.3390/jcm9030623.,,N-608-000-065-001/Ministry of Defence/ | 0000001/Ministry of Health/,The authors declare no conflict of interest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir, ribavirin or ritonavir have shown efficacy to inhibit coronavirus in vitro. Teicoplanin, an antibiotic used to treat staphylococci infection, previously showed efficacy to inhibit the first stage of MERS-coronarivus viral cycle in human cells.

We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients. METHODS: All patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan. We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records. Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not. FINDINGS: By Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]). Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0-58·0). 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market. One family cluster was found. Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38). Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0-13·0]). 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia. All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]). 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα. INTERPRETATION: The 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality. Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.

We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data. Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020. FINDINGS: Of the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women. 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR. 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases. Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient). According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax. 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure. INTERPRETATION: The 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia. Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection.

DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: Seven hospitals in Zhejiang province, China. PARTICIPANTS: 62 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection. Data were collected from 10 January 2020 to 26 January 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical data, collected using a standardised case report form, such as temperature, history of exposure, incubation period. If information was not clear, the working group in Hangzhou contacted the doctor responsible for treating the patient for clarification. RESULTS: Of the 62 patients studied (median age 41 years), only one was admitted to an intensive care unit, and no patients died during the study. According to research, none of the infected patients in Zhejiang province were ever exposed to the Huanan seafood market, the original source of the virus; all studied cases were infected by human to human transmission. The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever in 48 (77%) patients, cough in 50 (81%), expectoration in 35 (56%), headache in 21 (34%), myalgia or fatigue in 32 (52%), diarrhoea in 3 (8%), and haemoptysis in 2 (3%). Only two patients (3%) developed shortness of breath on admission. The median time from exposure to onset of illness was 4 days (interquartile range 3-5 days), and from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 2 (1-4) days. CONCLUSION: As of early February 2020, compared with patients initially infected with SARS-Cov-2 in Wuhan, the symptoms of patients in Zhejiang province are relatively mild.","Xu, Xiao-Wei | Wu, Xiao-Xin | Jiang, Xian-Gao | Xu, Kai-Jin | Ying, Ling-Jun | Ma, Chun-Lian | Li, Shi-Bo | Wang, Hua-Ying | Zhang, Sheng | Gao, Hai-Nv | Sheng, Ji-Fang | Cai, Hong-Liu | Qiu, Yun-Qing | Li, Lan-Juan",Xu XW | Wu XX | Jiang XG | Xu KJ | Ying LJ | Ma CL | Li SB | Wang HY | Zhang S | Gao HN | Sheng JF | Cai HL | Qiu YQ | Li LJ,"State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Centre for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Centre for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, 310003, China. | State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Centre for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Centre for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, 310003, China. | Department of Infectious Disease, Wenzhou Central Hospital, Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, China. | State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Centre for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Centre for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, 310003, China. | Department of Infectious Disease, Taizhou Enze Medical Centre (Group), Enze Hospital, Taizhou, Zhejiang Province, China. | Department of Infectious Disease, First People's Hospital of Wenling, Wenling, Zhejiang Province, China. | Department of Infectious Disease, Affiliated Zhoushan Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Zhoushan, Zhejiang Province, China ljli@zju.edu.cn. | Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Yinzhou People's Hospital, Affiliated Yinzhou Hospital, College of Medicine, Ningbo University, Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, China. | Department of Infectious Disease, Taizhou Hospital, Taizhou, Zhejiang Province, China. | Department of Infectious Disease, ShuLan (Hangzhou) Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang Shuren University Shulan International Medical College, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China. | State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Centre for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Centre for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, 310003, China. | State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Centre for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Centre for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, 310003, China. | State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Centre for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Centre for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, 310003, China. | State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Centre for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Centre for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, 310003, China ljli@zju.edu.cn.",eng,Journal Article | Multicenter Study,20200219,England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,AIM | IM,,,2020/02/23 06:00,2020/02/29 06:00,2020/02/21 06:00,2020/02/21 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/02/29 06:00 [medline],10.1136/bmj.m606 [doi],epublish,BMJ. 2020 Feb 19;368:m606. doi: 10.1136/bmj.m606.,Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

At present, there is no definite and effective treatment for COVID-19. ACE2 plays an important role in the RAS, and the imbalance between ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway and ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway in the RAS system will lead to multi-system inflammation. Increased ACE and Ang II are poor prognostic factors for severe pneumonia. Animal studies have shown that RAS inhibitors could effectively relieve symptoms of acute severe pneumonia and respiratory failure. The binding of COVID-19 and ACE2 resulted in the exhaustion of ACE2, and then ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway was inhibited. The balance of the RAS system was broken, and this would lead to the exacerbation of acute severe pneumonia. Therefore, we speculate that ACEI and AT1R inhibitors could be used in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia under the condition of controlling blood pressure, and might reduce the pulmonary inflammatory response and mortality.","Sun, M L | Yang, J M | Sun, Y P | Su, G H | Wang, Tianbing | Du, Zhe | Zhu, Fengxue | Cao, Zhaolong | An, Youzhong | Gao, Yan | Jiang, Baoguo",Sun ML | Yang JM | Sun YP | Su GH | Wang T | Du Z | Zhu F | Cao Z | An Y | Gao Y | Jiang B,"Department of Oncology, Jinan Central Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan 250013, China. | The Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Remodeling and Function Research, Chinese Ministry of Education, Chinese Ministry of Health and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Department of Cardiology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China. | Department of Oncology, Jinan Central Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan 250013, China. | Department of Cardiology, Jinan Central Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan 250013, China. | Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China. | Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China. | Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China. | Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China. | Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China. | Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China. | Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China.

Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the epidemic. The aim of this study was to survey the general public in China to better understand their levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. The data will be used for future reference. Methods: From 31 January to 2 February 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques. The online survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact history with COVID-19, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to COVID-19. Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China. In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels. Most respondents spent 20-24 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%). Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.g., myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p < 0.05). Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.g., treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.g., hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p < 0.05). Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety. Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Wang, Cuiyan | Pan, Riyu | Wan, Xiaoyang | Tan, Yilin | Xu, Linkang | Ho, Cyrus S | Ho, Roger C",Wang C | Pan R | Wan X | Tan Y | Xu L | Ho CS | Ho RC,"Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, Faculty of Education, Huaibei Normal University, Huaibei 235000, China. | Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, Faculty of Education, Huaibei Normal University, Huaibei 235000, China. | Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, Faculty of Education, Huaibei Normal University, Huaibei 235000, China. | Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, Faculty of Education, Huaibei Normal University, Huaibei 235000, China. | Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, Faculty of Education, Huaibei Normal University, Huaibei 235000, China. | Department of Psychological Medicine, National University Health System, Kent Ridge 119228, Singapore. | Department of Psychological Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Kent Ridge 119228, Singapore. | Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, Faculty of Education, Huaibei Normal University, Huaibei 235000, China. | Department of Psychological Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Kent Ridge 119228, Singapore. | Institute of Health Innovation and Technology (iHealthtech), National University of Singapore, Kent Ridge 119077, Singapore.",eng,Journal Article,20200306,Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,IM,NOTNLM,*anxiety | *coronavirus | *depression | *epidemic | *knowledge | *precaution | *psychological impact | *respiratory symptoms | *stress,2020/03/12 06:00,2020/03/12 06:00,2020/03/12 06:00,2020/02/14 00:00 [received] | 2020/02/28 00:00 [revised] | 2020/03/03 00:00 [accepted] | 2020/03/12 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/12 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/12 06:00 [medline],ijerph17051729 [pii] | 10.3390/ijerph17051729 [doi],epublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2020 Mar 6;17(5):E1729. doi: 10.3390/ijerph17051729.,,,,,ORCID: 0000-0001-8612-5194 | ORCID: 0000-0002-7092-9566 | ORCID: 0000-0001-9629-4493,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions. We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: The pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells. Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data. Using the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen whilst considering the drug's safety profile. RESULTS: Hydroxychloroquine (EC50=0.72 μM) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47 μM) in vitro. Based on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it reached three times the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice daily 5 days in advance. CONCLUSIONS: Hydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.","Yao, Xueting | Ye, Fei | Zhang, Miao | Cui, Cheng | Huang, Baoying | Niu, Peihua | Liu, Xu | Zhao, Li | Dong, Erdan | Song, Chunli | Zhan, Siyan | Lu, Roujian | Li, Haiyan | Tan, Wenjie | Liu, Dongyang",Yao X | Ye F | Zhang M | Cui C | Huang B | Niu P | Liu X | Zhao L | Dong E | Song C | Zhan S | Lu R | Li H | Tan W | Liu D,"Drug Clinical Trial Center, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China. | MHC Key Laboratory of Biosafety, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC, Beijing, China. | Drug Clinical Trial Center, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China. | Drug Clinical Trial Center, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China. | MHC Key Laboratory of Biosafety, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC, Beijing, China. | MHC Key Laboratory of Biosafety, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC, Beijing, China. | Drug Clinical Trial Center, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China. | MHC Key Laboratory of Biosafety, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC, Beijing, China. | Department of Cardiology and Institute of Vascular Medicine, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China. | Department of Orthopedics, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China. | Research Center of Clinical Epidemiology, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China. | MHC Key Laboratory of Biosafety, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC, Beijing, China. | Drug Clinical Trial Center, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China. | Department of Cardiology and Institute of Vascular Medicine, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China. | MHC Key Laboratory of Biosafety, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC, Beijing, China. | Drug Clinical Trial Center, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China.",eng,Journal Article,20200309,United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,IM,NOTNLM,Chloroquine | Hydroxychloroquine | SARS-CoV-2,2020/03/10 06:00,2020/03/10 06:00,2020/03/10 06:00,2020/02/25 00:00 [received] | 2020/03/10 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/10 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/10 06:00 [medline],5801998 [pii] | 10.1093/cid/ciaa237 [doi],aheadofprint,Clin Infect Dis. 2020 Mar 9:ciaa237. doi: 10.1093/cid/ciaa237.,© The Author(s) 2020.

Methods: The basic characteristics, time and area distributions, clinical manifestations, epidemiological history and transmission mode of the COVID-19 cases associated with the department store exposure were analyzed. Results: A total of 40 COVID-19 cases were associated with the department store exposure, accounting for 75.47% of the total confirmed cases (53 cases) reported in Baodi district. The cases were mainly at the age of 60 years or older (35.00%) and farmers (40.00%). The main clinical manifestations included fever (95.00%), cough (35.00%), and diarrhea (15.00%). The proportion of confirmed severe cases was 32.50%. The incidence curve showed that the incidence peak occurred on 31 January, 2020. Among the 40 cases, 6(15.00%) were department store employees, 19(47.50%) were customers and 15(37.50%) were close contacts (secondary cases). The first case occurred on 21 January, 2020, this case was a department store employee who had a purchasing history at whole sale markets in other provinces and cities before the onset, and 3 employees were still on duty after symptom onsets. The median of the incubation period of customer cases was 6 days, and the median of the interval between onset and medical treatment of customer cases was 7 days. Conclusion: This was a cluster epidemic of COVID-19, which might be associated with the exposure in the department store. By now, the current prevention and control measures have achieved satisfied effects.","Wu, W S | Li, Y G | Wei, Z F | Zhou, P H | Lyu, L K | Zhang, G P | Zhao, Y | He, H Y | Li, X Y | Gao, L | Zhang, X M | Liu, H | Zhou, N | Guo, Y | Zhang, X M | Zhang, D | Liu, J | Zhang, Y",Wu WS | Li YG | Wei ZF | Zhou PH | Lyu LK | Zhang GP | Zhao Y | He HY | Li XY | Gao L | Zhang XM | Liu H | Zhou N | Guo Y | Zhang XM | Zhang D | Liu J | Zhang Y,"Epidemiology Working Group for COVID-19, Tianjin Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Tianjin 300011, China. | Baodi District Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Tianjin 301800, China. | Epidemiology Working Group for COVID-19, Tianjin Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Tianjin 300011, China. | Epidemiology Working Group for COVID-19, Tianjin Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Tianjin 300011, China. | Experimental Detection Group for COVID-19, Tianjin Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Tianjin 300011, China. | Epidemiology Working Group for COVID-19, Tianjin Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Tianjin 300011, China. | Epidemiology Working Group for COVID-19, Tianjin Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Tianjin 300011, China. | Epidemiology Working Group for COVID-19, Tianjin Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Tianjin 300011, China. | Experimental Detection Group for COVID-19, Tianjin Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Tianjin 300011, China. | Epidemiology Working Group for COVID-19, Tianjin Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Tianjin 300011, China. | Baodi District Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Tianjin 301800, China. | Epidemiology Working Group for COVID-19, Tianjin Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Tianjin 300011, China. | Epidemiology Working Group for COVID-19, Tianjin Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Tianjin 300011, China. | Epidemiology Working Group for COVID-19, Tianjin Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Tianjin 300011, China. | Epidemiology Working Group for COVID-19, Tianjin Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Tianjin 300011, China. | Epidemiology Working Group for COVID-19, Tianjin Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Tianjin 300011, China. | Epidemiology Working Group for COVID-19, Tianjin Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Tianjin 300011, China. | Epidemiology Working Group for COVID-19, Tianjin Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Tianjin 300011, China.",chi,English Abstract | Journal Article,20200305,China,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,8208604,IM,NOTNLM,COVID-19 | Cluster | Control | Epidemiology,2020/03/07 06:00,2020/03/07 06:00,2020/03/06 06:00,2020/03/06 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/07 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/07 06:00 [medline],10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200221-00139 [doi],aheadofprint,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi. 2020 Mar 5;41(4):489-493. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200221-00139.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of affected patients is limited. OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCIP. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective, single-center case series of the 138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from January 1 to January 28, 2020; final date of follow-up was February 3, 2020. EXPOSURES: Documented NCIP. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients were compared. Presumed hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster of health professionals or hospitalized patients in the same wards became infected and a possible source of infection could be tracked. RESULTS: Of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP, the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3%) were men. Hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for affected health professionals (40 [29%]) and hospitalized patients (17 [12.3%]). Common symptoms included fever (136 [98.6%]), fatigue (96 [69.6%]), and dry cough (82 [59.4%]). Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.8 × 109/L [interquartile range {IQR}, 0.6-1.1]) occurred in 97 patients (70.3%), prolonged prothrombin time (13.0 seconds [IQR, 12.3-13.7]) in 80 patients (58%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (261 U/L [IQR, 182-403]) in 55 patients (39.9%). Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Most patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]), and many received antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6%]; azithromycin, 25 [18.1%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9%]). Thirty-six patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1%]), arrhythmia (16 [44.4%]), and shock (11 [30.6%]). The median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ARDS was 8.0 days. Patients treated in the ICU (n = 36), compared with patients not treated in the ICU (n = 102), were older (median age, 66 years vs 51 years), were more likely to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2%] vs 38 [37.3%]), and were more likely to have dyspnea (23 [63.9%] vs 20 [19.6%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7%] vs 31 [30.4%]). Of the 36 cases in the ICU, 4 (11.1%) received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 (41.7%) received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2%) received invasive ventilation (4 were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). As of February 3, 47 patients (34.1%) were discharged and 6 died (overall mortality, 4.3%), but the remaining patients are still hospitalized. Among those discharged alive (n = 47), the median hospital stay was 10 days (IQR, 7.0-14.0). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this single-center case series of 138 hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP in Wuhan, China, presumed hospital-related transmission of 2019-nCoV was suspected in 41% of patients, 26% of patients received ICU care, and mortality was 4.3%.","Wang, Dawei | Hu, Bo | Hu, Chang | Zhu, Fangfang | Liu, Xing | Zhang, Jing | Wang, Binbin | Xiang, Hui | Cheng, Zhenshun | Xiong, Yong | Zhao, Yan | Li, Yirong | Wang, Xinghuan | Peng, Zhiyong",Wang D | Hu B | Hu C | Zhu F | Liu X | Zhang J | Wang B | Xiang H | Cheng Z | Xiong Y | Zhao Y | Li Y | Wang X | Peng Z,"Department of Critical Care Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China. | Department of Critical Care Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China. | Department of Critical Care Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China. | Department of Critical Care Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China. | Department of Critical Care Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China. | Department of Critical Care Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China. | Department of Critical Care Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China. | Department of Critical Care Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China. | Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China. | Department of Infectious Disease, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China. | Department of Emergency Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China. | Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China. | Department of Urology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China. | Department of Critical Care Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.",eng,Journal Article,20200207,,JAMA,JAMA,7501160,AIM | IM,,,2020/02/08 06:00,2020/02/08 06:00,2020/02/08 06:00,2020/08/07 00:00 [pmc-release] | 2020/02/08 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/02/08 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/02/08 06:00 [medline],2761044 [pii] | joi200019 [pii] | 10.1001/jama.2020.1585 [doi],aheadofprint,JAMA. 2020 Feb 7:e201585. doi: 10.1001/jama.2020.1585.,,,Conflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.,,,,JAMA. doi: 10.1001/jama.2020.1623 | JAMA. doi: 10.1001/jama.2020.0757 | JAMA. doi: 10.1001/jama.2020.1097 | JAMA. doi: 10.1001/jama.2020.1490,,PMC7042881,,,,,,,,,2020/08/07,,

In the past few decades, newly evolved Coronaviruses have posed a global threat to public health. The immune response is essential to control and eliminate CoV infections, however, maladjusted immune responses may result in immunopathology and impaired pulmonary gas exchange. Gaining a deeper understanding of the interaction between Coronaviruses and the innate immune systems of the hosts may shed light on the development and persistence of inflammation in the lungs and hopefully can reduce the risk of lung inflammation caused by CoVs.

On 30 January 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the COVID-19 epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, marked the third introduction of a highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic coronavirus into the human population in the twenty-first century. As of 1 March 2020, a total of 87,137 confirmed cases globally, 79,968 confirmed in China and 7169 outside of China, with 2977 deaths (3.4%) had been reported by WHO. Meanwhile, several independent research groups have identified that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to β-coronavirus, with highly identical genome to bat coronavirus, pointing to bat as the natural host. The novel coronavirus uses the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as that for SARS-CoV, and mainly spreads through the respiratory tract. Importantly, increasingly evidence showed sustained human-to-human transmission, along with many exported cases across the globe. The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients include fever, cough, fatigue and a small population of patients appeared gastrointestinal infection symptoms. The elderly and people with underlying diseases are susceptible to infection and prone to serious outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm. Currently, there are few specific antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed drugs are under urgent investigation. In this review, we summarized the latest research progress of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, and discussed the current treatment and scientific advancements to combat the epidemic novel coronavirus.","Guo, Yan-Rong | Cao, Qing-Dong | Hong, Zhong-Si | Tan, Yuan-Yang | Chen, Shou-Deng | Jin, Hong-Jun | Tan, Kai-Sen | Wang, De-Yun | Yan, Yan",Guo YR | Cao QD | Hong ZS | Tan YY | Chen SD | Jin HJ | Tan KS | Wang DY | Yan Y,"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging and Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Molecular Imaging, Zhuhai, 519000, Guangdong, China. | Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Zhuhai, 519000, Guangdong, China. | Center of Infectious Disease, the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Zhuhai, 519000, Guangdong, China. | Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging and Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Molecular Imaging, Zhuhai, 519000, Guangdong, China. | Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging and Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Molecular Imaging, Zhuhai, 519000, Guangdong, China. | Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging and Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Molecular Imaging, Zhuhai, 519000, Guangdong, China. | Department of Otolaryngology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, National University Health System, Singapore, 119228, Singapore. | Department of Otolaryngology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, National University Health System, Singapore, 119228, Singapore. entwdy@nus.edu.sg. | Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging and Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Molecular Imaging, Zhuhai, 519000, Guangdong, China. yanyan35@mail.sysu.edu.cn. | Center for Interventional Medicine, the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Zhuhai, 519000, Guangdong, China. yanyan35@mail.sysu.edu.cn.",eng,"Journal Article | Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't | Review",20200313,England,Mil Med Res,Military Medical Research,101643181,IM,NOTNLM,*Clinical characteristics | *Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) | *Origin | *SARS-CoV-2 | *Therapy | *Transmission,2020/03/15 06:00,2020/03/15 06:00,2020/03/15 06:00,2020/02/29 00:00 [received] | 2020/03/09 00:00 [accepted] | 2020/03/15 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/15 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/15 06:00 [medline],10.1186/s40779-020-00240-0 [pii] | 10.1186/s40779-020-00240-0 [doi],epublish,Mil Med Res. 2020 Mar 13;7(1):11. doi: 10.1186/s40779-020-00240-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, however, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine. Considering the relatively high identity of receptor-binding domain (RBD) in 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, it is urgent to assess the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS CoV antibodies with 2019-nCoV spike protein, which could have important implications for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against 2019-nCoV. Here, we report for the first time that a SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody, CR3022, could bind potently with 2019-nCoV RBD (KD of 6.3 nM). The epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site within 2019-nCoV RBD. These results suggest that CR3022 may have the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infections. Interestingly, some of the most potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.g. m396, CR3014) that target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, implying that the difference in the RBD of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV has a critical impact for the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies, and that it is still necessary to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that could bind specifically to 2019-nCoV RBD.","Tian, Xiaolong | Li, Cheng | Huang, Ailing | Xia, Shuai | Lu, Sicong | Shi, Zhengli | Lu, Lu | Jiang, Shibo | Yang, Zhenlin | Wu, Yanling | Ying, Tianlei",Tian X | Li C | Huang A | Xia S | Lu S | Shi Z | Lu L | Jiang S | Yang Z | Wu Y | Ying T,"MOE/NHC/CAMS Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China. | MOE/NHC/CAMS Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China. | MOE/NHC/CAMS Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China. | MOE/NHC/CAMS Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China. | MOE/NHC/CAMS Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China. | CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, People's Republic of China. | MOE/NHC/CAMS Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China. | MOE/NHC/CAMS Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China. | Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China. | MOE/NHC/CAMS Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China. | MOE/NHC/CAMS Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.",eng,Letter,,,Emerg Microbes Infect,Emerging microbes & infections,101594885,IM,NOTNLM,2019-nCoV | ACE2 | RBD | SARS-CoV | monoclonal antibody,2020/02/18 06:00,2020/03/17 06:00,2020/02/18 06:00,2020/02/18 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/02/18 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/17 06:00 [medline],1729069 [pii] | 10.1080/22221751.2020.1729069 [doi],ppublish,Emerg Microbes Infect. 2020 Dec;9(1):382-385. doi: 10.1080/22221751.2020.1729069.,,,,20200316,ORCID: 0000-0001-8089-163X | ORCID: 0000-0001-8283-7135 | ORCID: 0000-0002-9597-2843,"0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal) | 0 (Antibodies, Viral) | 0 (COVID-19) | 0 (Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus) | txid2697049 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2)",,"Amino Acid Sequence | Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology | Antibodies, Viral/*immunology | Betacoronavirus/*immunology | Coronavirus Infections | *Cross Reactions | Humans | Pneumonia, Viral | Protein Structure, Tertiary | SARS Virus/immunology | Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus/*immunology",PMC7048180,,,,,,,,,,,

Especially, the spike of case numbers in South Korea sparks pandemic worries. This virus is reported to spread mainly through personto- person contact via respiratory droplets generated by coughing and sneezing, or possibly through surface contaminated by people coughing or sneezing on them. More critically, there have been reports about the possibility of this virus to transmit even before a virus-carrying person to show symptoms. Therefore, a low-cost, easy-access protocol for early detection of this virus is desperately needed. Here, we have established a real-time reverse-transcription PCR (rtPCR)-based assay protocol composed of easy specimen self-collection from a subject via pharyngeal swab, Trizolbased RNA purification, and SYBR Green-based rtPCR. This protocol shows an accuracy and sensitivity limit of 1-10 virus particles as we tested with a known lentivirus. The cost for each sample is estimated to be less than 15 US dollars. Overall time it takes for an entire protocol is estimated to be less than 4 hours. We propose a cost-effective, quick-and-easy method for early detection of SARS-CoV-2 at any conventional Biosafety Level II laboratories that are equipped with a rtPCR machine. Our newly developed protocol should be helpful for a first-hand screening of the asymptomatic virus-carriers for further prevention of transmission and early intervention and treatment for the rapidly propagating virus.","Won, Joungha | Lee, Solji | Park, Myungsun | Kim, Tai Young | Park, Mingu Gordon | Choi, Byung Yoon | Kim, Dongwan | Chang, Hyeshik | Kim, V Narry | Lee, C Justin",Won J | Lee S | Park M | Kim TY | Park MG | Choi BY | Kim D | Chang H | Kim VN | Lee CJ,"Center for Cognition and Sociality, Cognitive Glioscience Group, Institute for Basic Science, Daejeon 34126, Korea. | Department of Biological Sciences, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon 34141, Korea. | Center for Cognition and Sociality, Cognitive Glioscience Group, Institute for Basic Science, Daejeon 34126, Korea. | Center for Cognition and Sociality, Cognitive Glioscience Group, Institute for Basic Science, Daejeon 34126, Korea. | Center for Cognition and Sociality, Cognitive Glioscience Group, Institute for Basic Science, Daejeon 34126, Korea. | Center for Cognition and Sociality, Cognitive Glioscience Group, Institute for Basic Science, Daejeon 34126, Korea. | KU-KIST Graduate School of Converging Science and Technology, Korea University, Seoul 02841, Korea. | Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam 13620, Korea. | Center for RNA Research, Institute for Basic Science, Seoul 08826, Korea. | School of Biological Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Korea. | Center for RNA Research, Institute for Basic Science, Seoul 08826, Korea. | School of Biological Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Korea. | Center for RNA Research, Institute for Basic Science, Seoul 08826, Korea. | School of Biological Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Korea. | Center for Cognition and Sociality, Cognitive Glioscience Group, Institute for Basic Science, Daejeon 34126, Korea.",eng,Journal Article,20200311,Korea (South),Exp Neurobiol,Experimental neurobiology,101278187,,NOTNLM,COVID-19 | Communicable diseases | Coronavirus | Diagnostic techniques and procedures | Emerging | Infectious disease | SARS virus,2020/03/12 06:00,2020/03/12 06:00,2020/03/12 06:00,2020/03/05 00:00 [received] | 2020/03/07 00:00 [revised] | 2020/03/07 00:00 [accepted] | 2020/03/12 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/12 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/12 06:00 [medline],en20009 [pii] | 10.5607/en20009 [doi],aheadofprint,Exp Neurobiol. 2020 Mar 11. doi: 10.5607/en20009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cases have been exported to other Chinese cities, as well as internationally, threatening to trigger a global outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the size of the epidemic in Wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China and forecast the extent of the domestic and global public health risks of epidemics, accounting for social and non-pharmaceutical prevention interventions. METHODS: We used data from Dec 31, 2019, to Jan 28, 2020, on the number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally (known days of symptom onset from Dec 25, 2019, to Jan 19, 2020) to infer the number of infections in Wuhan from Dec 1, 2019, to Jan 25, 2020. Cases exported domestically were then estimated. We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23-24, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database. Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI). FINDINGS: In our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·47-2·86) and that 75 815 individuals (95% CrI 37 304-130 330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·8-7·1). We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227-805), 113 (57-193), 98 (49-168), 111 (56-191), and 80 (40-139) infections from Wuhan, respectively. If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1-2 weeks. INTERPRETATION: Given that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks. Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately. Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions. Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.

OBJECTIVE: To report the initial experience in Singapore with the epidemiologic investigation of this outbreak, clinical features, and management. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Descriptive case series of the first 18 patients diagnosed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at 4 hospitals in Singapore from January 23 to February 3, 2020; final follow-up date was February 25, 2020. EXPOSURES: Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data were collected, including PCR cycle threshold values from nasopharyngeal swabs and viral shedding in blood, urine, and stool. Clinical course was summarized, including requirement for supplemental oxygen and intensive care and use of empirical treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir. RESULTS: Among the 18 hospitalized patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (median age, 47 years; 9 [50%] women), clinical presentation was an upper respiratory tract infection in 12 (67%), and viral shedding from the nasopharynx was prolonged for 7 days or longer among 15 (83%). Six individuals (33%) required supplemental oxygen; of these, 2 required intensive care. There were no deaths. Virus was detectable in the stool (4/8 [50%]) and blood (1/12 [8%]) by PCR but not in urine. Five individuals requiring supplemental oxygen were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir. For 3 of the 5 patients, fever resolved and supplemental oxygen requirement was reduced within 3 days, whereas 2 deteriorated with progressive respiratory failure. Four of the 5 patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir developed nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea, and 3 developed abnormal liver function test results. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among the first 18 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Singapore, clinical presentation was frequently a mild respiratory tract infection. Some patients required supplemental oxygen and had variable clinical outcomes following treatment with an antiretroviral agent.","Young, Barnaby Edward | Ong, Sean Wei Xiang | Kalimuddin, Shirin | Low, Jenny G | Tan, Seow Yen | Loh, Jiashen | Ng, Oon-Tek | Marimuthu, Kalisvar | Ang, Li Wei | Mak, Tze Minn | Lau, Sok Kiang | Anderson, Danielle E | Chan, Kian Sing | Tan, Thean Yen | Ng, Tong Yong | Cui, Lin | Said, Zubaidah | Kurupatham, Lalitha | Chen, Mark I-Cheng | Chan, Monica | Vasoo, Shawn | Wang, Lin-Fa | Tan, Boon Huan | Lin, Raymond Tzer Pin | Lee, Vernon Jian Ming | Leo, Yee-Sin | Lye, David Chien",Young BE | Ong SWX | Kalimuddin S | Low JG | Tan SY | Loh J | Ng OT | Marimuthu K | Ang LW | Mak TM | Lau SK | Anderson DE | Chan KS | Tan TY | Ng TY | Cui L | Said Z | Kurupatham L | Chen MI | Chan M | Vasoo S | Wang LF | Tan BH | Lin RTP | Lee VJM | Leo YS | Lye DC,"National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore. | Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore. | Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Singapore. | National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore. | Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore. | Singapore General Hospital, Singapore. | Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School, Singapore. | Singapore General Hospital, Singapore. | Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore. | Changi General Hospital, Singapore. | Sengkang General Hospital, Singapore. | National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore. | Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore. | Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Singapore. | National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore. | Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore. | Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, Singapore. | National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore. | National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore. | DSO National Laboratories, Singapore. | Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore. | Singapore General Hospital, Singapore. | Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore. | Changi General Hospital, Singapore. | Sengkang General Hospital, Singapore. | National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore. | Ministry of Health, Singapore. | Ministry of Health, Singapore. | National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore. | Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, Singapore. | National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore. | Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore. | National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore. | Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore. | Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore. | Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Singapore. | DSO National Laboratories, Singapore. | National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore. | Ministry of Health, Singapore. | Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, Singapore. | National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore. | Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore. | Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Singapore. | Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, Singapore. | Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, Singapore. | National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore. | Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore. | Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Singapore. | Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, Singapore.",eng,Journal Article,20200303,,JAMA,JAMA,7501160,AIM | IM,,,2020/03/04 06:00,2020/03/04 06:00,2020/03/04 06:00,2020/09/03 00:00 [pmc-release] | 2020/03/04 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/04 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/04 06:00 [medline],2762688 [pii] | joi200030 [pii] | 10.1001/jama.2020.3204 [doi],aheadofprint,JAMA. 2020 Mar 3:e203204. doi: 10.1001/jama.2020.3204.,,,"Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Young reported receiving personal fees from Sanofi and Roche.

This study aimed to clarify the characteristics of patients with refractory COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective single-center study, we included 155 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 1st to February 5th. The cases were divided into general and refractory COVID-19 groups according to the clinical efficacy after hospitalization, and the difference between groups were compared. RESULTS: Compared with general COVID-19 patients (45.2%), refractory patients had an older age, male sex, more underlying comorbidities, lower incidence of fever, higher levels of maximum temperature among fever cases, higher incidence of breath shortness and anorexia, severer disease assessment on admission, high levels of neutrophil, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein, lower levels of platelets and albumin, and higher incidence of bilateral pneumonia and pleural effusion (P<0.05). Refractory COVID-19 patients were more likely to receive oxygen, mechanical ventilation, expectorant, and adjunctive treatment including corticosteroid, antiviral drugs and immune enhancer (P<0.05). After adjustment, those with refractory COVID-19 were also more likely to have a male sex and manifestations of anorexia and fever on admission, and receive oxygen, expectorant and adjunctive agents (P<0.05) when considering the factors of disease severity on admission, mechanical ventilation, and ICU transfer. CONCLUSION: Nearly 50% COVID-19 patients could not reach obvious clinical and radiological remission within 10 days after hospitalization. The patients with male sex, anorexia and no fever on admission predicted poor efficacy.","Mo, Pingzheng | Xing, Yuanyuan | Xiao, Yu | Deng, Liping | Zhao, Qiu | Wang, Hongling | Xiong, Yong | Cheng, Zhenshun | Gao, Shicheng | Liang, Ke | Luo, Mingqi | Chen, Tielong | Song, Shihui | Ma, Zhiyong | Chen, Xiaoping | Zheng, Ruiying | Cao, Qian | Wang, Fan | Zhang, Yongxi",Mo P | Xing Y | Xiao Y | Deng L | Zhao Q | Wang H | Xiong Y | Cheng Z | Gao S | Liang K | Luo M | Chen T | Song S | Ma Z | Chen X | Zheng R | Cao Q | Wang F | Zhang Y,"Department of Infectious Disease, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China. | Department of Biological Repositories, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China. | Department of Biological Repositories, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China. | Department of Infectious Disease, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China. | Department of Gastroenterology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China. | Department of Gastroenterology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China. | Department of Infectious Disease, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China. | Department of Respiratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China. | Department of Infectious Disease, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China. | Department of Infectious Disease, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China. | Department of Infectious Disease, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China. | Department of Infectious Disease, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China. | Department of Infectious Disease, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China. | Department of Infectious Disease, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China. | Department of Infectious Disease, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China. | Department of Infectious Disease, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China. | Department of Infectious Disease, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China. | Department of Gastroenterology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China. | Department of Infectious Disease, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.",eng,Journal Article,20200316,United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,IM,NOTNLM,COVID-19 | SARS-CoV-2 | clinical efficacy | predictors,2020/03/17 06:00,2020/03/17 06:00,2020/03/17 06:00,2020/02/11 00:00 [received] | 2020/03/17 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/17 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/17 06:00 [medline],5805508 [pii] | 10.1093/cid/ciaa270 [doi],aheadofprint,Clin Infect Dis. 2020 Mar 16:ciaa270. doi: 10.1093/cid/ciaa270.,"© The Author(s) 2020.

Among the confirmed cases, 1527 were severe cases, 171 had recovered and been discharged at home, and 213 died. And among these cases, a total of 28 children aged from 1 month to 17 years have been reported in China. For standardizing prevention and management of 2019-nCoV infections in children, we called up an experts' committee to formulate this experts' consensus statement. This statement is based on the Novel Coronavirus Infection Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Standards (the fourth edition) (National Health Committee) and other previous diagnosis and treatment strategies for pediatric virus infections. The present consensus statement summarizes current strategies on diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of 2019-nCoV infection in children.","Shen, Kunling | Yang, Yonghong | Wang, Tianyou | Zhao, Dongchi | Jiang, Yi | Jin, Runming | Zheng, Yuejie | Xu, Baoping | Xie, Zhengde | Lin, Likai | Shang, Yunxiao | Lu, Xiaoxia | Shu, Sainan | Bai, Yan | Deng, Jikui | Lu, Min | Ye, Leping | Wang, Xuefeng | Wang, Yongyan | Gao, Liwei",Shen K | Yang Y | Wang T | Zhao D | Jiang Y | Jin R | Zheng Y | Xu B | Xie Z | Lin L | Shang Y | Lu X | Shu S | Bai Y | Deng J | Lu M | Ye L | Wang X | Wang Y | Gao L,"Department of Respiratory Medicine, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China. kunlingshen1717@163.com. | Beijing Pediatric Research Institute, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China. yyh628628@sina.com. | Center of Hematologic Oncology, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China. | Department of Pediatrics, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. zhao_wh2004@hotmail.com. | Department of Pediatrics, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. | Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. | Department of Respiratory Medicine, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen, China. | Department of Respiratory Medicine, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China. | Beijing Pediatric Research Institute, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China. | Hospital Management Institute of Wuhan University, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. | Department of Pediatric Respiratory, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China. | Department of Respiratory Medicine, Wuhan Children's Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. | Department of Pediatrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. | Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. | Department of Infectious Disease, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen, China. | Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children's Hospital of Shanghai, Shanghai, China. | Department of Pediatrics, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China. | Department of Pediatrics, Affiliated Hospital of Liaoning University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shenyang, China. | Institute of Basic Research in Clinical Medicine, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China. | Department of Respiratory Medicine, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.",eng,Journal Article,20200207,Switzerland,World J Pediatr,World journal of pediatrics : WJP,101278599,IM,,,2020/02/09 06:00,2020/02/09 06:00,2020/02/09 06:00,2020/01/29 00:00 [received] | 2020/01/30 00:00 [accepted] | 2020/02/09 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/02/09 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/02/09 06:00 [medline],10.1007/s12519-020-00343-7 [pii] | 10.1007/s12519-020-00343-7 [doi],aheadofprint,World J Pediatr. 2020 Feb 7. doi: 10.1007/s12519-020-00343-7.,,,,,,,,,,,"China National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Diseases | National Center for Children’s Health, Beijing, China | Group of Respirology, Chinese Pediatric Society, Chinese Medical Association | Chinese Medical Doctor Association Committee on Respirology Pediatrics | China Medicine Education Association Committee on Pediatrics | Chinese Research Hospital Association Committee on Pediatrics | Chinese Non-government Medical Institutions Association Committee on Pediatrics | China Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Committee on Children’s Health and Medicine Research | China News of Drug Information Association, Committee on Children’s Safety Medication | Global Pediatric Pulmonology Alliance",,,,,,,,,

In addition, novel pathogens including zoonotic coronaviruses like the agents causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) are still being identified. Patients with severe RVIs requiring ICU care present typically with hypoxemic respiratory failure. Oseltamivir is the most widely used neuraminidase inhibitor for treatment of influenza; data suggest that early use is associated with reduced mortality in critically ill patients with influenza. At present, there are no antiviral therapies of proven efficacy for other severe RVIs. Several adjunctive pharmacologic interventions have been studied for their immunomodulatory effects, including macrolides, corticosteroids, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, sirolimus, statins, anti-influenza immune plasma, and vitamin C, but none is recommended at present in severe RVIs. Evidence-based supportive care is the mainstay for management of severe respiratory viral infection. Non-invasive ventilation in patients with severe RVI causing acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and pneumonia is associated with a high likelihood of transition to invasive ventilation. Limited existing knowledge highlights the need for data regarding supportive care and adjunctive pharmacologic therapy that is specific for critically ill patients with severe RVI. There is a need for more pragmatic and efficient designs to test different therapeutics both individually and in combination.","Arabi, Yaseen M | Fowler, Robert | Hayden, Frederick G",Arabi YM | Fowler R | Hayden FG,"College of Medicine, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

This virus is responsible for the ongoing outbreak that causes severe respiratory illness and pneumonia-like infection in humans. Due to the increasing number of cases in China and outside China, the WHO declared coronavirus as a global health emergency. Nearly 35,000 cases were reported and at least 24 other countries or territories have reported coronavirus cases as early on as February. Inter-human transmission was reported in a few countries, including the United States. Neither an effective anti-viral nor a vaccine is currently available to treat this infection. As the virus is a newly emerging pathogen, many questions remain unanswered regarding the virus's reservoirs, pathogenesis, transmissibility, and much more is unknown. The collaborative efforts of researchers are needed to fill the knowledge gaps about this new virus, to develop the proper diagnostic tools, and effective treatment to combat this infection. Recent advancements in plant biotechnology proved that plants have the ability to produce vaccines or biopharmaceuticals rapidly in a short time. In this review, the outbreak of 2019-nCoV in China, the need for rapid vaccine development, and the potential of a plant system for biopharmaceutical development are discussed.","Shanmugaraj, Balamurugan | Malla, Ashwini | Phoolcharoen, Waranyoo",Shanmugaraj B | Malla A | Phoolcharoen W,"Research unit for Plant-produced Pharmaceuticals, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand. | Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Botany, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand. | Research unit for Plant-produced Pharmaceuticals, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand. | Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Botany, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand. | Research unit for Plant-produced Pharmaceuticals, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand. | Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Botany, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.",eng,Journal Article | Review,20200222,Switzerland,Pathogens,"Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",101596317,,NOTNLM,biopharmaceuticals | coronavirus | emerging threat | infectious diseases | plant system | transient expression | viruses | zoonoses,2020/02/27 06:00,2020/02/27 06:01,2020/02/27 06:00,2020/02/11 00:00 [received] | 2020/02/19 00:00 [revised] | 2020/02/21 00:00 [accepted] | 2020/02/27 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/02/27 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/02/27 06:01 [medline],pathogens9020148 [pii] | 10.3390/pathogens9020148 [doi],epublish,Pathogens. 2020 Feb 22;9(2):E148. doi: 10.3390/pathogens9020148.,,,,,ORCID: 0000-0001-5958-7406,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aims to investigate its epidemiologic history, and analyze the clinical characteristics, treatment regimens, and prognosis of patients infected with 2019-nCoV during this outbreak. METHODS: Clinical data from 137 2019-nCoV-infected patients admitted to the respiratory departments of the respiratory departments of nine tertiary hospitals in Hubei province from December 30, 2019 to January 24, 2020 were retrospectively collected, including general status, clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, imaging characteristics, and treatment regimens. RESULTS: None of the 137 patients (61 males, 76 females, aged 20-83 years, median age 57 years) had a definite history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Major initial symptoms included fever (112/137, 81.8%), coughing (66/137, 48.2%), and muscle pain or fatigue (44/137, 32.1%), with other, less typical initial symptoms observed at low frequency, including heart palpitations, diarrhea, and headache. Nearly 80% of the patients had normal or decreased white blood cell counts, and 72.3% (99/137) had lymphocytopenia. Lung involvement was present in all cases, with most chest computed tomography scans showing lesions in multiple lung lobes, some of which were dense; ground-glass opacity co-existed with consolidation shadows or cord-like shadows. Given the lack of effective drugs, treatment focused on symptomatic and respiratory support. Immunoglobulin G was delivered to some critically ill patients according to their conditions. Systemic corticosteroid treatment did not show significant benefits. Notably, early respiratory support facilitated disease recovery and improved prognosis. The risk of death was primarily associated with age, underlying chronic diseases, and median interval from the appearance of initial symptoms to dyspnea. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia present with fever as the first symptom, and most of them still showed typical manifestations of viral pneumonia on chest imaging. Middle-aged and elderly patients with underlying comorbidities are susceptible to respiratory failure and may have a poorer prognosis.","Liu, Kui | Fang, Yuan-Yuan | Deng, Yan | Liu, Wei | Wang, Mei-Fang | Ma, Jing-Ping | Xiao, Wei | Wang, Ying-Nan | Zhong, Min-Hua | Li, Cheng-Hong | Li, Guang-Cai | Liu, Hui-Guo",Liu K | Fang YY | Deng Y | Liu W | Wang MF | Ma JP | Xiao W | Wang YN | Zhong MH | Li CH | Li GC | Liu HG,"Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430030, China. | Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430030, China. | Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430030, China. | Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430030, China. | Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Taihe Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Hubei University of Medicine, Shiyan, Hubei 442000, China. | Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Jingzhou Central Hospital, Jingzhou, Hubei 434020, China. | Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The First People's Hospital of Jingzhou, Jingzhou, Hubei 434000, China. | Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The People's Hospital of China Three Gorges University, The First People's Hospital of Yichang, Yichang, Hubei 443000, China. | Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Xiaogan Hospital Affiliated to Wuhan University of Science and Technology, The Central Hospital of Xiaogan, Xiaogan, Hubei 432100, China. | Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The Sixth Hospital of Wuhan, Jianghan University, Wuhan, Hubei 430015, China. | Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The Central Hospital of Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonmous Prefecture, Enshi Clinical College, Wuhan University, Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Hubei 445000, China. | Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430030, China.",eng,Journal Article,20200207,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,IM,,,2020/02/12 06:00,2020/02/12 06:00,2020/02/12 06:00,2020/02/12 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/02/12 06:00 [medline] | 2020/02/12 06:00 [entrez],10.1097/CM9.0000000000000744 [doi],aheadofprint,Chin Med J (Engl). 2020 Feb 7. doi: 10.1097/CM9.0000000000000744.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identification of the causative viral pathogens of respiratory tract viral infections is important to select an appropriate treatment, save people's lives, stop the epidemics, and avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics. Conventional diagnostic tests, such as the assays for rapid detection of antiviral antibodies or viral antigens, are widely used in many clinical laboratories. With the development of modern technologies, new diagnostic strategies, including multiplex nucleic acid amplification and microarray-based assays, are emerging. This review summarizes currently available and novel emerging diagnostic methods for the detection of common respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus, human respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, human adenovirus, and human rhinovirus. Multiplex assays for simultaneous detection of multiple respiratory viruses are also described. It is anticipated that such data will assist researchers and clinicians to develop appropriate diagnostic strategies for timely and effective detection of respiratory virus infections.","Zhang, Naru | Wang, Lili | Deng, Xiaoqian | Liang, Ruiying | Su, Meng | He, Chen | Hu, Lanfang | Su, Yudan | Ren, Jing | Yu, Fei | Du, Lanying | Jiang, Shibo",Zhang N | Wang L | Deng X | Liang R | Su M | He C | Hu L | Su Y | Ren J | Yu F | Du L | Jiang S,"Department of Clinical Medicine, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University City College, Hangzhou, China. | State Key Laboratory of North China Crop Improvement and Regulation, Research Center of Chinese Jujube, Hebei Agricultural University, Baoding, China. | State Key Laboratory of North China Crop Improvement and Regulation, College of Life and Science, Hebei Agricultural University, Baoding, China. | State Key Laboratory of North China Crop Improvement and Regulation, College of Life and Science, Hebei Agricultural University, Baoding, China. | State Key Laboratory of North China Crop Improvement and Regulation, College of Life and Science, Hebei Agricultural University, Baoding, China. | State Key Laboratory of North China Crop Improvement and Regulation, College of Life and Science, Hebei Agricultural University, Baoding, China. | State Key Laboratory of North China Crop Improvement and Regulation, College of Life and Science, Hebei Agricultural University, Baoding, China. | State Key Laboratory of North China Crop Improvement and Regulation, College of Life and Science, Hebei Agricultural University, Baoding, China. | State Key Laboratory of North China Crop Improvement and Regulation, College of Life and Science, Hebei Agricultural University, Baoding, China. | State Key Laboratory of North China Crop Improvement and Regulation, College of Life and Science, Hebei Agricultural University, Baoding, China. | Lindsley F.

The characteristics including high contagiousness, herd susceptibility and clinical phenotype diversity, made a serious influence on people's daily life and rountine therapy for other diseases. Breast dieases are clinical common diseases. In the central epidemic area of COVID-19, Hubei province, especially Wuhan, the clinical specialists of breast diseases should consider all of the following factors comprehensively: the prevention of COVID-19, the diagnosis and treatment of breast diseases and the accessibility of medical resources. Besides, we should select the appropriate therapy and optimize treatment process so as to prevent the propagation and cross infection of COVID-19 as well as manage the breast diseases without delay. Therefore, we carried out some management proposals of the patients with breast diseases in the central epidemic area during the epidemic of COVID-19 on the basis of conventional treatment guidelines and clinical experiences. The suggestions and corrections from colleagues will be welcomed.","Zhao, L | Zhang, L | Liu, J W | Yang, Z F | Shen, W Z | Li, X R",Zhao L | Zhang L | Liu JW | Yang ZF | Shen WZ | Li XR,"Department of Thyroid and Breast Surgery of Tongji Hospital Affiliated with Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science &Technology, Wuhan 430030, China. | Department of Thyroid and Breast Surgery of Tongji Hospital Affiliated with Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science &Technology, Wuhan 430030, China. | Department of Thyroid and Breast Surgery of Tongji Hospital Affiliated with Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science &Technology, Wuhan 430030, China. | Department of Thyroid and Breast Surgery of Tongji Hospital Affiliated with Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science &Technology, Wuhan 430030, China. | Department of Thyroid and Breast Surgery of Tongji Hospital Affiliated with Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science &Technology, Wuhan 430030, China. | Department of Thyroid and Breast Surgery of Tongji Hospital Affiliated with Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science &Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.",chi,English Abstract | Journal Article,20200225,China,Zhonghua Wai Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua wai ke za zhi [Chinese journal of surgery],0153611,IM,NOTNLM,Breast diseases | COVID-19 | Coronavirus infected diseases | Novel coronavirus pneumonia,2020/02/26 06:00,2020/02/26 06:00,2020/02/26 06:00,2020/02/26 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/02/26 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/02/26 06:00 [medline],10.3760/cma.j.cn112139-20200221-00116 [doi],aheadofprint,Zhonghua Wai Ke Za Zhi. 2020 Feb 25;58(0):E005. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112139-20200221-00116.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On January 7, 2020, Chinese health officials confirmed that a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was associated with this initial cluster (1). As of February 4, 2020, a total of 20,471 confirmed cases, including 2,788 (13.6%) with severe illness,* and 425 deaths (2.1%) had been reported by the National Health Commission of China (2). Cases have also been reported in 26 locations outside of mainland China, including documentation of some person-to-person transmission and one death (2). As of February 4, 11 cases had been reported in the United States. On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General declared that the 2019-nCoV outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.(†) On January 31, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary declared a U.S. public health emergency to respond to 2019-nCoV.(§) Also on January 31, the president of the United States signed a ""Proclamation on Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirus,"" which limits entry into the United States of persons who traveled to mainland China to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents and their families (3). CDC, multiple other federal agencies, state and local health departments, and other partners are implementing aggressive measures to slow transmission of 2019-nCoV in the United States (4,5). These measures require the identification of cases and their contacts in the United States and the appropriate assessment and care of travelers arriving from mainland China to the United States. These measures are being implemented in anticipation of additional 2019-nCoV cases in the United States. Although these measures might not prevent the eventual establishment of ongoing, widespread transmission of the virus in the United States, they are being implemented to 1) slow the spread of illness; 2) provide time to better prepare health care systems and the general public to be ready if widespread transmission with substantial associated illness occurs; and 3) better characterize 2019-nCoV infection to guide public health recommendations and the development of medical countermeasures including diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. Public health authorities are monitoring the situation closely. As more is learned about this novel virus and this outbreak, CDC will rapidly incorporate new knowledge into guidance for action by CDC and state and local health departments.","Patel, Anita | Jernigan, Daniel B",Patel A | Jernigan DB,"Incident Manager, 2019-nCoV CDC Response, CDC. | Incident Manager, 2019-nCoV CDC Response, CDC.",eng,Journal Article,20200207,,MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,MMWR.

The virus belongs to the β genus Coronavirus in the family Corornaviridae, and is closely related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing severe symptoms of pneumonia. The virus is transmitted through droplets, close contact, and other means, and patients in the incubation period could potentially transmit the virus to other persons. According to current observations, 2019-nCoV is weaker than SARS in pathogenesis, but has stronger transmission competence; it's mechanism of cross-species spread might be related with angiotensin-converting enzyme Ⅱ (ACE2), which is consistent with the receptor SARS-CoV. After the outbreak of this disease, Chinese scientists invested a lot of energy to carry out research by developing rapid diagnostic reagents, identifying the characters of the pathogen, screening out clinical drugs that may inhibit the virus, and are rapidly developing vaccines. The emergence of 2019-nCoV reminds us once again of the importance of establishing a systematic coronavirus surveillance network. It also poses new challenges to prevention and control of the emerging epidemic and rapidly responses on scientific research.","Tian, H Y",Tian HY,"State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science/College of Global Change and Earth System Science/Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, China.",chi,English Abstract | Journal Article,20200203,China,Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi [Chinese journal of preventive medicine],7904962,IM,NOTNLM,2019-nCoV | Coronavirus | Public health,2020/02/06 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/02/06 06:00 [medline],10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-9624.2020.0001 [doi],aheadofprint,Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2020 Feb 3;54(0):E001. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-9624.2020.0001.,,2018QNRC001/Young Elite Scientist Sponsorship Program by CAST/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The persistence and clearance of viral RNA from different specimens of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remain unclear. This study analyzed the clearance time and factors influencing 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RNA in different samples from patients with COVID-19, providing further evidence to improve the management of patients during convalescence. METHODS: The clinical data and laboratory test results of convalescent patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to from January 20, 2020 to February 10, 2020 were collected retrospectively. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for patients' oropharyngeal swab, stool, urine, and serum samples were collected and analyzed. Convalescent patients refer to recovered non-febrile patients without respiratory symptoms who had two successive (minimum 24 h sampling interval) negative RT-PCR results for viral RNA from oropharyngeal swabs. The effects of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+ T lymphocytes, inflammatory indicators, and glucocorticoid treatment on viral nucleic acid clearance were analyzed. RESULTS: In the 292 confirmed cases, 66 patients recovered after treatment and were included in our study. In total, 28 (42.4%) women and 38 men (57.6%) with a median age of 44.0 (34.0-62.0) years were analyzed. After in-hospital treatment, patients' inflammatory indicators decreased with improved clinical condition. The median time from the onset of symptoms to first negative RT-PCR results for oropharyngeal swabs in convalescent patients was 9.5 (6.0-11.0) days. By February 10, 2020, 11 convalescent patients (16.7%) still tested positive for viral RNA from stool specimens and the other 55 patients' stool specimens were negative for 2019-nCoV following a median duration of 11.0 (9.0-16.0) days after symptom onset. Among these 55 patients, 43 had a longer duration until stool specimens were negative for viral RNA than for throat swabs, with a median delay of 2.0 (1.0-4.0) days. Results for only four (6.9%) urine samples were positive for viral nucleic acid out of 58 cases; viral RNA was still present in three patients' urine specimens after throat swabs were negative. Using a multiple linear regression model (F = 2.669, P = 0.044, and adjusted R = 0.122), the analysis showed that the CD4+ T lymphocyte count may help predict the duration of viral RNA detection in patients' stools (t = -2.699, P = 0.010). The duration of viral RNA detection from oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (15 days vs. 8.0 days, respectively; t = 2.550, P = 0.013) and the duration of viral RNA detection in fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (20 days vs. 11 days, respectively; t = 4.631, P < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in inflammatory indicators between patients with positive fecal viral RNA test results and those with negative results (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In brief, as the clearance of viral RNA in patients' stools was delayed compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs, it is important to identify viral RNA in feces during convalescence. Because of the delayed clearance of viral RNA in the glucocorticoid treatment group, glucocorticoids are not recommended in the treatment of COVID-19, especially for mild disease. The duration of RNA detection may relate to host cell immunity.","Ling, Yun | Xu, Shui-Bao | Lin, Yi-Xiao | Tian, Di | Zhu, Zhao-Qin | Dai, Fa-Hui | Wu, Fan | Song, Zhi-Gang | Huang, Wei | Chen, Jun | Hu, Bi-Jie | Wang, Sheng | Mao, En-Qiang | Zhu, Lei | Zhang, Wen-Hong | Lu, Hong-Zhou",Ling Y | Xu SB | Lin YX | Tian D | Zhu ZQ | Dai FH | Wu F | Song ZG | Huang W | Chen J | Hu BJ | Wang S | Mao EQ | Zhu L | Zhang WH | Lu HZ,"Department of Infectious Disease, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Shanghai 201508, China. | Department of Infectious Disease and Immunology, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Shanghai 201508, China. | Department of Hepatology, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Shanghai 201508, China. | Department of Infectious Disease, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Shanghai 201508, China. | Department of Infectious Disease, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Shanghai 201508, China. | Department of Infectious Disease, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Shanghai 201508, China. | Department of Infectious Disease, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Shanghai 201508, China. | Department of Infectious Disease, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Shanghai 201508, China. | Department of Infectious Disease, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Shanghai 201508, China. | Department of Infectious Disease and Immunology, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Shanghai 201508, China. | Department of Infectious Disease, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China. | Department of Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai 200072, China. | Department of Emergency, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China. | Department of Pulmonology, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China. | Department of Infectious Disease, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200041, China. | Department of Infectious Disease, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Shanghai 201508, China. | Department of Infectious Disease and Immunology, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Shanghai 201508, China. | Department of Infectious Disease, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200041, China. | Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China.",eng,Journal Article,20200228,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,IM,,,2020/03/03 06:00,2020/03/03 06:00,2020/03/03 06:00,2020/03/03 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/03 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/03 06:00 [medline],10.1097/CM9.0000000000000774 [doi],aheadofprint,Chin Med J (Engl). 2020 Feb 28. doi: 10.1097/CM9.0000000000000774.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce. We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. METHODS: In this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected. Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation. FINDINGS: Of 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included. The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever. 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3-11) days for non-survivors. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively. Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax. 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation. Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients. INTERPRETATION: The mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable. The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1-2 weeks after ICU admission. Older patients (>65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death. The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.

However, drug screening using live 2019-nCoV requires high-level biosafety facilities, which imposes an obstacle for those without such facilities or 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). This study aims to repurpose the clinically approved drugs for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a 2019-nCoV related coronavirus model. METHODS: A 2019-nCoV related pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V/pangolin/2017/ Guangxi was described. Whether GX_P2X uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the cell receptor was investigated by using small interfering RNA (siRNA) -mediated silencing of ACE2. The pangolin coronavirus model was used to identify drug candidates for treating 2019-nCoV infection. Two libraries of 2406 clinically approved drugs were screened for their ability to inhibit cytopathic effects on Vero E6 cells by GX_P2X infection. The antiviral activities and antiviral mechanisms of potential drugs were further investigated. Viral yields of RNAs and infectious particles were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and plaque assay, respectively. RESULTS: The spike protein of coronavirus GX_P2V shares 92.2% amino acid identity with that of 2019-nCoV isolate Wuhan-hu-1, and uses ACE2 as the receptor for infection just like 2019-nCoV. Three drugs-cepharanthine (CEP), selamectin and mefloquine hydrochloride exhibited complete inhibition of cytopathic effects in cell culture at 10 μmol/L. CEP demonstrated the most potent inhibition of GX_P2V infection, with a concentration for 50% of maximal effect [EC50] of 0.98 μmol/L. The viral RNA yield in cells treated with 10 μmol/L CEP was 15,393-fold lower than in cells without CEP treatment ([6.48 ± 0.02] × 10vs. 1.00 ± 0.12, t = 150.38, P < 0.001) at 72 h post-infection (p.i.). Plaque assays found no production of live viruses in media containing 10 μmol/L CEP at 48 h p.i. Furthermore, we found CEP has potent antiviral activities against both viral entry (1.00 ± 0.37 vs. 0.46 ± 0.12, t = 2.42, P < 0.05) and viral replication (1.00 ± 0.43 vs. [6.18 ± 0.95] × 10, t = 3.98, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V is a workable model for 2019-nCoV research. CEP, selamectin and mefloquine hydrochloride are potential drugs for treating 2019-nCoV infection. Our results strongly suggest that CEP is a wide-spectrum inhibitor of pan-betacoronavirus, and clinical trial of CEP for treatment of 2019-nCoV infection is warranted.","Fan, Hua-Hao | Wang, Li-Qin | Liu, Wen-Li | An, Xiao-Ping | Liu, Zhen-Dong | He, Xiao-Qi | Song, Li-Hua | Tong, Yi-Gang",Fan HH | Wang LQ | Liu WL | An XP | Liu ZD | He XQ | Song LH | Tong YG,"Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Soft Matter Science and Engineering, College of Life Science and Technology, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing 100029, China.",eng,Journal Article,20200306,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,IM,,,2020/03/10 06:00,2020/03/10 06:00,2020/03/10 06:00,2020/03/10 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/10 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/10 06:00 [medline],10.1097/CM9.0000000000000797 [doi],aheadofprint,Chin Med J (Engl). 2020 Mar 6. doi: 10.1097/CM9.0000000000000797.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genetic sequencing of isolates obtained from patients with pneumonia identified a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as the etiology (1). As of February 4, 2020, approximately 20,000 confirmed cases had been identified in China and an additional 159 confirmed cases in 23 other countries, including 11 in the United States (2,3). On January 17, CDC and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection began health screenings at U.S. airports to identify ill travelers returning from Wuhan City (4). CDC activated its Emergency Operations Center on January 21 and formalized a process for inquiries regarding persons suspected of having 2019-nCoV infection (2). As of January 31, 2020, CDC had responded to clinical inquiries from public health officials and health care providers to assist in evaluating approximately 650 persons thought to be at risk for 2019-nCoV infection. Guided by CDC criteria for the evaluation of persons under investigation (PUIs) (5), 210 symptomatic persons were tested for 2019-nCoV; among these persons, 148 (70%) had travel-related risk only, 42 (20%) had close contact with an ill laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV patient or PUI, and 18 (9%) had both travel- and contact-related risks. Eleven of these persons had laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Recognizing persons at risk for 2019-nCoV is critical to identifying cases and preventing further transmission. Health care providers should remain vigilant and adhere to recommended infection prevention and control practices when evaluating patients for possible 2019-nCoV infection (6). Providers should consult with their local and state health departments when assessing not only ill travelers from 2019-nCoV-affected countries but also ill persons who have been in close contact with patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection in the United States.","Bajema, Kristina L | Oster, Alexandra M | McGovern, Olivia L | Lindstrom, Stephen | Stenger, Mark R | Anderson, Tara C | Isenhour, Cheryl | Clarke, Kevin R | Evans, Mary E | Chu, Victoria T | Biggs, Holly M | Kirking, Hannah L | Gerber, Susan I | Hall, Aron J | Fry, Alicia M | Oliver, Sara E",Bajema KL | Oster AM | McGovern OL | Lindstrom S | Stenger MR | Anderson TC | Isenhour C | Clarke KR | Evans ME | Chu VT | Biggs HM | Kirking HL | Gerber SI | Hall AJ | Fry AM | Oliver SE,,eng,Journal Article,20200214,,MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,MMWR.

However, the molecular mechanism behind ADE is still elusive. Coronavirus spike protein mediates viral entry into cells by first binding to a receptor on the host cell surface and then fusing viral and host membranes. In this study, we investigated how a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (MAb), which targets the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus spike, mediates viral entry using pseudovirus entry and biochemical assays. Our results showed that MAb binds to the virus surface spike, allowing it to undergo conformational changes and become prone to proteolytic activation. Meanwhile, MAb binds to cell surface IgG Fc receptor, guiding viral entry through canonical viral-receptor-dependent pathways. Our data suggest that the antibody/Fc-receptor complex functionally mimics viral receptor in mediating viral entry. Moreover, we characterized MAb dosages in viral-receptor-dependent, Fc-receptor-dependent, and both-receptors-dependent viral entry pathways, delineating guidelines on MAb usages in treating viral infections. Our study reveals a novel molecular mechanism for antibody-enhanced viral entry and can guide future vaccination and antiviral strategies.IMPORTANCE Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral entry has been observed for many viruses. It was shown that antibodies target one serotype of viruses but only subneutralize another, leading to ADE of the latter viruses. Here we identify a novel mechanism for ADE: a neutralizing antibody binds to the surface spike protein of coronaviruses like a viral receptor, triggers a conformational change of the spike, and mediates viral entry into IgG Fc receptor-expressing cells through canonical viral-receptor-dependent pathways. We further evaluated how antibody dosages impacted viral entry into cells expressing viral receptor, Fc receptor, or both receptors. This study reveals complex roles of antibodies in viral entry and can guide future vaccine design and antibody-based drug therapy.","Wang, Fu-Sheng | Zhang, Chao | Wan, Yushun | Shang, Jian | Sun, Shihui | Tai, Wanbo | Chen, Jing | Geng, Qibin | He, Lei | Chen, Yuehong | Wu, Jianming | Shi, Zhengli | Zhou, Yusen | Du, Lanying | Li, Fang",Wang FS | Zhang C | Wan Y | Shang J | Sun S | Tai W | Chen J | Geng Q | He L | Chen Y | Wu J | Shi Z | Zhou Y | Du L | Li F,"Treatment and Research Center for Infectious Diseases, The Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Beijing 100039, China.

As such, we developed this consensus recommendations on all those high-risk treatments, based on the current evidence as well as the resource limitation in some areas, with the aim to reduce the nosocomial transmission and optimize the treatment for the COVID-19 pneumonia patients. Those recommendations include: (1) Standard prevention and protection, and patient isolation; (2) Patient wearing mask during HFNC treatment; (3) Using dual limb ventilator with filters placed at the ventilator outlets, or using heat-moisture exchanger (HME) instead of heated humidification in single limb ventilator with HME placed between exhalation port and mask; avoid using mask with exhalation port on the mask; (4) Placing filter between resuscitator and mask or artificial airway; (5) For spontaneous breathing patients, placing mask for patients during bronchoscopy examination; for patients receiving noninvasive ventilation, using the special mask with bronchoscopy port to perform bronchoscopy; (6) Using sedation and paralytics during intubation, cuff pressure should be maintained between 25-30 cmH(2)O; (7) In-line suction catheter is recommended and it can be used for one week; (8) Dual-limb heated wire circuits are recommended and only changed with visible soiled; (9. For patients who need breathing support during transportation, placing an HME between ventilator and patient; (10) PSV is recommended for implementing spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), avoid using T-piece to do SBT. When tracheotomy patients are weaned from ventilator, HME should be used, avoid using T-piece or tracheostomy mask. (11) Avoid unnecessary bronchial hygiene therapy; (12) For patients who need aerosol therapy, dry powder inhaler metered dose inhaler with spacer is recommended for spontaneous breathing patients; while vibrating mesh nebulizer is recommended for ventilated patients and additional filter is recommended to be placed at the expiratory port of ventilation during nebulization.",,,,chi,English Abstract | Journal Article,20200220,China,Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi,Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,8712226,IM,NOTNLM,COVID-19 | Nosocomial infection | Protective measures | Respiratory therapy | Severe and critical infections,2020/02/23 06:00,2020/02/23 06:00,2020/02/21 06:00,2020/02/21 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/02/23 06:00 [medline],10.3760/cma.j.issn.1001-0939.2020.0020 [doi],aheadofprint,Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi. 2020 Feb 20;17(0):E020. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.1001-0939.2020.0020.,,,,,,,,,,,Respiratory care committee of Chinese Thoracic Society,,,,,,,,,

Here, we discuss the various mechanisms of SARS-CoV-mediated inflammation. We also assume that SARS-CoV-2 likely shares similar inflammatory responses. Potential therapeutic tools to reduce SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammatory responses include various methods to block FcR activation. In the absence of a proven clinical FcR blocker, the use of intravenous immunoglobulin to block FcR activation may be a viable option for the urgent treatment of pulmonary inflammation to prevent severe lung injury. Such treatment may also be combined with systemic anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids. However, these strategies, as proposed here, remain to be clinically tested for effectiveness.","Fu, Yajing | Cheng, Yuanxiong | Wu, Yuntao",Fu Y | Cheng Y | Wu Y,"NHC Key Laboratory of AIDS Immunology (China Medical University), Department of Laboratory Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, 110001, China. fufu80s@sina.com. | National Clinical Research Center for Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, 110001, China. fufu80s@sina.com. | Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510275, China. | National Center for Biodefense and Infectious Diseases, School of Systems Biology, George Mason University, Manassas, VA, 20110, USA. ywu8@gmu.edu.",eng,Journal Article | Review,20200303,China,Virol Sin,Virologica Sinica,101514185,IM,NOTNLM,Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) | Fc receptors (FcR) | Inflammatory response | SARS-CoV-2,2020/03/04 06:00,2020/03/04 06:00,2020/03/04 06:00,2020/02/14 00:00 [received] | 2020/02/16 00:00 [accepted] | 2020/03/04 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/04 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/04 06:00 [medline],10.1007/s12250-020-00207-4 [pii] | 10.1007/s12250-020-00207-4 [doi],aheadofprint,Virol Sin. 2020 Mar 3. doi: 10.1007/s12250-020-00207-4.,,,,,ORCID: 0000-0002-4343-2220 | ORCID: 0000-0002-9547-3278,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the temporal progression in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center study, we included confirmed cases of COVID-19 from Jan 20 to Feb 6, 2020 in Shanghai. Final date of follow-up was February 25, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 249 patients enrolled, the median age was 51 years old, and 126 (50.6%) were male. The duration from onset of symptoms to hospitalization was 4(2-7) days in symptomatic patients. Fever was occurred in 235(94.3%) patients. A total of 215 (86.3%) patients had been discharged after 16(12-20) days hospitalization. The estimated median duration of fever in all the patients with fever was 10 days (95 confidential intervals [CIs]: 8-11 days) after onset of symptoms. Patients who were transferred to intensive care units (ICU) had significantly longer duration of fever as compared to those not in ICU (31 days v.s. 9 days after onset of symptoms, respectively, P<0.0001). Radiological aggravation of initial image was observed in 163 (65.7%) patients on day 7 after onset of symptoms. 154(94.5%) of these patients showed radiological improvement on day 14. The median duration to negative reverse-transcriptase PCR tests of upper respiratory tract samples was 11 days (95 CIs: 10-12 days). Viral clearance was more likely to be delayed in patients in ICU than those not in ICU (P<0.0001). In multivariate logistical analysis, age (Odds ratio [OR]=1.06) and CD4 T cell count (OR=0.55 per 100 cells/ul increase) were independently associated with ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of COVID-19 cases are mild. The clinical progression pattern suggests that early control of viral replication and application of host-directed therapy in later stage is essential to improve the prognosis of CVOID-19.","Chen, Jun | Qi, Tangkai | Liu, Li | Ling, Yun | Qian, Zhiping | Li, Tao | Li, Feng | Xu, Qingnian | Zhang, Yuyi | Xu, Shuibao | Song, Zhigang | Zeng, Yigang | Shen, Yinzhong | Shi, Yuxin | Zhu, Tongyu | Lu, Hongzhou",Chen J | Qi T | Liu L | Ling Y | Qian Z | Li T | Li F | Xu Q | Zhang Y | Xu S | Song Z | Zeng Y | Shen Y | Shi Y | Zhu T | Lu H,"Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Shanghai, 201508, China. | Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Shanghai, 201508, China. | Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Shanghai, 201508, China. | Department of Infectious Diseases, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Shanghai, 201508, China. | Department of Liver Intensive Care Unit, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Shanghai, 201508, China. | Department of Tuberculosis, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Shanghai, 201508, China. | Department of Respiratory Diseases, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Shanghai, 201508, China. | Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Shanghai, 201508, China. | Department of Liver Intensive Care Unit, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Shanghai, 201508, China. | Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Shanghai, 201508, China. | Department of Pathogen Diagnosis and Biosafety, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Shanghai, 201508, China. | Department of Urology, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Shanghai, 201508, China. | Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Shanghai, 201508, China. | Department of Radiology, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Shanghai, 201508, China. | Department of Urology, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Shanghai, 201508, China.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the cases of parturients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection disease (COVID-19). Their epidemiologic history, chest computed tomography scans, laboratory measurements, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positivity were evaluated. We also recorded the patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, anesthesia and surgery-related data, maternal and neonatal complications, as well as the health status of the involved medical staff. RESULTS: The clinical characteristics of 17 pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were similar to those previously reported in non-pregnant adult patients. All of the 17 patients underwent Cesarean delivery with anesthesia performed according to standardized anesthesia/surgery procedures. Fourteen of the patients underwent continuous epidural anesthesia with 12 experiencing significant intraoperative hypotension. Three patients received general anesthesia with tracheal intubation because emergency surgery was needed. Three of the parturients are still recovering from their Cesarean delivery and are receiving in-hospital treatment for COVID-19. Three neonates were born prematurely. There were no deaths or serious neonatal asphyxia events. All neonatal SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests were negative. No medical staff were infected throughout the patient care period. CONCLUSIONS: Both epidural and general anesthesia were safely used for Cesarean delivery in the parturients with COVID-19. Nevertheless, the incidence of hypotension during epidural anesthesia appeared excessive. Proper patient transfer, medical staff access procedures, and effective biosafety precautions are important to protect medical staff from COVID-19.","Chen, Rong | Zhang, Yuan | Huang, Lei | Cheng, Bi-Heng | Xia, Zhong-Yuan | Meng, Qing-Tao",Chen R | Zhang Y | Huang L | Cheng BH | Xia ZY | Meng QT,"Department of Anesthesiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430060, China. | Department of Anesthesiology, East Hospital, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. | Department of Anesthesiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430060, China. | Department of Anesthesiology, East Hospital, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. | Department of Anesthesiology, East Hospital, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. | Department of Obstetric, East Hospital, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. | Department of Anesthesiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430060, China. | Department of Anesthesiology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430060, China. mengqingtao2018@126.com. | Department of Anesthesiology, East Hospital, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. mengqingtao2018@126.com.",eng,Journal Article,20200316,United States,Can J Anaesth,Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,8701709,IM,,,,,2020/03/18 06:00,2020/03/01 00:00 [received] | 2020/03/10 00:00 [accepted] | 2020/03/10 00:00 [revised] | 2020/03/18 06:00 [entrez],10.1007/s12630-020-01630-7 [pii] | 10.1007/s12630-020-01630-7 [doi],aheadofprint,Can J Anaesth. 2020 Mar 16. doi: 10.1007/s12630-020-01630-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sécurité et efficacité de différents modes d’anesthésie pour des parturientes infectées par la COVID-19 accouchant par césarienne : une série de 17 cas.,

Here, we tested the efficacy of prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir treatment in a nonhuman primate model of MERS-CoV infection, the rhesus macaque. Prophylactic remdesivir treatment initiated 24 h prior to inoculation completely prevented MERS-CoV-induced clinical disease, strongly inhibited MERS-CoV replication in respiratory tissues, and prevented the formation of lung lesions. Therapeutic remdesivir treatment initiated 12 h postinoculation also provided a clear clinical benefit, with a reduction in clinical signs, reduced virus replication in the lungs, and decreased presence and severity of lung lesions.

The virus has since rapidly spread to all provinces and autonomous regions of China, and to countries outside of China. Patients who become infected with 2019-nCoV may initially develop mild upper respiratory tract symptoms. However, a significant fraction of these patients goes on to subsequently develop serious lower respiratory disease. The effectiveness of adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy uses in the management of 2019-nCoV infected patients with severe lower respiratory tract infections is not clear, and warrants further investigation. METHODS: The present study will be conducted as an open-labelled, randomised controlled trial. We will enrol 48 subjects from Chongqing Public Health Medical Center. Each eligible subject will be assigned to an intervention group (methylprednisolone via intravenous injection at a dose of 1-2mg/kg/day for 3 days) or a control group (no glucocorticoid use) randomly, at a 1:1 ratio. Subjects in both groups will be invited for 28 days of follow-up which will be scheduled at 4 consecutive visit points. We will use the clinical improvement rate as our primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints include the timing of clinical improvement after intervention, duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of hospitalization, overall incidence of adverse events, as well as rate of adverse events at each visit, and mortality at 2 and 4 weeks. DISCUSSION: The present coronavirus outbreak is the third serious global coronavirus outbreak in the past two decades. Oral and parenteral glucocorticoids have been used in the management of severe respiratory symptoms in coronavirus-infected patients in the past. However, there remains no definitive evidence in the literature for or against the utilization of systemic glucocorticoids in seriously ill patients with coronavirus-related severe respiratory disease, or indeed in other types of severe respiratory disease. In this study, we hope to discover evidence either supporting or opposing the systemic therapeutic administration of glucocorticoids in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.

People of all ages are susceptible to COVID-19. However, literature reports on pediatric patients are limited. METHODS: To improve the recognition of COVID-19 infection in children, we retrospectively reviewed two confirmed pediatric cases from two family clusters. Both clinical features and laboratory examination results of the children and their family members were described. RESULTS: The two confirmed children only presented with mild respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. Both of them had normal chest CT images. After general and symptomatic treatments, both children recovered quickly. Both families had travel histories to Hubei Province. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with COVID-19 are mostly owing to family cluster or with a close contact history. Infected children have relatively milder clinical symptoms than infected adults. We should attach importance to early recognition, early diagnosis, and early treatment of infected children.","Ji, Li-Na | Chao, Shuang | Wang, Yue-Jiao | Li, Xue-Jun | Mu, Xiang-Dong | Lin, Ming-Gui | Jiang, Rong-Meng",Ji LN | Chao S | Wang YJ | Li XJ | Mu XD | Lin MG | Jiang RM,"Department of Pediatrics, Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital Affiliated To Tsinghua University, Litang Road No.168, Changping District, Beijing, 102218, China. jlna01103@btch.edu.cn. | Department of Pediatrics, Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital Affiliated To Tsinghua University, Litang Road No.168, Changping District, Beijing, 102218, China. | Department of Pediatrics, Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital Affiliated To Tsinghua University, Litang Road No.168, Changping District, Beijing, 102218, China. | Department of Pediatrics, Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital Affiliated To Tsinghua University, Litang Road No.168, Changping District, Beijing, 102218, China. | Department of Respiratory Medicine, Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital Affiliated To Tsinghua University, Litang Road No.168, Changping District, Beijing, 102218, China. | Department of Infectious Disease, Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital Affiliated To Tsinghua University, Litang Road No.168, Changping District, Beijing, 102218, China. | Department of Infectious Disease, Beijing Ditan Hospital Affiliated To Capital Medical University, Jingshun East Street No.8, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100011, China.",eng,Journal Article,20200316,Switzerland,World J Pediatr,World journal of pediatrics : WJP,101278599,IM,NOTNLM,COVID-19 | Children | Coronavirus | Wuhan,,,2020/03/18 06:00,2020/02/24 00:00 [received] | 2020/03/05 00:00 [accepted] | 2020/03/18 06:00 [entrez],10.1007/s12519-020-00356-2 [pii] | 10.1007/s12519-020-00356-2 [doi],aheadofprint,World J Pediatr. 2020 Mar 16. doi: 10.1007/s12519-020-00356-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although little is known about the virus, an examination of the genome sequence shows strong homology with its better-studied cousin, SARS-CoV. The spike protein used for host cell infection shows key nonsynonymous mutations that might hamper the efficacy of previously developed therapeutics but remains a viable target for the development of biologics and macrocyclic peptides. Other key drug targets, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and coronavirus main proteinase (3CLpro), share a strikingly high (>95 %) homology to SARS-CoV. Herein, we suggest four potential drug candidates (an ACE2-based peptide, remdesivir, 3CLpro-1 and a novel vinylsulfone protease inhibitor) that could be used to treat patients suffering with the 2019-nCoV. We also summarize previous efforts into drugging these targets and hope to help in the development of broad-spectrum anti-coronaviral agents for future epidemics.","Morse, Jared S | Lalonde, Tyler | Xu, Shiqing | Liu, Wenshe Ray",Morse JS | Lalonde T | Xu S | Liu WR,"The Texas A&M Drug Discovery Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843, USA. | The Texas A&M Drug Discovery Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843, USA. | The Texas A&M Drug Discovery Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843, USA. | The Texas A&M Drug Discovery Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843, USA.",eng,"Journal Article | Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural | Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",20200225,Germany,Chembiochem,Chembiochem : a European journal of chemical biology,100937360,IM,NOTNLM,*2019-nCoV | *3CLpro | *RdRp | *SARS | *antiviral agents | *coronavirus | *spike proteins,2020/02/06 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,2020/01/28 00:00 [received] | 2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/02/06 06:00 [medline] | 2020/02/06 06:00 [entrez],10.1002/cbic.202000047 [doi],ppublish,Chembiochem. 2020 Mar 2;21(5):730-738. doi: 10.1002/cbic.202000047.

All 12 cases of the 2019-nCoV-infected patients developed pneumonia and half of them developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The most common laboratory abnormalities were hypoalbuminemia, lymphopenia, decreased percentage of lymphocytes (LYM) and neutrophils (NEU), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and decreased CD8 count. The viral load of 2019-nCoV detected from patient respiratory tracts was positively linked to lung disease severity. ALB, LYM, LYM (%), LDH, NEU (%), and CRP were highly correlated to the acute lung injury. Age, viral load, lung injury score, and blood biochemistry indexes, albumin (ALB), CRP, LDH, LYM (%), LYM, and NEU (%), may be predictors of disease severity. Moreover, the Angiotensin II level in the plasma sample from 2019-nCoV infected patients was markedly elevated and linearly associated to viral load and lung injury. Our results suggest a number of potential diagnosis biomarkers and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) drugs for potential repurposing treatment of 2019-nCoV infection.","Liu, Yingxia | Yang, Yang |

Recently, a new emerged HCoV isolated from the respiratory epithelium of unexplained pneumonia patients in the Wuhan seafood market caused a major disease outbreak and has been named the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus causes acute lung symptoms, leading to a condition that has been named as ""coronavirus disease 2019"" (COVID-19). The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and of SARS-CoV caused widespread fear and concern and has threatened global health security. There are some similarities and differences in the epidemiology and clinical features between these two viruses and diseases that are caused by these viruses. The goal of this work is to systematically review and compare between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in the context of their virus incubation, originations, diagnosis and treatment methods, genomic and proteomic sequences, and pathogenic mechanisms.","Xu, Jiabao | Zhao, Shizhe | Teng, Tieshan | Abdalla, Abualgasim Elgaili | Zhu, Wan | Xie, Longxiang | Wang, Yunlong | Guo, Xiangqian",Xu J | Zhao S | Teng T | Abdalla AE | Zhu W | Xie L | Wang Y | Guo X,"Department of Preventive Medicine, Institute of Biomedical Informatics, Bioinformatics Center, Henan Provincial Engineering Center for Tumor Molecular Medicine, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Henan University, Kaifeng 475004, China. | Department of Preventive Medicine, Institute of Biomedical Informatics, Bioinformatics Center, Henan Provincial Engineering Center for Tumor Molecular Medicine, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Henan University, Kaifeng 475004, China. | Department of Preventive Medicine, Institute of Biomedical Informatics, Bioinformatics Center, Henan Provincial Engineering Center for Tumor Molecular Medicine, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Henan University, Kaifeng 475004, China. | Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Jouf University, Sakaka 2014, Saudi Arabia. | Department of Anesthesia, Stanford University, California 94305, USA. | Department of Preventive Medicine, Institute of Biomedical Informatics, Bioinformatics Center, Henan Provincial Engineering Center for Tumor Molecular Medicine, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Henan University, Kaifeng 475004, China. | Henan Bioengineering Research Center, Zhengzhou 450046, China. | Department of Preventive Medicine, Institute of Biomedical Informatics, Bioinformatics Center, Henan Provincial Engineering Center for Tumor Molecular Medicine, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Henan University, Kaifeng 475004, China.",eng,"Journal Article | Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",20200222,Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,IM,NOTNLM,*SARS-CoV | *SARS-CoV-2 | *clinical manifestations | *coronaviruses | *genomic comparison | *pathogenic mechanism | *proteomic comparison,2020/02/27 06:00,2020/02/27 06:00,2020/02/27 06:00,2020/02/04 00:00 [received] | 2020/02/18 00:00 [revised] | 2020/02/20 00:00 [accepted] | 2020/02/27 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/02/27 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/02/27 06:00 [medline],v12020244 [pii] | 10.3390/v12020244 [doi],epublish,Viruses. 2020 Feb 22;12(2):E244. doi: 10.3390/v12020244.,,201100310300/2020 New Coronavirus Prevention and Control Emergency Project/International | 18HASTIT048/Program for Innovative Talents of Science and Technology in Henan Province/International,The authors declare no conflict of interest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We reviewed the currently available literature of microbiologically confirmed infections by 2019-ConV (or COVID-19) occurred at the time of writing (13 February 2020). A literature search was performed using the PubMed database and the Cochrane library. Search terms included ""novel coronavirus"" or ""2019-nCoV"" or ""COVID-19"". RESULTS: Published cases occurred mostly in males (age ranged from 8 to 92). Cardiovascular, digestive and endocrine system diseases were commonly reported, except previous chronic pulmonary diseases (e.g., COPD, asthma, bronchiectasis) that were surprisingly underreported. Fever was presented in all the case series available, flanked by cough, dyspnea, myalgias and fatigue. Multiple bilateral lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation or bilateral ground-glass opacities were the main reported radiological features of 2019-nCoV, at least in the early phases of disease. CONCLUSIONS: The new 2019-nCoV epidemics is mainly associated with respiratory disease and few extrapulmonary signs. However, there is a low rate of associated pre-existing respiratory comorbidities.","Lupia, Tommaso | Scabini, Silvia | Pinna, Simone Mornese | Di Perri, Giovanni | De Rosa, Francesco Giuseppe | Corcione, Silvia",Lupia T | Scabini S | Pinna SM | Di Perri G | De Rosa FG | Corcione S,"Department of Medical Sciences, Infectious Diseases, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.

The spike protein of coronaviruses is the main driving force for host cell recognition. METHODS: In this study, the COVID-19 spike binding site to the cell-surface receptor (Glucose Regulated Protein 78 (GRP78)) is predicted using combined molecular modeling docking and structural bioinformatics. The COVID-19 spike protein is modeled using its counterpart, the SARS spike. RESULTS: Sequence and structural alignments show that four regions, in addition to its cyclic nature have sequence and physicochemical similarities to the cyclic Pep42. Protein-protein docking was performed to test the four regions of the spike that fit tightly in the GRP78 Substrate Binding Domain β (SBDβ). The docking pose revealed the involvement of the SBDβ of GRP78 and the receptor-binding domain of the coronavirus spike protein in recognition of the host cell receptor. CONCLUSIONS: We reveal that the binding is more favorable between regions III (C391-C525) and IV (C480-C488) of the spike protein model and GRP78. Region IV is the main driving force for GRP78 binding with the predicted binding affinity of -9.8 kcal/mol. These nine residues can be used to develop therapeutics specific against COVID-19.","Ibrahim, Ibrahim M | Abdelmalek, Doaa H | Elshahat, Mohammed E | Elfiky, Abdo A",Ibrahim IM | Abdelmalek DH | Elshahat ME | Elfiky AA,"Biophysics Department, Faculty of Sciences, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt. | Biophysics Department, Faculty of Sciences, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt. | Biophysics Department, Faculty of Sciences, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt. | Biophysics Department, Faculty of Sciences, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt; College of Applied Medical Sciences, University of Al-Jouf, KSA.

Given the current growing spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) around the world, it is imperative that businesses review their pandemic plans and be prepared in case this epidemic expands and affects more people and communities. Preparing for a potential infectious disease pandemic from influenza or a novel corona virus is an essential component of a business continuity plan, especially for businesses that provide critical healthcare and infrastructure services. Although many businesses and organisations have a pandemic plan or address pandemic preparedness in their business continuity plans, few have recently tested and updated their plans. Pandemics can not only interrupt an organisation's operations and compromise long-term viability of an enterprise, but also disrupt the provision of critical functions. Businesses that regularly test and update their pandemic plan can significantly reduce harmful impacts to the business, play a key role in protecting employees' and customers' health and safety, and limit the negative impact of a pandemic on the community and economy.","Koonin, Lisa M",Koonin LM,Health Preparedness Partners.,eng,Journal Article,,England,J Bus Contin Emer Plan,Journal of business continuity & emergency planning,101509784,IM,,,2020/03/13 06:00,2020/03/17 06:00,2020/03/13 06:00,2020/03/13 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/13 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/17 06:00 [medline],,ppublish,J Bus Contin Emer Plan. 2020 Jan 1;13(4):1-15.,,,,20200316,,0 (COVID-19),,"*Commerce/organization & administration | *Coronavirus | *Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology/prevention & control | Delivery of Health Care | *Disaster Planning | Disease Outbreaks | Humans | Influenza, Human | Pandemics | *Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology/prevention & control",,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to compare arbidol and lopinavir/ritonavir(LPV/r) treatment for patients with COVID-19 with LPV/r only. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we included adults (age≥18years) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 without Invasive ventilation, diagnosed between Jan 17, 2020, and Feb 13, 2020. Patients, diagnosed after Jan 17, 2020, were given oral arbidol and LPV/r in the combination group and oral LPV/r only in the monotherapy group for 5-21 days. The primary endpoint was a negative conversion rate of coronavirus from the date of COVID-19 diagnosis(day7, day14), and assessed whether the pneumonia was progressing or improving by chest CT (day7). RESULTS: We analyzed 16 patients who received oral arbidol and LPV/r in the combination group and 17 who oral LPV/r only in the monotherapy group, and both initiated after diagnosis. Baseline clinical, laboratory, and chest CT characteristics were similar between groups. The SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected for 12(75%) of 16 patients' nasopharyngeal specimens in the combination group after seven days, compared with 6 (35%) of 17 in the monotherapy group (p<0•05). After 14 days, 15 (94%) of 16 and 9 (52•9%) of 17, respectively, SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected (p<0•05). The chest CT scans were improving for 11(69%) of 16 patients in the combination group after seven days, compared with 5(29%) of 17 in the monotherapy group (p<0•05). CONCLUSION: In patients with COVID-19, the apparent favorable clinical response with arbidol and LPV/r supports further LPV/r only.","Deng, Lisi | Li, Chunna | Zeng, Qi | Liu, Xi | Li, Xinghua | Zhang, Haitang | Hong, Zhongsi | Xia, Jinyu",Deng L | Li C | Zeng Q | Liu X | Li X | Zhang H | Hong Z | Xia J,"Department of Infectious Diseases, the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, China. | Department of Infectious Diseases, the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, China. | Cancer Center, the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, China. | Department of Infectious Diseases, the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, China. | Department of Infectious Diseases, the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, China. | Department of Infectious Diseases, the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, China. | Department of Infectious Diseases, the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, China.

Results: Compared with the general group, the lymphocyte count (0.74×10(9) (0.34×10(9), 0.94×10(9))/L vs. 0.99×10(9) (0.71×10(9), 1.29×10(9))/L, P=0.03) was extremely lower in the critical group, CRP (106.98 (81.57, 135.76) mg/L vs. 34.34 (9.55,76.54) mg/L, P<0.001) and PCT (0.20 (0.15,0.48) μg/L vs. 0.11 (0.06,0.20)μg/L, P<0.001) were significantly higher in the critical group. The BMI of the critical group was significantly higher than that of the general group (25.5 (23.0, 27.5) kg/m(2) vs. 22.0 (20.0, 24.0) kg/m(2), P=0.003). Patients were further divided into non-survivor group (17, 15.18%) group and survivor group (95, 84.82%). Among the non-survivors, there were 88.24% (15/17) patients with BMI> 25 kg/m(2), which was significantly higher than that of survivors (18.95% (18/95), P<0.001). Compared with the survived patients, oxygenation index (130 (102, 415) vs. 434 (410, 444), P<0.001) was significantly lower and lactic acid (1.70 (1.30, 3.00) mmol/L vs. 1.20 (1.10, 1.60) mmol/L, P<0.001) was significantly higher in the non-survivors. There was no significant difference in the proportion of ACEI/ARB medication between the critical group and the general group or between non-survivors and survivors (all P>0.05). Conclusion: COVID-19 patients combined with CVD are associated with a higher risk of mortality. Critical patients are characterized with lower lymphocyte counts. Higher BMI are more often seen in critical patients and non-survivor. ACEI/ARB use does not affect the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 combined with CVD. Aggravating causes of death include fulminant inflammation, lactic acid accumulation and thrombotic events.","Peng, Y D | Meng, K | Guan, H Q | Leng, L | Zhu, R R | Wang, B Y | He, M A | Cheng, L X | Huang, K | Zeng, Q T",Peng YD | Meng K | Guan HQ | Leng L | Zhu RR | Wang BY | He MA | Cheng LX | Huang K | Zeng QT,"Department of Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China. | Department of Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China. | Department of Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China. | Department of Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China. | Department of Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China. | Department of Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China. | School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China. | Department of Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China. | Department of Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China. | Department of Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.",chi,English Abstract | Journal Article,20200302,China,Zhonghua Xin Xue Guan Bing Za Zhi,Zhonghua xin xue guan bing za zhi,7910682,IM,NOTNLM,COVID-19 | Cardiovascular diseases | Treatment outcome,2020/03/04 06:00,2020/03/04 06:00,2020/03/03 06:00,2020/03/03 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/04 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/04 06:00 [medline],10.3760/cma.j.cn112148-20200220-00105 [doi],aheadofprint,Zhonghua Xin Xue Guan Bing Za Zhi. 2020 Mar 2;48(0):E004. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112148-20200220-00105.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the fact that most COVID-19 cases and mortalities were reported in China, the WHO has declared this outbreak as the sixth public health emergency of international concern. The COVID-19 can present as an asymptomatic carrier state, acute respiratory disease, and pneumonia. Adults represent the population with the highest infection rate; however, neonates, children, and elderly patients can also be infected by SARS-CoV-2. In addition, nosocomial infection of hospitalized patients and healthcare workers, and viral transmission from asymptomatic carriers are possible. The most common finding on chest imaging among patients with pneumonia was ground-glass opacity with bilateral involvement. Severe cases are more likely to be older patients with underlying comorbidities compared to mild cases. Indeed, age and disease severity may be correlated with the outcomes of COVID-19. To date, effective treatment is lacking; however, clinical trials investigating the efficacy of several agents, including remdesivir and chloroquine, are underway in China.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical characteristics of elderly patients with new-type coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19). METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients with new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) who were hospitalized in Hainan Provincial People's Hospital from January 15, 2020 to February 18, 2020. Compare the clinical characteristics of elderly with Young and Middle-aged patients. RESULTS: A total of 56 patients were evaluated, 18 elderly patients (32.14%), and 38 young and middle-aged patients (67.86%). The most common symptoms in both groups were fever, followed by cough and sputum. Four patients in the elderly group received negative pressure ICU for mechanical ventilation, and five patients in the young and middle-aged group. One patient died in the elderly group (5.56%), and two patients died in the young and middle-aged group (5.26%). The PSI score of the elderly group was higher than that of the young and middle-aged group (P<0.001). The proportion of patients with PSI grades IV and V was significantly higher in the elderly group than in the young and middle-aged group (P<0.05). The proportion of multiple lobe involvement in the elderly group was higher than that in the young and middle-aged group (P<0.001), and there was no difference in single lobe lesions between the two groups. The proportion of lymphocytes in the elderly group was significantly lower than that in the young and middle-aged group (P<0.001), and the C-reactive protein was significantly higher in the young group (P<0.001).

In severe novel coronavirus pneumonia cases, the number of platelets, their dynamic changes during the treatment, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio(PLR)were a concern. We sought to describe platelet feature of these cases. METHODS: Single-center case series of the 30 hospitalized patients with confirmed Corona Virus Disease(COVID)-19 in Huizhou municipal central hospitalfrom January 2020 to February 2020 were retrospectively analysed. Demographic, clinical, blood routine results, other laborotary results and treatment date were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of severe patients and non-severe patients were compared. RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that: age, platelet peaks and PLR at peak platelet were the influencing factors in severe patients,multivariate analysis showed that the PLR value at peak platelet during treatment was an independent influencing factor in severe patients.The average hospitalization day of patients with platelet peaks during treatment were longer than those without platelet peaks(P<0.05).The average age of patients with platelet peaks during treatment were older than those without platelet peaks(P<0.05). The patients with significantly elevated platelets during treatment had longer average hospitalization day. And the higher PLR of patients during treatment had longer average hospitalization day. CONCLUSION: Single-center case series of the 30 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Huizhou municipal central hospital, presumed that the number of platelets and their dynamic changes during the treatment may have suggestion on the severity and prognosis of disease. The patient with markedly elevated platelets and longer average hospitalization day may be related to the cytokine storm. The PLR of patients means the degree of cytokine storm, which might provide a new indicator in the monitoring in patients with COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright.

METHODS: There were two main steps in the screening process. In the first step we conducted a literature search for natural compounds that had been biologically confirmed as against sever acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Resulting compounds were cross-checked for listing in the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database. Compounds meeting both requirements were subjected to absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) evaluation to verify that oral administration would be effective. Next, a docking analysis was used to test whether the compound had the potential for direct 2019-nCoV protein interaction. In the second step we searched Chinese herbal databases to identify plants containing the selected compounds. Plants containing 2 or more of the compounds identified in our screen were then checked against the catalogue for classic herbal usage. Finally, network pharmacology analysis was used to predict the general in vivo effects of each selected herb. RESULTS: Of the natural compounds screened, 13 that exist in traditional Chinese medicines were also found to have potential anti-2019-nCoV activity. Further, 125 Chinese herbs were found to contain 2 or more of these 13 compounds. Of these 125 herbs, 26 are classically catalogued as treating viral respiratory infections. Network pharmacology analysis predicted that the general in vivo roles of these 26 herbal plants were related to regulating viral infection, immune/inflammation reactions and hypoxia response. CONCLUSION: Chinese herbal treatments classically used for treating viral respiratory infection might contain direct anti-2019-nCoV compounds.","Zhang, Deng-Hai | Wu, Kun-Lun | Zhang, Xue | Deng, Sheng-Qiong | Peng, Bin",Zhang DH | Wu KL | Zhang X | Deng SQ | Peng B,"Shanghai Health Commission Key Lab of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Based Management of Inflammation and Chronic Diseases, Sino-French Cooperative Central Lab, Shanghai Pudong Gongli Hospital, Secondary Military Medical University, Shanghai 200135, China.

Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on clinical data and chest CT images of 15 children diagnosed with 2019-nCoV. They were admitted to the third people's Hospital of Shenzhen from January 16 to February 6, 2020. The distribution and morphology of pulmonary lesions on chest CT images were analyzed. Results: Among the 15 children, there were 5 males and 10 females, aged from 4 to 14 years old. Five of the 15 children were febrile and 10 were asymptomatic on first visit. The first nasal or pharyngeal swab samples in all the 15 cases were positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid. For their first chest CT images, 6 patients had no lesions, while 9 patients had pulmonary inflammation lesions. Seven cases of small nodular ground glass opacities and 2 cases of speckled ground glass opacities were found. After 3 to 5 days of treatment, 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in a second respiratory sample turned negative in 6 cases. Among them, chest CT images showed less lesions in 2 cases, no lesion in 3 cases, and no improvement in 1 case. Other 9 cases were still positive in a second nucleic acid test. Six patients showed similar chest CT inflammation, while 3 patients had new lesions, which were all small nodular ground glass opacities. Conclusions: The early chest CT images of children with 2019-nCoV infection are mostly small nodular ground glass opacities. The clinical symptoms of children with 2019-nCoV infection are nonspecific. Dynamic reexamination of chest CT and nucleic acid are important. | Previous studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were mainly based on information from adult populations. Limited data are available for children with COVID-19, especially for infected infants.

Despite drastic containment measures, the spread of this virus is ongoing. SARS-CoV-2 is the aetiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) characterised by pulmonary infection in humans. The efforts of international health authorities have since focused on rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients as well as the search for therapies able to counter the most severe effects of the disease. In the absence of a known efficient therapy and because of the situation of a public-health emergency, it made sense to investigate the possible effect of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 since this molecule was previously described as a potent inhibitor of most coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1. Preliminary trials of chloroquine repurposing in the treatment of COVID-19 in China have been encouraging, leading to several new trials. Here we discuss the possible mechanisms of chloroquine interference with the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle.","Devaux, Christian A | Rolain, Jean-Marc | Colson, Philippe | Raoult, Didier",Devaux CA | Rolain JM | Colson P | Raoult D,"Aix-Marseille Université, IRD, APHM, MEPHI, IHU-Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France; CNRS, Marseille, France; IHU-Méditerranée Infection, 19-21 boulevard Jean Moulin, 13005 Marseille, France.

More than 100 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are approved or in late stage clinical trials, many of which harness the potent FcγR-mediated effector systems to varying degrees. This is most evident for antibodies targeting cancer cells inducing antibody-dependent killing or phagocytosis but is also true to some degree for the mAbs that neutralise or remove small macromolecules such as cytokines or other immunoglobulins. The use of mAb therapeutics has also revealed a ""scaffolding"" role for FcγR which, in different contexts, may either underpin the therapeutic mAb action such as immune agonism or may trigger catastrophic adverse effects. The still unmet therapeutic need in many cancers, inflammatory diseases or emerging infections such as SARS-CoV-2, requires increased effort on the development of improved and novel mAbs. A more mature appreciation of the immunobiology of individual FcγR function and the complexity of the relationships between FcγRs and antibodies is fuelling efforts to develop more potent ""next-gen"" therapeutic antibodies. Such development strategies now include focused glycan or protein engineering of the Fc to increase affinity and/or tailor specificity for selective engagement of individual activating FcγRs or the inhibitory FcγRIIb or alternatively, for the ablation of FcγR interaction altogether. This review touches on recent aspects FcγR and IgG immunobiology and its relationship to the present and future actions of therapeutic mAbs.","Chenoweth, Alicia M | Wines, Bruce D | Anania, Jessica C | Mark Hogarth, P",Chenoweth AM | Wines BD | Anania JC | Mark Hogarth P,"Immune therapies laboratory, Burnet Institute, Melbourne, 3004, Australia. | King's College, London, UK. | Department of Immunology and Pathology, Central Clinical School, Monash University Melbourne, Australia. | Immune therapies laboratory, Burnet Institute, Melbourne, 3004, Australia. | Department of Immunology and Pathology, Central Clinical School, Monash University Melbourne, Australia. | Department of Clinical Pathology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia. | Immune therapies laboratory, Burnet Institute, Melbourne, 3004, Australia. | Department of Immunology and Pathology, Central Clinical School, Monash University Melbourne, Australia. | Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. | Immune therapies laboratory, Burnet Institute, Melbourne, 3004, Australia. | Department of Immunology and Pathology, Central Clinical School, Monash University Melbourne, Australia.",eng,Journal Article | Review,20200311,United States,Immunol Cell Biol,Immunology and cell biology,8706300,IM,NOTNLM,ADCC | ADCP | Antibodies; Coronavirus | Fc Receptors | SARS-CoV-2 | biologic drugs | immune agonism | monoclonal antibodies | phagocytosis | translational immunology,2020/03/12 06:00,2020/03/12 06:00,2020/03/12 06:00,2020/03/12 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/12 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/12 06:00 [medline],10.1111/imcb.12326 [doi],aheadofprint,Immunol Cell Biol. 2020 Mar 11. doi: 10.1111/imcb.12326.,This article is protected by copyright.

Methods: The general conditions, biochemical indicators of liver, blood clotting mechanism, routine blood test, UGT1A1 * 28 gene polymorphism and other data of 40 cases with COVID-19 admitted to the isolation ward of Tangdu Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. The clinical characteristics, influencing factors and prognosis of liver injury in patients with liver injury group and those with normal liver function group were compared. The mean of two samples in univariate analysis was compared by t-test and analysis of variance. The counting data was measured by χ(2) tests. The non-normal distribution measurement data were described by the median, and the non-parametric test was used. Statistically significant influencing factors were used as the independent variables in univariate analysis. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the main influencing factors of liver injury. Results: Of the 40 cases, 25 were male (62.5%) and 15 were female (37.5%), aged 22 to 83 (53.87 ± 15.84) years. Liver injury was occurred in 22 cases (55%) during the course of the disease. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level was initially increased (4.4 to 3.5 times of the normal value) along with decrease of albumin in the second week, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Ten cases (43.5%) had highest abnormal total blood bilirubin (54.1 μmol/ L). There was no correlation between the increase in transaminase and the increase in total blood bilirubin (R = -0.006, P = 0.972). Three cases had prothrombin activity (PTA) of ≤ 50%, 10 cases had elevated FDP, and 13 cases had elevated D-dimer, all of whom were severe or critically ill. Liver function injury was more likely to occur in patients who used many types of drugs and large amounts of hormones (P = 0.002, P = 0.031), and there was no correlation with the TA6TA7 mutation in the UGT1A1 * 28 gene locus. Multiple regression analysis showed that the occurrence of liver injury was only related to critical illness. The liver function of all patients had recovered within one week after conventional liver protection treatment. Conclusion: COVID-19 combined with liver function injury may be due to the slight elevation of transaminase, mostly around the second week of the disease course. Severe patients have a higher proportion of liver injury, and critical type is an independent risk factor for liver injury.","Yao, N | Wang, S N | Lian, J Q | Sun, Y T | Zhang, G F | Kang, W Z | Kang, W",Yao N | Wang SN | Lian JQ | Sun YT | Zhang GF | Kang WZ | Kang W,"Department of Infectious Diseases, Tangdu Hospital, the Air Force Medical University, Xi'an 710038, China. | Department of Infectious Diseases, Tangdu Hospital, the Air Force Medical University, Xi'an 710038, China. | Department of Infectious Diseases, Tangdu Hospital, the Air Force Medical University, Xi'an 710038, China. | Department of Infectious Diseases, Tangdu Hospital, the Air Force Medical University, Xi'an 710038, China. | Department of Infectious Diseases, Tangdu Hospital, the Air Force Medical University, Xi'an 710038, China. | Department of Infectious Diseases, Tangdu Hospital, the Air Force Medical University, Xi'an 710038, China. | Department of Infectious Diseases, Tangdu Hospital, the Air Force Medical University, Xi'an 710038, China.",chi,English Abstract | Journal Article,20200310,China,Zhonghua Gan Zang Bing Za Zhi,Zhonghua gan zang bing za zhi = Zhonghua ganzangbing zazhi = Chinese journal of hepatology,9710009,IM,NOTNLM,COVID-19 | Clinical characteristics | Liver function | Liver injury | Prognosis | Risk factor,2020/03/11 06:00,2020/03/11 06:00,2020/03/11 06:00,2020/03/11 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/11 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/11 06:00 [medline],10.3760/cma.j.cn501113-20200226-00070 [doi],aheadofprint,Zhonghua Gan Zang Bing Za Zhi. 2020 Mar 10;28(0):E003. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.cn501113-20200226-00070.,,2020ZDXM-SF-003/Key R & D Plan of Shaanxi Province/ | 2017ZX10204401-002-005/National Science and Technology Major Project/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: The placentas delivered from pregnant women with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection which were received in the Department of Pathology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology collected by February 4th, 2020 and retrospectively studied. Their clinical material including placental tissue and lung CT, and laboratory results were collected, meanwhile, nucleic acid detection of 2019-nCoV of the placentas were performed by RT-PCR. Results: Three placentas delivered from pregnant women with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, who were all in their third trimester with emergency caesarean section. All of the three patients presented with fever (one before caesarean and two in postpartum), and had no significant leukopenia and lymphopenia. Neonatal throat swabs from three newborns were tested for 2019-nCoV, and all samples were negative for the nucleic acid of 2019-nCoV. One premature infant was transferred to Department of Neonatology due to low birth weight. By the end of February 25, 2020, none of the three patients developed severe 2019-nCoV pneumonia or died(two patients had been cured and discharged, while another one had been transferred to a square cabin hospital for isolation treatment). There were various degrees of fibrin deposition inside and around the villi with local syncytial nodule increases in all three placentas. One case of placenta showed the concomitant morphology of chorionic hemangioma and another one with massive placental infarction. No pathological change of villitis and chorioamnionitis was observed in our observation of three cases. All samples from three placentas were negative for the nucleic acid of 2019-nCoV. Conclusions: The clinical characteristics of pregnant women with 2019-nCoV infection in late pregnancy are similar to those of non-pregnant patients, and no severe adverse pregnancy outcome is found in the 3 cases of our observation. Pathological study suggests that there are no morphological changes related to infection in the three placentas. Currently no evidence for intrauterine vertical transmission of 2019-nCoV is found in the three women infected by 2019-nCoV in their late pregnancy.","Chen, S | Huang, B | Luo, D J | Li, X | Yang, F | Zhao, Y | Nie, X | Huang, B X",Chen S | Huang B | Luo DJ | Li X | Yang F | Zhao Y | Nie X | Huang BX,"Department of Pathology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China. | Department of Pathology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China. | Department of Pathology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China. | Department of Pathology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China. | Department of Radiology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China. | Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology,Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China. | Department of Pathology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China. | Department of Pathology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.",chi,English Abstract | Journal Article,20200301,China,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology,0005331,IM,NOTNLM,2019-nCoV | Clinical characteristic | Pneumonia | placental pathology | prgnant women | vertical transmission,2020/03/03 06:00,2020/03/03 06:00,2020/03/03 06:00,2020/03/03 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/03 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/03 06:00 [medline],10.3760/cma.j.cn112151-20200225-00138 [doi],aheadofprint,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi. 2020 Mar 1;49(0):E005. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112151-20200225-00138.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described. METHODS: In this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (≥18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. FINDINGS: 191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital. 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03-1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61-12·23; p<0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/L (18·42, 2·64-128·55; p=0·0033) on admission. Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0-24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors. The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days. INTERPRETATION: The potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/L could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage. Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.

The scientific interest on coronaviruses increased after the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreaks in 2002-2003 followed by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV). This decade's first CoV, named 2019-nCoV, emerged from Wuhan, China, and declared as 'Public Health Emergency of International Concern' on January 30(th), 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). As on February 4, 2020, 425 deaths reported in China only and one death outside China (Philippines). In a short span of time, the virus spread has been noted in 24 countries. The zoonotic transmission (animal-to-human) is suspected as the route of disease origin. The genetic analyses predict bats as the most probable source of 2019-nCoV though further investigations needed to confirm the origin of the novel virus. The ongoing nCoV outbreak highlights the hidden wild animal reservoir of the deadly viruses and possible threat of spillover zoonoses as well. The successful virus isolation attempts have made doors open for developing better diagnostics and effective vaccines helping in combating the spread of the virus to newer areas.","Malik, Yashpal Singh | Sircar, Shubhankar | Bhat, Sudipta | Sharun, Khan | Dhama, Kuldeep | Dadar, Maryam | Tiwari, Ruchi | Chaicumpa, Wanpen",Malik YS | Sircar S | Bhat S | Sharun K | Dhama K | Dadar M | Tiwari R | Chaicumpa W,"Division of Biological Standardization, ICAR-Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, India. | Division of Biological Standardization, ICAR-Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, India. | Division of Biological Standardization, ICAR-Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, India. | Division of Surgery, ICAR-Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, India. | Division of Pathology, ICAR-Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, India. | Razi Vaccine and Serum Research Institute, Agricultural Research, Education and Extension Organization (AREEO), Karaj, Iran. | Department of Veterinary Microbiology and Immunology, College of Veterinary Sciences, Deen Dayal Upadhayay Pashu Chikitsa Vigyan Vishwavidyalay Evum Go-Anusandhan Sansthan (DUVASU), Mathura, India. | Center of Research Excellence on Therapeutic Proteins and Antibody Engineering, Department of Parasitology, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.",eng,Journal Article | Review,,,Vet Q,The veterinary quarterly,7909485,IM,NOTNLM,2019-nCoV | Coronavirus | Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV | Public Health Emergency | Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV | genetic analyses | reservoir host | therapeutics | vaccines | zoonoses,2020/02/11 06:00,2020/03/17 06:00,2020/02/11 06:00,2020/02/11 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/17 06:00 [medline] | 2020/02/11 06:00 [entrez],1727993 [pii] | 10.1080/01652176.2020.1727993 [doi],ppublish,Vet Q. 2020 Dec;40(1):68-76. doi: 10.1080/01652176.2020.1727993.,,,,20200316,ORCID: 0000-0002-2832-4854 | ORCID: 0000-0001-7469-4752,txid2697049 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2),,"Animals | *Betacoronavirus/classification/genetics | Chiroptera/*virology | Communicable Diseases, Emerging/prevention & control/transmission/veterinary/*virology | Coronavirus Infections/*epidemiology/prevention & control/transmission/virology | Disease Reservoirs/*veterinary/virology | Humans | Pandemics | Phylogeny | Zoonoses/epidemiology/prevention & control/virology",PMC7054940,,,,,,,,,,,

The main manifestations were fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, normal or leukopenia in peripheral blood and changes in chest CT and in severe cases, multiple organ failure might occur. The National Health Commission, PRC has revised the consensus on diagnosis and treatment seven times in a short period of time, indicating the growing understanding of the disease. Patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia usually had history of travelling or living in the epidemic area including Wuhan within 14 days before onset, or have been exposed to patients who had fever or respiratory symptoms from the epidemic area, or had clustering diseases. However, novel coronavirus pneumonia was becoming more and more blurred after vanishing epidemic. The diagnosis and differential diagnosis of novel coronavirus pneumonia was facing challenges not only because of large number of tourists increasing dramatically after the relieving of epidemic, but also patients with other diseases return from different areas to search for medical care. In this article, the clinical and chest imaging features of the novel coronavirus pneumonia were reviewed and compared with other infections and non-infectious diffuse pulmonary diseases.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on the imaging findings of patients confirmed with COVID-19 pneumonia who had chest CT scanning and treatment after disease onset. The clinical and imaging data were analyzed. RESULTS: Fifty patients were enrolled, including mild type in nine, common in 28, severe in 10 and critically severe in the rest three. Mild patients (29 years) were significantly (P<0.03) younger than either common (44.5 years) or severe (54.7) and critically severe (65.7 years) patients, and common patients were also significantly (P<0.03) younger than severe and critically severe patients. Mild patients had low to moderate fever (<39.1 °C), 49 (98%) patients had normal or slightly reduced leukocyte count, 14 (28%) had decreased counts of lymphocytes, and 26 (52%) patients had increased C-reactive protein. Nine mild patients were negative in CT imaging. For all the other types of NCP, the lesion was in the right upper lobe in 30 cases, right middle lobe in 22, right lower lobe in 39, left upper lobe in 33 and left lower lobe in 36. The lesion was primarily located in the peripheral area under the pleura with possible extension towards the pulmonary hilum. Symmetrical lesions were seen in 26 cases and asymmetrical in 15. The density of lesion was mostly uneven with ground glass opacity as the primary presentation accompanied by partial consolidation and fibrosis. CONCLUSION: CT imaging presentations of NCP are mostly patchy ground glass opacities in the peripheral areas under the pleura with partial consolidation which will be absorbed with formation of fibrotic stripes if improved. CT scanning provides important bases for early diagnosis and treatment of NCP.","Xu, Yu-Huan | Dong, Jing-Hui | An, Wei-Min | Lv, Xiao-Yan | Yin, Xiao-Ping | Zhang, Jian-Zeng | Dong, Li | Ma, Xi | Zhang, Hong-Jie | Gao, Bu-Lang",Xu YH | Dong JH | An WM | Lv XY | Yin XP | Zhang JZ | Dong L | Ma X | Zhang HJ | Gao BL,"Department of Radiology, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, 100 West Fourth Ring Road, Fengtai District, Beijing 100039, China. | Department of Radiology, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, 100 West Fourth Ring Road, Fengtai District, Beijing 100039, China. | Department of Radiology, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, 100 West Fourth Ring Road, Fengtai District, Beijing 100039, China. | Department of Radiology, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, 100 West Fourth Ring Road, Fengtai District, Beijing 100039, China.

How these diverse receptor recognition patterns affect viral entry is unknown. Mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) is the only known coronavirus that uses the N-terminal domain (NTD) of its spike to recognize a protein receptor, CEACAM1a. Here we determined the cryo-EM structure of MHV spike complexed with mouse CEACAM1a. The trimeric spike contains three receptor-binding S1 heads sitting on top of a trimeric membrane-fusion S2 stalk. Three receptor molecules bind to the sides of the spike trimer, where three NTDs are located. Receptor binding induces structural changes in the spike, weakening the interactions between S1 and S2. Using protease sensitivity and negative-stain EM analyses, we further showed that after protease treatment of the spike, receptor binding facilitated the dissociation of S1 from S2, allowing S2 to transition from pre-fusion to post-fusion conformation. Together these results reveal a new role of receptor binding in MHV entry: in addition to its well-characterized role in viral attachment to host cells, receptor binding also induces the conformational change of the spike and hence the fusion of viral and host membranes. Our study provides new mechanistic insight into coronavirus entry and highlights the diverse entry mechanisms used by different viruses.","Shang, Jian | Wan, Yushun | Liu, Chang | Yount, Boyd | Gully, Kendra | Yang, Yang | Auerbach, Ashley | Peng, Guiqing | Baric, Ralph | Li, Fang",Shang J | Wan Y | Liu C | Yount B | Gully K | Yang Y | Auerbach A | Peng G | Baric R | Li F,"Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States of America. | Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States of America. | Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States of America. | Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America. | Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America. | Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States of America. | Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States of America. | College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China. | Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America. | Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States of America.",eng,Journal Article,20200309,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,IM,,,2020/03/10 06:00,2020/03/10 06:00,2020/03/10 06:00,2019/10/23 00:00 [received] | 2020/02/08 00:00 [accepted] | 2020/03/10 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/10 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/10 06:00 [medline],PPATHOGENS-D-19-01992 [pii] | 10.1371/journal.ppat.1008392 [doi],aheadofprint,PLoS Pathog. 2020 Mar 9;16(3):e1008392. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1008392.,,,The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.,,ORCID: 0000-0003-2600-6059 | ORCID: 0000-0003-1829-0117 | ORCID: 0000-0001-5742-2341 | ORCID: 0000-0001-9061-3828 | ORCID: 0000-0001-8505-5905 | ORCID: 0000-0001-8813-6663 | ORCID: 0000-0001-6827-8701 | ORCID: 0000-0002-1958-366X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This recommendation is intended to be followed by healthcare workers (HCWs) of pulmonary function testing laboratory when COVID-19 is in epidemic. Based on the features of pulmonary function testing, precaution principles and strategies are developed in three aspects of management for HCWs, operating procedure, environment and equipment. Indications of pulmonary function testing should be followed strictly. It is strongly recommended to suspend the test for the confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 during the contagious stage, and to postpone the test for other patients if it is not imperative.

Methods: A retrospective analysis of the epidemiological history, clinical symptoms, signs, laboratory examinations, chest imaging, treatment and the short-term prognosis of 31 cases of 2019-nCoV was conducted. The patients were diagnosed between January 25th, 2020 and February 21st, 2020 in 21 hospitals in 17 cities of six provinces(autonomous region) of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Hebei, Henan and Shandong. Results: The age of the 31 children with 2019-nCoV infection was 7 years and 1 month (6 months -17 years). Nine cases (29%) were imported cases. Other 21 cases (68%) had contact with confirmed infected adults. One case (3%) had contact with asymptomatic returnees from Wuhan. Among the 31 children, 28 patients (90%) were family cluster cases. The clinical types were asymptomatic type in 4 cases (13%), mild type in 13 cases (42%), and common type in 14 cases (45%). No severe or critical type existed. The most common symptom was fever (n=20, 65%), including 1 case of high fever, 9 cases of moderate fever, 10 cases of low fever. Fever lasted from 1 day to 9 days. The fever of fifteen cases lasted for ≤3 d, while in other 5 cases lasted > 3 d. Other symptoms included cough (n=14, 45%), fatigue (n=3, 10%) and diarrhea (n=3, 9%). Pharyngalgia, runny nose, dizziness, headache and vomiting were rare. In the early stage, the total leukocytes count in peripheral blood decreased in 2 cases (6%), the lymphocytes count decreased in 2 cases (6%), and the platelet count increased in 2 cases (6%).Elevation of C-reactive protein (10%, 3/30), erythrocyte sedimentation rate(19%,4/21), procalcitonin(4%,1/28), liver enzyme(22%, 6/27) and muscle enzyme (15%, 4/27) occurred in different proportions. Renal function and blood glucose were normal. There were abnormal chest CT changes in 14 cases, including 9 cases with patchy ground glass opacities and nodules, mostly located in the lower lobe of both lungs near the pleural area. After receiving supportive treatment, the viral nucleic acid turned negative in 25 cases within 7-23 days. Among them, 24 children (77%) recovered and were discharged from hospital. No death occurred. Conclusions: In this case series, 2019-nCoV infections in children from six provinces (autonomous region) in northern China are mainly caused by close family contact. Clinical types are asymptomatic, mild and common types. Clinical manifestations and laboratory examination results are nonspecific. Close contact history of epidemiology, nucleic acid detection and chest imaging are important bases for diagnosis. After general treatment, the short-term prognosis is good.","Wang, D | Ju, X L | Xie, F | Lu, Y | Li, F Y | Huang, H H | Fang, X L | Li, Y J | Wang, J Y | Yi, B | Yue, J X | Wang, J | Wang, L X | Li, B | Wang, Y | Qiu, B P | Zhou, Z Y | Li, K L | Sun, J H | Liu, X G | Li, G D | Wang, Y J | Cao, A H | Chen, Y N",Wang D | Ju XL | Xie F | Lu Y | Li FY | Huang HH | Fang XL | Li YJ | Wang JY | Yi B | Yue JX | Wang J | Wang LX | Li B | Wang Y | Qiu BP | Zhou ZY | Li KL | Sun JH | Liu XG | Li GD | Wang YJ | Cao AH | Chen YN,"Department of Pediatric Internal Medicine, XI'an Children's Hospital, Xi'an 710003, China. | Department of Pediatric, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China. | Department of Pediatric, Department of Pediatrics, General Hospital of Ningxia University, Yinchuan 750004, China. | Department of Pediatric, the Fourth People's Hospital of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Yinchuan 750000, China. | Department of Intensive Care Unit, Xi'an eighth hospital, Xi'an 710065, China. | Department of Infectious Diseases, Ankang Central Hospital, Ankang 725000, China. | Department of Pediatric, Tongchuan Mining Bureau Central Hospital, Tongchuan 727000, China. | Department of Respiratory Medicine, Yan'an Second People's Hospital Affiliated to Yan'an University, Yan'an 716000, China. | Department of Infectious Diseases, Lanzhou Pulmonology Hospital, Lanzhou 730046, China. | Department of Pediatric, Gansu Provincial Maternity and Child-Care Hospital, Lanzhou 730050, China. | Department of Pediatric, Xianyang Central Hospital, Xianyang 712000, China. | Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children's Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450018, China. | Department of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine, Zhumadian Center Hospital, Zhumadian 463000, China. | Department of Pediatric, Shijiazhuang Fifth Hospital, Shijiazhuang 050024, China. | Department of Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, the Affiliated Children's Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710003, China. | Department of Pediatric, Tengzhou Central People's Hospital, Tengzhou 277500, China. | Department of Pediatrics, Heze Municipal Hospital, Heze 274000, China. | Department of Pediatric , People's Hospital of Rizhao, Rizhao 276800, China. | Department of Infectious Diseases, Yantai Laiyang Central Hospital, Yantai 264000, China. | Department of Pediatric , Weihai Municipal Hospital, Weihai 264200, China. | Department of Infectious Diseases, People's Hospital of Pingliang City, Pingliang 744000, China. | Department of Pediatric, Xianyang Central Hospital, Xianyang 712000, China. | Department of Pediatric, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China. | Department of Pediatric Internal Medicine, XI'an Children's Hospital, Xi'an 710003, China.",chi,English Abstract | Journal Article,20200302,China,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,0417427,IM,NOTNLM,2019 novel coronavirus | Child | Disease attributes,2020/03/03 06:00,2020/03/03 06:00,2020/03/03 06:00,2020/03/03 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/03 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/03 06:00 [medline],10.3760/cma.j.cn112140-20200225-00138 [doi],aheadofprint,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi. 2020 Mar 2;58(4):E011. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112140-20200225-00138.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Based on the susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartment model and the assumption that the infectious cases with symptoms occurred before 26 January, 2020 are resulted from free propagation without intervention, we estimate the basic reproduction number of 2019-nCoV according to the reported confirmed cases and suspected cases, as well as the theoretical estimated number of infected cases by other research teams, together with some epidemiological determinants learned from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). RESULTS: The basic reproduction number fall between 2.8 and 3.3 by using the real-time reports on the number of 2019-nCoV-infected cases from People's Daily in China and fall between 3.2 and 3.9 on the basis of the predicted number of infected cases from international colleagues. CONCLUSIONS: The early transmission ability of 2019-nCoV is close to or slightly higher than SARS. It is a controllable disease with moderate to high transmissibility. Timely and effective control measures are needed to prevent the further transmissions.","Zhou, Tao | Liu, Quanhui | Yang, Zimo | Liao, Jingyi | Yang, Kexin | Bai, Wei | Lu, Xin | Zhang, Wei",Zhou T | Liu Q | Yang Z | Liao J | Yang K | Bai W | Lu X | Zhang W,"Big Data Research Center, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, 611731, China. | College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610065, China. | Beijing AiQiYi Science & Technology Co.

Combination of Ribavirin and interferon-α is recommended by the 5(th) edition National Health Commission's Regimen (Revised Edition) because of the effect on Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the effectiveness of Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Remdisivir needs to be confirmed by randomized controlled trial (RCT), given the situation of no specific antivirus drug on NCP is unavailable. Systemic glucocorticosteroid is recommended as a short term use (1~2 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1), 3~5 d) by the 5(th) edition National Health Commission's Regimen (Revised Edition) yet RCTs are expected to confirm the effectiveness.

There were 297 family clusters (79%), case median 4; 39 clusters of dining (10%), case median 5; 23 clusters of shopping malls or supermarkets (6%), case median 13; 12 clusters of work units (3%), case median 6, and 6 clusters of transportation. We selected 325 cases to estimate the incubation period and found its range is 1 to 20 days, median was 7 days, and mode was 4 days. The analysis of the epidemic situation in a department store in China indicates that there is a possibility of patients as the source of infection during the incubation period of the epidemic. From February 5, 2020 to February 21, 2020, 634 persons were infected in the Diamond Princess Liner. All persons are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. The older, patients during the incubation period and the worse environment may be the cause of the cases rising. The progress of the two typical outbreaks clearly demonstrates the spread of the early cases in Wuhan. Whatever happens, screening and isolating close contacts remains essential except for clinical treatment during the epidemic.

In future, when combating with novel infectious diseases and public health emergencies, the response capacity of public health system and treatment capacity of clinical system will be significantly improved, while the situation on insufficient integration of prevention and treatment is bound to be reversed.","Tao, F B",Tao FB,"Department of Maternal, Child and Adolescent Health, School of Public Health, Anhui Medical University/Population Health Across Life Cycle, Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China/ Key Laboratory of Study on Abnormal Gametes and Reproductive Tract, National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China , Hefei 230032, China.",chi,English Abstract | Journal Article,20200308,China,Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi [Chinese journal of preventive medicine],7904962,IM,NOTNLM,"COVID-19 | Education, medical | Public health",2020/03/09 06:00,2020/03/09 06:00,2020/03/09 06:00,2020/03/09 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/09 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/09 06:00 [medline],10.3760/cma.j.cn112150-20200304-00246 [doi],aheadofprint,Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2020 Mar 8;54(0):E024. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112150-20200304-00246.,,YJGG202001/Anhui Medical University Emergency Key Research Project for Coronavirus Disease 2019/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Baseline demographics and clinicopathological data of eligible patients were retrieved from medical records. Information of clinical manifestations, history of epidemiology, lab tests and chest CT scan images of visiting patients from February 13 to February 28 were collected. Literatures about pulmonary infiltrates in cancer patients were searched from databases including PUBMED, EMBASE and CNKI. Results: Among the 139 cancer patients underwent chest CT scans before chemotherapy, pulmonary infiltrates were identified in eight patients (5.8%), five of whom were characterized as GGOs in lungs. 2019-nCoV nuclear acid testing was performed in three patients and the results were negative. One case was a 66-year-old man diagnosed as non-Hodgkin lymphoma and underwent CHOP chemotherapy regimen. His chest CT scan image displayed multiple GGOs in lungs and the complete blood count showed decreased lymphocytes. This patient denied any contact with confirmed/suspected cases of 2019-nCoV infection and without fever and other respiratory symptoms. Considering the negative result of nuclear acid testing, this patient was presumptively diagnosed as viral pneumonia and an experiential anti-infection treatment had been prescribed for him. Conclusions: The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) complicates the clinical scenario of pulmonary infiltrates in cancer patients. The epidemic history, clinical manifestation, CT scan image and lab test should be combined consideration. The 2019-nCoV nuclear acid testing might be applicated in more selected patients. Active anti-infection treatment and surveillance of patient condition should be initiated if infectious disease is considered.","Zhu, W J | Wang, J | He, X H | Qin, Y | Yang, S | Hu, X S | Wang, H Y | Huang, J | Zhou, A P | Ma, F | Shi, Y K | Zhou, S Y",Zhu WJ | Wang J | He XH | Qin Y | Yang S | Hu XS | Wang HY | Huang J | Zhou AP | Ma F | Shi YK | Zhou SY,"Department of Comprehensive Oncology, National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100021, China. | Department of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100021, China. | Department of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100021, China. | Department of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100021, China. | Department of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100021, China. | Department of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100021, China. | Department of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100021, China. | Department of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100021, China. | Department of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100021, China. | Department of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100021, China. | Department of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100021, China. | Department of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100021, China.",chi,English Abstract | Journal Article,20200305,China,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi,Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology],7910681,IM,NOTNLM,COVID-19 | Drug-induced pulmonary injury | Neoplasm | Pulmonary infiltrates | Viral pneumonia,2020/03/07 06:00,2020/03/07 06:00,2020/03/06 06:00,2020/03/06 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/07 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/07 06:00 [medline],10.3760/cma.j.cn112152-20200303-00166 [doi],aheadofprint,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi. 2020 Mar 5;42(0):E008. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112152-20200303-00166.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This pandemic disease has now been defined as novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and is sustained by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As the current gold standard for the etiological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is (real time) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on respiratory tract specimens, the diagnostic accuracy of this technique shall be considered a foremost prerequisite. Overall, potential RT-PCR vulnerabilities include general preanalytical issues such as identification problems, inadequate procedures for collection, handling, transport and storage of the swabs, collection of inappropriate or inadequate material (for quality or volume), presence of interfering substances, manual errors, as well as specific aspects such as sample contamination and testing patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. Some analytical problems may also contribute to jeopardize the diagnostic accuracy, including testing outside the diagnostic window, active viral recombination, use of inadequately validated assays, insufficient harmonization, instrument malfunctioning, along with other specific technical issues. Some practical indications can hence be identified for minimizing the risk of diagnostic errors, encompassing the improvement of diagnostic accuracy by combining clinical evidence with results of chest computed tomography (CT) and RT-PCR, interpretation of RT-PCR results according to epidemiologic, clinical and radiological factors, recollection and testing of upper (or lower) respiratory specimens in patients with negative RT-PCR test results and high suspicion or probability of infection, dissemination of clear instructions for specimen (especially swab) collection, management and storage, together with refinement of molecular target(s) and thorough compliance with analytical procedures, including quality assurance.","Lippi, Giuseppe | Simundic, Ana-Maria | Plebani, Mario",Lippi G | Simundic AM | Plebani M,"Section of Clinical Biochemistry, Department of Neuroscience, Biomedicine and Movement, University of Verona, Piazzale LA Scuro, 37134 Verona, Italy. | Department of Medical Laboratory Diagnostics, University Hospital Sveti Duh, Zagreb, Croatia. | Department of Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital of Padova, Padova, Italy.",eng,Journal Article,20200316,Germany,Clin Chem Lab Med,Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,9806306,IM,NOTNLM,COVID-19 | coronavirus | diagnosis | reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR),2020/03/17 06:00,2020/03/17 06:00,2020/03/16 06:00,2020/03/09 00:00 [received] | 2020/03/10 00:00 [accepted] | 2020/03/16 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/17 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/17 06:00 [medline],/j/cclm.ahead-of-print/cclm-2020-0285/cclm-2020-0285.xml [pii] | 10.1515/cclm-2020-0285 [doi],aheadofprint,Clin Chem Lab Med. 2020 Mar 16:/j/cclm.ahead-of-print/cclm-2020-0285/cclm-2020-0285.xml. doi: 10.1515/cclm-2020-0285.,,,,,ORCID: 0000-0002-0270-1711,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This put enormous pressure on the Chinese government, medical healthcare provider, and the general public, but also made the international community deeply nervous. On the 25th day after the outbreak, the Chinese government implemented strict traffic restrictions on the area where the 2019-nCoV had originated-Hubei province, whose capital city is Wuhan. Ten days later, the rate of increase of cases in Hubei showed a significant difference (p = 0.0001) compared with the total rate of increase in other provinces of China. These preliminary data suggest the effectiveness of a traffic restriction policy for this pandemic thus far. At the same time, solid financial support and improved research ability, along with network communication technology, also greatly facilitated the application of epidemic prevention measures. These measures were motivated by the need to provide effective treatment of patients, and involved consultation with three major groups in policy formulation-public health experts, the government, and the general public. It was also aided by media and information technology, as well as international cooperation.

Chinese authorities and health agencies had devoted great efforts to control this disease. As surgeons specialized in the treatment of gastrointestinal tumors, we should always be aware of the prevention for NCP and incorporate this awareness into every detail of clinical practice. For the patients with gastrointestinal tumors, pre-admission screening should be done in order to rule out NCP. Real-time RT-PCR panel and chest CT scan should be conducted for patients with fever (>37.3℃), travel history to Hubei Province within 14 days, or contact history with residents from Wuhan district within 14 days. Prevention measures for both medical staffs and the screen-negative admitted patients should also be enhanced because false negative is possible. Medical instruments should be properly discarded or disinfected according to standardized procedures established by the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC). Surgical operation should be reduced at a minimal level to prevent cross infection in this special period.Surgical intervention for benign tumor should be postponed. For malignant tumor, multidisciplinary therapy (MDT) is recommended and non-surgical anti-tumor therapy should be selected with higher priority. Neoadjuvant therapy is highly recommended for gastrointestinal cancer at advanced stages that meet the indications of NCCN guideline (gastric cancer T stage ≥ 2/rectal cancer T stage ≥ 3/unresectable colon cancer). Gastric or esophagogastricjunction (EGJ) malignant tumor with obstruction can be managed with gastric tube decompression or stent placement to relieve the symptoms. Transnasal enteral feeding tube intubation/percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy could be adopted to ensure enteral nutrition supply. For colorectal malignancy with simple intestinal obstruction, stent placement can achieve a high success rate, which not only helps avoid emergency surgery, but also creates a better condition for subsequent surgery. Transcatheter arterial embolization for hemostasis is an alternative choice for gastrointestinal tumor with bleeding. However, emergency operation still must be performed for patients with acute uncontrolled bleeding, obstruction or after other alternative treatment measures fail. All cases with suspicious or confirmed with NCP must be reported to the local CDC department. All invasive intervention must be performed in a designated isolation area. Tertiary prevention measure must be adopted for all anesthetists with additional face mask or medical goggle protection to prevent respiratory droplet transmission. Preventive enterostomy is preferable in lower digestive tract surgery. Thoroughly disinfecting the operating room after surgery is necessary. Fever after surgery must be carefully differentiated whether it's caused by post-surgery abdominal infection/inflammation or NCP. Single-room isolation and related examinations should be performed according to the standard procedures. We believe that with the unprecedentedly joint efforts of doctors and patients, we will eventually win this war against NCP. | World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Human infection with SARS-CoV-2 leads to a wide range of clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic, mild, moderate to severe. The severe cases present with pneumonia, which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The outbreak provides an opportunity for real-time tracking of an animal coronavirus that has just crossed species barrier to infect humans. The outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection is largely determined by virus-host interaction. Here, we review the discovery, zoonotic origin, animal hosts, transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in relation to its interplay with host antiviral defense. A comparison with SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, community-acquired human coronaviruses and other pathogenic viruses including human immunodeficiency viruses is made. We summarize current understanding of the induction of a proinflammatory cytokine storm by other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, their adaptation to humans and their usurpation of the cell death programmes. Important questions concerning the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and host antiviral defence, including asymptomatic and presymptomatic virus shedding, are also discussed.","Chen, Y H | Peng, J S | Fung, Sin-Yee | Yuen, Kit-San | Ye, Zi-Wei | Chan, Chi-Ping | Jin, Dong-Yan",Chen YH | Peng JS | Fung SY | Yuen KS | Ye ZW | Chan CP | Jin DY,"Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510655, China. | School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong. | School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong. | Department of Microbiology, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong. | School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong. | School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong.",chi | eng,Journal Article | Journal Article | Review,,China | United States,Zhonghua Wei Chang Wai Ke Za Zhi | Emerg Microbes Infect,Zhonghua wei chang wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of gastrointestinal surgery | Emerging microbes & infections,101177990 | 101594885,IM | IM,NOTNLM | NOTNLM,"Gastrointestinal tumor, treatment strategy | Multidisciplinary therapy | Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) | 2019 novel coronavirus | COVID-19 | Coronavirus | SARS-CoV | SARS-CoV-2 | host antiviral response | type I interferon",2020/02/23 06:00 | 2020/03/17 06:00,2020/03/13 06:00 | 2020/03/17 06:00,2020/02/20 06:00 | 2020/03/17 06:00,2020/02/20 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/13 06:00 [medline] | 2020/03/17 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/17 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/17 06:00 [medline],10.3760/cma.j.issn.1671-0274.2020.02.001 [doi] | 10.1080/22221751.2020.1736644 [doi],ppublish | ppublish,Zhonghua Wei Chang Wai Ke Za Zhi. 2020 Feb 25;23(2):I-IV. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.1671-0274.2020.02.001. | Emerg Microbes Infect. 2020 Dec;9(1):558-570. doi: 10.1080/22221751.2020.1736644.,,,,20200312 | 20200317,ORCID: 0000-0002-1394-7709 | ORCID: 0000-0001-6876-0864 | ORCID: 0000-0002-2778-3530,0 (COVID-19) | txid2697049 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2),,"China | *Coronavirus | Coronavirus Infections/*diagnosis/prevention & control | Disease Outbreaks | Humans | Mass Screening | Pneumonia, Viral/*diagnosis/prevention & control | Rectal Neoplasms/*therapy/virology | Animals | Betacoronavirus/isolation & purification/*physiology | Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology/prevention & control/transmission/*virology | Disease Vectors | *Host-Pathogen Interactions | Humans | Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology/prevention & control/transmission/*virology",,,,,,,,,,,,

During the epidemic period, cancer patients with low immunity levels face the double ordeals of disease and epidemic situation. Compared with the general population, they are more likely to be infected with the new coronavirus. Among the infected cancer patients, lung cancer is the most common type. It is necessary to provide more appropriate individualized treatment recommendations for patients with lung cancer based on the epidemic situation of the patient's location and in combination with the patient's own condition. Through active prevention of infection, timely conversion of treatment strategies, online and offline joint control, and positive psychological counseling, we significantly hope to help patients with lung cancer to survive this difficult period.","Zhao, Z | Bai, H | Duan, J C | Wang, J",Zhao Z | Bai H | Duan JC | Wang J,"Department of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100021, China.",chi,English Abstract | Journal Article,20200303,China,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi,Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology],7910681,IM,NOTNLM,COVID-19 | Individualized treatment | Lung neoplasms,2020/03/04 06:00,2020/03/04 06:00,2020/03/04 06:00,2020/03/04 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/04 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/04 06:00 [medline],10.3760/cma.j.cn112152-20200228-00146 [doi],aheadofprint,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi. 2020 Mar 3;42(0):E007. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112152-20200228-00146.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is an emerging enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes serious vomiting and diarrhea in suckling piglets. In this study, the role of Ca(2+) to PDCoV infection was investigated. PDCoV infection was found to upregulate intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations of IPI-2I cells. Chelating extracellular Ca(2+) by EGTA inhibited PDCoV replication, and this inhibitory effect was overcome by replenishment with CaCl(2). Treatment with Ca(2+) channel blockers, particularly the L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker diltiazem hydrochloride, inhibited PDCoV infection significantly. Mechanistically, diltiazem hydrochloride reduces PDCoV infection by inhibiting the replication step of the viral replication cycle. Additionally, knockdown of CACNA1S, the L-type Ca(2+) voltage-gated channel subunit, inhibited PDCoV replication. The combined results demonstrate that PDCoV modulates calcium influx to favor its replication.","Bai, Dongcheng | Fang, Liurong | Xia, Sijin | Ke, Wenting | Wang, Jing | Wu, Xiaoli | Fang, Puxian | Xiao, Shaobo",Bai D | Fang L | Xia S | Ke W | Wang J | Wu X | Fang P | Xiao S,"State Key Laboratory of Agricultural Microbiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China; Key Laboratory of Preventive Veterinary Medicine in Hubei Province, The Cooperative Innovation Center for Sustainable Pig Production, Wuhan, 430070, China. | State Key Laboratory of Agricultural Microbiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China; Key Laboratory of Preventive Veterinary Medicine in Hubei Province, The Cooperative Innovation Center for Sustainable Pig Production, Wuhan, 430070, China.

In this case report, we aim to define the chest computed tomography findings of 2019-novel coronavirus associated with pneumonia and its successful resolution after treatment. CASE REPORT: A fifty-year-old female patient, who is a businesswoman, presented with chief complaints of “fever for one week, diarrhea, anorexia, and asthenia.” Initially, she was given Tamiflu. The influenza A virus serology was negative. Three days later, levofloxacin was started because the patient’s symptoms did not improve. The novel coronavirus nucleic acid test was negative. It was noted that before the onset of the disease, the patient went to Wuhan on a business trip. Despite the given treatment, her body temperature rose to 39.2°C and she was referred to our clinic for further evaluation. Then, chest computed tomography was performed and showed bilateral multifocal ground glass opacities with consolidation which suggested viral pneumonia as a differential diagnosis, and the subsequent 2019-novel coronavirus pneumonia nucleic acid test was positive. CONCLUSION: Chest computed tomography offers fast and convenient evaluation of patients with suspected 2019-novel coronavirus pneumonia.","An, Peng | Song, Ping | Lian, Kai | Wang, Yong",An P | Song P | Lian K | Wang Y,"Department of Radiology, Xiangyang First People’s Hospital Affiliated to Hubei Medical College, Hubei, China | Department of Infectious Disease and Respiratory and Critical Care, Xiangyang First People’s Hospital Affiliated to Hubei Medical College, Hubei, China | Department of Radiology, Xiangyang First People’s Hospital Affiliated to Hubei Medical College, Hubei, China | Department of Infectious Disease and Respiratory and Critical Care, Xiangyang First People’s Hospital Affiliated to Hubei Medical College, Hubei, China | Department of Radiology, Xiangyang First People’s Hospital Affiliated to Hubei Medical College, Hubei, China",eng,Journal Article,20200306,Turkey,Balkan Med J,Balkan medical journal,101571817,,NOTNLM,*Diagnosis | *influenza | *novel coronavirus pneumonia | *pulmonary complications,2020/03/12 06:00,2020/03/12 06:00,2020/03/12 06:00,2020/03/12 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/12 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/12 06:00 [medline],10.4274/balkanmedj.galenos.2020.2020.2.15 [doi],aheadofprint,Balkan Med J. 2020 Mar 6. doi: 10.4274/balkanmedj.galenos.2020.2020.2.15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Related clinical features are needed. METHODS: We reviewed 69 patients who were hospitalized in Union hospital in Wuhan between January 16 to January 29, 2020. All patients were confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the final date of follow-up was February 4, 2020. RESULTS: The median age of 69 enrolled patients was 42.0 years (IQR 35.0-62.0), and 32 patients (46%) were men. The most common symptoms were fever (60[87%]), cough (38[55%]), and fatigue (29[42%]). Most patients received antiviral therapy (66 [98.5%] of 67 patients) and antibiotic therapy (66 [98.5%] of 67 patients). As of February 4, 2020, 18 (26.9%) of 67 patients had been discharged, and five patients had died, with a mortality rate of 7.5%. According to the lowest SpO2 during admission, cases were divided into the SpO2≥90% group (n=55) and the SpO2<90% group (n=14). All 5 deaths occurred in the SpO2<90% group. Compared with SpO2≥90% group, patients of the SpO2<90% group were older, and showed more comorbidities and higher plasma levels of IL6, IL10, lactate dehydrogenase, and c reactive protein. Arbidol treatment showed tendency to improve the discharging rate and decrease the mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 appears to show frequent fever, dry cough, and increase of inflammatory cytokines, and induced a mortality rate of 7.5%. Older patients or those with underlying comorbidities are at higher risk of death.","Wang, Zhongliang | Yang, Bohan | Li, Qianwen | Wen, Lu | Zhang, Ruiguang",Wang Z | Yang B | Li Q | Wen L | Zhang R,"Cancer Center, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. | Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. | Cancer Center, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. | Cancer Center, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. | Cancer Center, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.",eng,Journal Article,20200316,United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,IM,NOTNLM,Wuhan | coronavirus | pneumonia,2020/03/17 06:00,2020/03/17 06:00,2020/03/17 06:00,2020/02/17 00:00 [received] | 2020/03/17 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/03/17 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/03/17 06:00 [medline],5807944 [pii] | 10.1093/cid/ciaa272 [doi],aheadofprint,Clin Infect Dis. 2020 Mar 16:ciaa272. doi: 10.1093/cid/ciaa272.,"© The Author(s) 2020.

The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is the only IgG transport receptor, its expression on mucosal surfaces is triggered upon viral stimulation, which significantly enhances mucosal immunity. We utilized TGEV as a model pathogen to explore the role of FcRn in resisting viral invasion in overall intestinal mucosal immunity. TGEV induced FcRn expression by activating NF-κB signaling in porcine small intestinal epithelial (IPEC-J2) cells, however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. First, using small interfering RNAs, we found that TGEV up-regulated FcRn expression via TLR3, TLR9 and RIG-I. Moreover, TGEV induced IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TGF-β, and TNF-α production. TGF-β-stimulated IPEC-J2 cells highly up-regulated FcRn expression, while treatment with a JNK-specific inhibitor down-regulated the expression. TGEV nucleocapsid (N) protein also enhanced FcRn promoter activity via the NF-κB signaling pathway and its central region (aa 128-252) was essential for FcRn activation. Additionally, N protein-mediated FcRn up-regulation promotes IgG transcytosis. Thus, TGEV N protein and TGF-β up-regulated FcRn expression, further clarifying the molecular mechanism of up-regulation of FcRn expression by TGEV.","Qian, Shaoju | Gao, Zitong | Cao, Rui | Yang, Kang | Cui, Yijie | Li, Shaowen | Meng, Xianrong | He, Qigai | Li, Zili",Qian S | Gao Z | Cao R | Yang K | Cui Y | Li S | Meng X | He Q | Li Z,"State Key Laboratory of Agricultural Microbiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China. | State Key Laboratory of Agricultural Microbiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China. | State Key Laboratory of Agricultural Microbiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China. | State Key Laboratory of Agricultural Microbiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China. | State Key Laboratory of Agricultural Microbiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China. | State Key Laboratory of Agricultural Microbiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China. | Key Laboratory of Preventive Veterinary Medicine in Hubei Province, The Cooperative Innovation Center for Sustainable Pig Production, Wuhan, China. | Key Laboratory of Development of Veterinary Diagnostic Products, Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China, Wuhan, China. | State Key Laboratory of Agricultural Microbiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China. | Key Laboratory of Preventive Veterinary Medicine in Hubei Province, The Cooperative Innovation Center for Sustainable Pig Production, Wuhan, China. | Key Laboratory of Development of Veterinary Diagnostic Products, Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China, Wuhan, China. | State Key Laboratory of Agricultural Microbiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China. | Key Laboratory of Preventive Veterinary Medicine in Hubei Province, The Cooperative Innovation Center for Sustainable Pig Production, Wuhan, China. | Key Laboratory of Development of Veterinary Diagnostic Products, Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China, Wuhan, China. | State Key Laboratory of Agricultural Microbiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China. | Key Laboratory of Preventive Veterinary Medicine in Hubei Province, The Cooperative Innovation Center for Sustainable Pig Production, Wuhan, China. | Key Laboratory of Development of Veterinary Diagnostic Products, Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China, Wuhan, China.",eng,Journal Article,20200121,,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,,NOTNLM,NF-κB | TGF-β | neonatal Fc receptor | nucleocapsid protein | toll-like receptor | transmissible gastroenteritis virus,2020/02/11 06:00,2020/02/11 06:01,2020/02/11 06:00,2019/10/14 00:00 [received] | 2019/12/20 00:00 [accepted] | 2020/02/11 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/02/11 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/02/11 06:01 [medline],10.3389/fmicb.2019.03085 [doi],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2020 Jan 21;10:3085. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2019.03085. eCollection 2019.,"Copyright © 2020 Qian, Gao, Cao, Yang, Cui, Li, Meng, He and Li.",,,,,,,,PMC6990134,,,,,,,,,,,

Up to now, clinical features and treatment of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported in detail. However, the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and coagulation has been scarcely addressed. Our aim is to investigate the blood coagulation function of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods In our study, 94 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were admitted in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. We prospectively collect blood coagulation data in these patients and in 40 healthy controls during the same period. Results Antithrombin values in patients were lower than that in the control group (p < 0.001). The values of D-dimer, fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), and fibrinogen (FIB) in all SARS-CoV-2 cases were substantially higher than those in healthy controls. Moreover, D-dimer and FDP values in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection were higher than those in patients with milder forms. Compared with healthy controls, prothrombin time activity (PT-act) was lower in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Thrombin time in critical SARS-CoV-2 patients was also shorter than that in controls. Conclusions The coagulation function in patients with SARS-CoV-2 is significantly deranged compared with healthy people, but monitoring D-dimer and FDP values may be helpful for the early identification of severe cases.","Han, Huan | Yang, Lan | Liu, Rui | Liu, Fang | Wu, Kai-Lang | Li, Jie | Liu, Xing-Hui | Zhu, Cheng-Liang",Han H | Yang L | Liu R | Liu F | Wu KL | Li J | Liu XH | Zhu CL,"Department of Clinical Laboratory, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, P.R.

Methods: Consecutively confirmed novel coronavirus infection cases admitted to seven designated hospitals during January 23, 2020 to February 8, 2020 were included. Clinical classification (mild, moderate, severe, and critical) was carried out according to the diagnosis and treatment program of novel coronavirus pneumonia (Trial Fifth Edition) issued by the National Health Commission. The research data were analyzed using SPSS19.0 statistical software. Quantitative data were expressed as median (interquartile range), and qualitative data were expressed as frequency and rate. Results: 32 confirmed cases that met the inclusion criteria were included. 28 cases were of mild or moderate type (87.50%), and four cases (12.50%) of severe or critical type. Four cases (12.5%) were combined with one underlying disease (bronchial asthma, coronary heart disease, malignant tumor, chronic kidney disease), and one case (3.13%) was simultaneously combined with high blood pressure and malignant tumor. The results of laboratory examination showed that the alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin (ALB), and total bilirubin (TBil) for entire cohort were 26.98 (16.88 ~ 46.09) U/L and 24.75 (18.71 ~ 31.79) U/L, 39.00 (36.20 ~ 44.20) g/L and 16.40 (11.34- ~ 21.15) mmol/L, respectively. ALT, AST, ALB and TBil of the mild or moderate subgroups were 22.75 (16.31- ~ 37.25) U/L, 23.63 (18.71 ~ 26.50) U/L, 39.70 (36.50 ~ 46.10) g/L, and 15.95 (11.34 ~ 20.83) mmol/L, respectively. ALT, AST, ALB and TBil of the severe or critical subgroups were 60.25 (40.88 ~ 68.90) U/L, 37.00 (20.88 ~ 64.45) U/L, 35.75 (28.68 ~ 42.00) g/L, and 20.50 (11.28 ~ 25.00) mmol/L, respectively. Conclusion: The results of this multicenter retrospective study suggests that novel coronavirus pneumonia combined with liver damage is more likely to be caused by adverse drug reactions and systemic inflammation in severe patients receiving medical treatment. Therefore, liver function monitoring and evaluation should be strengthened during the treatment of such patients.","Liu, C | Jiang, Z C | Shao, C X | Zhang, H G | Yue, H M | Chen, Z H | Ma, B Y | Liu, W Y | Huang, H H | Yang, J | Wang, Y | Liu, H Y | Xu, D | Wang, J T | Yang, J Y | Pan, H Q | Zou, S Q | Li, F J | Lei, J Q | Li, X | He, Q | Gu, Y | Qi, X L",Liu C | Jiang ZC | Shao CX | Zhang HG | Yue HM | Chen ZH | Ma BY | Liu WY | Huang HH | Yang J | Wang Y | Liu HY | Xu D | Wang JT | Yang JY | Pan HQ | Zou SQ | Li FJ | Lei JQ | Li X | He Q | Gu Y | Qi XL,"COVID-19 study group, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China. | COVID-19 study group, Ankang Central Hospital, Ankang 725000, China. | COVID-19 study group, Lishui Central Hospital, Lishui 323000, China. | COVID-19 study group, The Affiliated Third Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang 212021, China. | Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China. | COVID-19 study group, The People's Hospital of Baoding, Baoding 071000, China. | COVID-19 study group, The People's Hospital of LinXia Hui Prefecture, Linxia 731100, China. | COVID-19 study group, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China. | COVID-19 study group, Ankang Central Hospital, Ankang 725000, China. | COVID-19 study group, Lishui Central Hospital, Lishui 323000, China. | COVID-19 study group, The Sixth People's Hospital of Shenyang, Shenyang 110006, China. | COVID-19 study group, The Sixth People's Hospital of Shenyang, Shenyang 110006, China. | COVID-19 study group, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China. | COVID-19 study group, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China. | COVID-19 study group, The Sixth People's Hospital of Shenyang, Shenyang 110006, China. | COVID-19 study group, The Affiliated Third Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang 212021, China. | COVID-19 study group, The Affiliated Third Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang 212021, China. | COVID-19 study group, The People's Hospital of Baoding, Baoding 071000, China. | COVID-19 study group, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China. | COVID-19 study group, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China. | COVID-19 study group, The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518100, China. | COVID-19 study group, The Sixth People's Hospital of Shenyang, Shenyang 110006, China. | COVID-19 study group, The First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China.",chi,English Abstract | Journal Article,20200220,China,Zhonghua Gan Zang Bing Za Zhi,Zhonghua gan zang bing za zhi = Zhonghua ganzangbing zazhi = Chinese journal of hepatology,9710009,IM,NOTNLM,Clinical typing | Hypohepatia | Liver function | NCP,2020/02/23 06:00,2020/02/23 06:00,2020/02/21 06:00,2020/02/21 06:00 [entrez] | 2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed] | 2020/02/23 06:00 [medline],10.3760/cma.j.issn.1007-3418.2020.02.003 [doi],aheadofprint,Zhonghua Gan Zang Bing Za Zhi. 2020 Feb 20;28(2):148-152. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.1007-3418.2020.02.003.,,YJ2020-9-009/Shenyang Emergency Research Project for Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19/ | 2020-YJ005/Shanxi Provincial Emergency Research Project for Chinese Medicine for Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19/ | SH2020001/Zhenjiang Key Research and Development Plan for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Project/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
