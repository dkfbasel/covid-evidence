AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus is spreading rapidly, and scientists 
      are endeavoring to discover drugs for its efficacious treatment in China. 
      Chloroquine phosphate, an old drug for treatment of malaria, is shown to have 
      apparent efficacy and acceptable safety against COVID-19 associated pneumonia in 
      multicenter clinical trials conducted in China. The drug is recommended to be 
      included in the next version of the Guidelines for the Prevention, Diagnosis, and 
      Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission 
      of the People's Republic of China for treatment of COVID-19 infection in larger 
      populations in the future.

AB  - Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-COV2 and represents the causative 
      agent of a potentially fatal disease that is of great global public health concern. 
      Based on the large number of infected people that were exposed to the wet animal 
      market in Wuhan City, China, it is suggested that this is likely the zoonotic origin 
      of COVID-19. Person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 infection led to the 
      isolation of patients that were subsequently administered a variety of treatments. 
      Extensive measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 have been 
      implemented to control the current outbreak. Special attention and efforts to 
      protect or reduce transmission should be applied in susceptible populations 
      including children, health care providers, and elderly people. In this review, we 
      highlights the symptoms, epidemiology, transmission, pathogenesis, phylogenetic 
      analysis and future directions to control the spread of this fatal disease.

AB  - Since mid-December of 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection has been 
      spreading from Wuhan, China. The confirmed COVID-19 patients in South Korea are 
      those who came from or visited China. As secondary transmissions have occurred and 
      the speed of transmission is accelerating, there are rising concerns about community 
      infections. The 54-year old male is the third patient diagnosed with COVID-19 
      infection in Korea. He is a worker for a clothing business and had mild respiratory 
      symptoms and intermittent fever in the beginning of hospitalization, and pneumonia 
      symptoms on chest computerized tomography scan on day 6 of admission. This patient 
      caused one case of secondary transmission and three cases of tertiary transmission. 
      Hereby, we report the clinical findings of the index patient who was the first to 
      cause tertiary transmission outside China. Interestingly, after lopinavir/ritonavir 
      (Kaletra, AbbVie) was administered, β-coronavirus viral loads significantly 
      decreased and no or little coronavirus titers were observed.

TI  - The neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV2 may be at least partially responsible for 
      the respiratory failure of COVID-19 patients.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25728 [doi]
AB  - Following the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle 
      East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), another highly pathogenic 
      coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 (previously known as 2019-nCoV) emerged in December 
      2019 in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spreads around the world. This virus shares highly 
      homological sequence with SARS-CoV, and causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with clinical symptoms similar to those reported 
      for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The most characteristic symptom of patients with COVID-19 
      is respiratory distress, and most of the patients admitted to the intensive care 
      could not breathe spontaneously. Additionally, some patients with COVID-19 also 
      showed neurologic signs, such as headache, nausea, and vomiting. Increasing evidence 
      shows that coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract and that 
      they may also invade the central nervous system inducing neurological diseases. The 
      infection of SARS-CoV has been reported in the brains from both patients and 
      experimental animals, where the brainstem was heavily infected. Furthermore, some 
      coronaviruses have been demonstrated able to spread via a synapse-connected route to 
      the medullary cardiorespiratory center from the mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors 
      in the lung and lower respiratory airways. In light of the high similarity between 
      SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2, it is quite likely that the potential invasion of SARS-CoV2 
      is partially responsible for the acute respiratory failure of patients with 
      COVID-19. Awareness of this will have important guiding significance for the 
      prevention and treatment of the SARS-CoV-2-induced respiratory failure.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged in December 2019 and then spread rapidly worldwide, 
      particularly to China, Japan, and South Korea. Scientists are endeavoring to find 
      antivirals specific to the virus. Several drugs such as chloroquine, arbidol, 
      remdesivir, and favipiravir are currently undergoing clinical studies to test their 
      efficacy and safety in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 
      China; some promising results have been achieved thus far. This article summarizes 
      agents with potential efficacy against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cause china epidemics 
      with high morbidity and mortality, the infection has been transmitted to other 
      countries. About three neonates and more than 230 children cases are reported. The 
      disease condition of the main children was mild. There is currently no evidence that 
      SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted transplacentally from mother to the newborn. The 
      treatment strategy for children with Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is based on 
      adult experience. Thus far, no deaths have been reported in the pediatric age group. 
      This review describes the current understanding of COVID-19 infection in newborns 
      and children.

AB  - Since December 2019, unexplained pneumonia has appeared in Wuhan City, Hubei 
      Province, and a new type of coronavirus infection was confirmed as COVID-19. 
      COVID-19 spread rapidly nationwide and abroad. The COVID-19 has brought huge impacts 
      to all the people and walks of life, especially to the medical and health systems. 
      It has also brought great challenges to the treatment of patients with cancer. 
      Esophageal cancer is a common malignant tumor in China and most of the patients are 
      in the middle and advanced stage when diagnosed, with immunosuppressive and poor 
      prognosis. The selection of surgical procedures and perioperative managements of 
      esophageal cancer require all thoracic surgeons work together to figure out a 
      reasonable system of surgical treatment and emergency response.

TI  - Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Role of Chest CT in Diagnosis and Management.
PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.2214/AJR.20.22954 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE. The objective of our study was to determine the misdiagnosis rate of 
      radiologists for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and evaluate the performance of 
      chest CT in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19. The CT features of COVID-19 
      are reported and compared with the CT features of other viruses to familiarize 
      radiologists with possible CT patterns. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This study included 
      the first 51 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection confirmed by nucleic 
      acid testing (23 women and 28 men; age range, 26-83 years) and two patients with 
      adenovirus (one woman and one man; ages, 58 and 66 years). We reviewed the clinical 
      information, CT images, and corresponding image reports of these 53 patients. The CT 
      images included images from 99 chest CT examinations, including initial and 
      follow-up CT studies. We compared the image reports of the initial CT study with the 
      laboratory test results and identified CT patterns suggestive of viral infection. 
      RESULTS. COVID-19 was misdiagnosed as a common infection at the initial CT study in 
      two inpatients with underlying disease and COVID-19. Viral pneumonia was correctly 
      diagnosed at the initial CT study in the remaining 49 patients with COVID-19 and two 
      patients with adenovirus. These patients were isolated and obtained treatment. 
      Ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidation with or without vascular 
      enlargement, interlobular septal thickening, and air bronchogram sign are common CT 
      features of COVID-19. The The "reversed halo" sign and pulmonary nodules with a halo 
      sign are uncommon CT features. The CT findings of COVID-19 overlap with the CT 
      findings of adenovirus infection. There are differences as well as similarities in 
      the CT features of COVID-19 compared with those of the severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome. CONCLUSION. We found that chest CT had a low rate of missed diagnosis of 
      COVID-19 (3.9%, 2/51) and may be useful as a standard method for the rapid diagnosis 
      of COVID-19 to optimize the management of patients. However, CT is still limited for 
      identifying specific viruses and distinguishing between viruses.

TI  - The SARS, MERS and novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemics, the newest and biggest 
      global health threats: what lessons have we learned?
LID - dyaa033 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ije/dyaa033 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To provide an overview of the three major deadly coronaviruses and 
      identify areas for improvement of future preparedness plans, as well as provide a 
      critical assessment of the risk factors and actionable items for stopping their 
      spread, utilizing lessons learned from the first two deadly coronavirus outbreaks, 
      as well as initial reports from the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic in 
      Wuhan, China. METHODS: Utilizing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
      (CDC, USA) website, and a comprehensive review of PubMed literature, we obtained 
      information regarding clinical signs and symptoms, treatment and diagnosis, 
      transmission methods, protection methods and risk factors for Middle East 
      Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and COVID-19. 
      Comparisons between the viruses were made. RESULTS: Inadequate risk assessment 
      regarding the urgency of the situation, and limited reporting on the virus within 
      China has, in part, led to the rapid spread of COVID-19 throughout mainland China 
      and into proximal and distant countries. Compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has 
      spread more rapidly, due in part to increased globalization and the focus of the 
      epidemic. Wuhan, China is a large hub connecting the North, South, East and West of 
      China via railways and a major international airport. The availability of connecting 
      flights, the timing of the outbreak during the Chinese (Lunar) New Year, and the 
      massive rail transit hub located in Wuhan has enabled the virus to perforate 
      throughout China, and eventually, globally. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that we did not 
      learn from the two prior epidemics of coronavirus and were ill-prepared to deal with 
      the challenges the COVID-19 epidemic has posed. Future research should attempt to 
      address the uses and implications of internet of things (IoT) technologies for 
      mapping the spread of infection.

TI  - A systematic review of lopinavir therapy for SARS coronavirus and MERS coronavirus-A 
      possible reference for coronavirus disease-19 treatment option.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25729 [doi]
AB  - In the past few decades, coronaviruses have risen as a global threat to public 
      health. Currently, the outbreak of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) from Wuhan 
      caused a worldwide panic. There are no specific antiviral therapies for COVID-19. 
      However, there are agents that were used during the severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemics. We could 
      learn from SARS and MERS. Lopinavir (LPV) is an effective agent that inhibits the 
      protease activity of coronavirus. In this review, we discuss the literature on the 
      efficacy of LPV in vitro and in vivo, especially in patients with SARS and MERS, so 
      that we might clarify the potential for the use of LPV in patients with COVID-19.

AB  - Rapidly sharing scientific information is an effective way to reduce public panic 
      about COVID-19, and doing so is the key to providing real-time guidance to 
      epidemiologists working to contain the outbreak, clinicians managing patients, and 
      modelers helping to understand future developments and the possible effectiveness of 
      various interventions. This issue has rapidly reviewed and published articles 
      describing COVID-19, including the drug treatment options for SARS-CoV-2, its 
      clinical characteristics, and therapies involving a combination of Chinese and 
      Western medicine, the efficacy of chloroquine phosphate in the treatment of COVID-19 
      associated pneumonia according to clinical studies, and reflections on the system of 
      reserve medical supplies for public health emergencies. As an academic journal, we 
      will continue to quickly and transparently share data with frontline healthcare 
      workers who need to know the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19.

AB  - In late December 2019, a previous unidentified coronavirus, currently named as the 
      2019 novel coronavirus#, emerged from Wuhan, China, and resulted in a formidable 
      outbreak in many cities in China and expanded globally, including Thailand, Republic 
      of Korea, Japan, United States, Philippines, Viet Nam, and our country (as of 
      2/6/2020 at least 25 countries). The disease is officially named as Coronavirus 
      Disease-2019 (COVID-19, by WHO on February 11, 2020). It is also named as Severe 
      Pneumonia with Novel Pathogens on January 15, 2019 by the Taiwan CDC, the Ministry 
      of Health and is a notifiable communicable disease of the fifth category. COVID-19 
      is a potential zoonotic disease with low to moderate (estimated 2%-5%) mortality 
      rate. Person-to-person transmission may occur through droplet or contact 
      transmission and if there is a lack of stringent infection control or if no proper 
      personal protective equipment available, it may jeopardize the first-line healthcare 
      workers. Currently, there is no definite treatment for COVID-19 although some drugs 
      are under investigation. To promptly identify patients and prevent further 
      spreading, physicians should be aware of the travel or contact history of the 
      patient with compatible symptoms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since the first case of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection 
      pneumonia was detected in Wuhan, China, a series of confirmed cases of the COVID-19 
      were found in Beijing. We analyzed the data of 262 confirmed cases to determine the 
      clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Beijing. METHODS: We 
      collected patients who were transferred by Beijing Emergency Medical Service to the 
      designated hospitals. The information on demographic, epidemiological, clinical, 
      laboratory test for the COVID-19 virus, diagnostic classification, cluster case and 
      outcome were obtained. Furthermore we compared the characteristics between severe 
      and common confirmed cases which including mild cases, no-pneumonia cases and 
      asymptomatic cases, and we also compared the features between COVID-19 and 2003 
      SARS. FINDINGS: By Feb 10, 2020, 262 patients were transferred from the hospitals 
      across Beijing to the designated hospitals for special treatment of the COVID-19 
      infected by Beijing emergency medical service. Among of 262 patients, 46 (17.6%) 
      were severe cases, 216 (82.4%) were common cases, which including 192 (73.3%) mild 
      cases, 11(4.2%) non-pneumonia cases and 13 (5.0%) asymptomatic cases respectively. 
      The median age of patients was 47.5 years old and 48.5% were male. 192 (73.3%) 
      patients were residents of Beijing, 50 (26.0%) of which had been to Wuhan, 116 
      (60.4%) had close contact with confirmed cases, 21 (10.9%) had no contact history. 
      The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever (82.1%), cough (45.8%), 
      fatigue (26.3%), dyspnea (6.9%) and headache (6.5%). The median incubation period 
      was 6.7 days, the interval time from between illness onset and seeing a doctor was 
      4.5 days. As of Feb 10, 17.2% patients have discharged and 81.7% patients remain in 
      hospital in our study, the fatality of COVID-19 infection in Beijing was 0.9%. 
      INTERPRETATION: On the basis of this study, we provided the ratio of the COVID-19 
      infection on the severe cases to the mild, asymptomatic and non-pneumonia cases in 
      Beijing. Population was generally susceptible, and with a relatively low fatality 
      rate. The measures to prevent transmission was very successful at early stage, the 
      next steps on the COVID-19 infection should be focused on early isolation of 
      patients and quarantine for close contacts in families and communities in Beijing.

AB  - The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infected patients by binding human ACE2, 
      leading to severe pneumonia and highly mortality rate in patients. At present, there 
      is no definite and effective treatment for COVID-19. ACE2 plays an important role in 
      the RAS, and the imbalance between ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway and ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas 
      receptor pathway in the RAS system will lead to multi-system inflammation. Increased 
      ACE and Ang II are poor prognostic factors for severe pneumonia. Animal studies have 
      shown that RAS inhibitors could effectively relieve symptoms of acute severe 
      pneumonia and respiratory failure. The binding of COVID-19 and ACE2 resulted in the 
      exhaustion of ACE2, and then ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway was inhibited. The 
      balance of the RAS system was broken, and this would lead to the exacerbation of 
      acute severe pneumonia. Therefore, we speculate that ACEI and AT1R inhibitors could 
      be used in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia under the condition of controlling blood 
      pressure, and might reduce the pulmonary inflammatory response and mortality.

AB  - According to the World Health Organization (WHO), viral diseases continue to emerge 
      and represent a serious issue to public health. In the last twenty years, several 
      viral epidemics such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 
      in 2002 to 2003, and H1N1 influenza in 2009, have been recorded. Most recently, the 
      Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in 
      Saudi Arabia in 2012. In a timeline that reaches the present day, an epidemic of 
      cases with unexplained low respiratory infections detected in Wuhan, the largest 
      metropolitan area in China's Hubei province, was first reported to the WHO Country 
      Office in China, on December 31, 2019. Published literature can trace the beginning 
      of symptomatic individuals back to the beginning of December 2019. As they were 
      unable to identify the causative agent, these first cases were classified as 
      "pneumonia of unknown etiology." The Chinese Center for Disease Control and 
      Prevention (CDC) and local CDCs organized an intensive outbreak investigation 
      program. The etiology of this illness is now attributed to a novel virus belonging 
      to the coronavirus (CoV) family, COVID-19. On February 11, 2020, the WHO 
      Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, announced that the disease caused 
      by this new CoV was a "COVID-19," which is the acronym of "coronavirus disease 
      2019". In the past twenty years, two additional coronavirus epidemics have 
      occurred. SARS-CoV provoked a large-scale epidemic beginning in China and involving 
      two dozen countries with approximately 8000 cases and 800 deaths, and the MERS-CoV 
      that began in Saudi Arabia and has approximately 2,500 cases and 800 deaths and 
      still causes as sporadic cases. This new virus seems to be very contagious and has 
      quickly spread globally. In a meeting on January 30, 2020, per the International 
      Health Regulations (IHR, 2005), the outbreak was declared by the WHO a Public Health 
      Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) as it had spread to 18 countries 
      with four countries reporting human-to-human transmission. An additional landmark 
      occurred on February 26, 2020, as the first case of the disease, not imported from 
      China, was recorded in the United States.  Initially, the new virus was called 
      2019-nCoV. Subsequently, the task of experts of the International Committee on 
      Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) termed it the SARS-CoV-2 virus as it is very similar to 
      the one that caused the SARS outbreak (SARS-CoVs). The CoVs have become the major 
      pathogens of emerging respiratory disease outbreaks. They are a large family of 
      single-stranded RNA viruses (+ssRNA) that can be isolated in different animal 
      species. For reasons yet to be explained, these viruses can cross species barriers 
      and can cause, in humans, illness ranging from the common cold to more severe 
      diseases such as MERS and SARS. Interestingly, these latter viruses have probably 
      originated from bats and then moving into other mammalian hosts — the Himalayan palm 
      civet for SARS-CoV, and the dromedary camel for MERS-CoV — before jumping to humans. 
      The dynamics of SARS-Cov-2 are currently unknown, but there is speculation that it 
      also has an animal origin. The potential for these viruses to grow to become a 
      pandemic worldwide seems to be a serious public health risk. Concerning COVID-19, 
      the WHO raised the threat to the CoV epidemic to the "very high" level, on February 
      28, 2020. Probably, the effects of the epidemic caused by the new CoV has yet to 
      emerge as the situation is quickly evolving. World governments are at work to 
      establish countermeasures to stem possible devastating effects. Health organizations 
      coordinate information flows and issues directives and guidelines to best mitigate 
      the impact of the threat. At the same time, scientists around the world work 
      tirelessly, and information about the transmission mechanisms, the clinical spectrum 
      of disease, new diagnostics, and prevention and therapeutic strategies are rapidly 
      developing. Many uncertainties remain with regard to both the virus-host interaction 
      and the evolution of the epidemic, with specific reference to the times when the 
      epidemic will reach its peak. At the moment, the therapeutic strategies to deal with 
      the infection are only supportive, and prevention aimed at reducing transmission in 
      the community is our best weapon. Aggressive isolation measures in China have led to 
      a progressive reduction of cases in the last few days. In Italy, in geographic 
      regions of the north of the peninsula, political and health authorities are making 
      incredible efforts to contain a shock wave that is severely testing the health 
      system.  In the midst of the crisis, the authors have chosen to use the "Statpearls" 
      platform because, within the PubMed scenario, it represents a unique tool that may 
      allow them to make updates in real-time. The aim, therefore, is to collect 
      information and scientific evidence and to provide an overview of the topic that 
      will be continuously updated.

AB  - An outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19 or 2019-CoV) infection has posed 
      significant threats to international health and the economy. In the absence of 
      treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to find alternative methods to 
      control the spread of disease. Here, we have conducted an online search for all 
      treatment options related to coronavirus infections as well as some RNA-virus 
      infection and we have found that general treatments, coronavirus-specific 
      treatments, and antiviral treatments should be useful in fighting COVID-19. We 
      suggest that the nutritional status of each infected patient should be evaluated 
      before the administration of general treatments and the current children's RNA-virus 
      vaccines including influenza vaccine should be immunized for uninfected people and 
      health care workers. In addition, convalescent plasma should be given to COVID-19 
      patients if it is available. In conclusion, we suggest that all the potential 
      interventions be implemented to control the emerging COVID-19 if the infection is 
      uncontrollable.

TI  - [Potential false-positive rate among the 'asymptomatic infected individuals' in 
      close contacts of COVID-19 patients].
PG  - 485-488
LID - 10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200221-00144 [doi]
AB  - Objective: As the prevention and control of COVID-19continues to advance, the active 
      nucleic acid test screening in the close contacts of the patients has been carrying 
      out in many parts of China. However, the false-positive rate of positive results in 
      the screening has not been reported up to now. 
      But to clearify the false-positive rate during screening is important in COVID-19 control and prevention. 
      Methods: Point values and reasonable ranges of the indicators which impact the 
      false-positive rate of positive results were estimated based on the information 
      available to us at present. The false-positive rate of positive results in the 
      active screening was deduced, and univariate and multivariate-probabilistic 
      sensitivity analyses were performed to understand the robustness of the findings. 
      Results: When the infection rate of the close contacts and the sensitivity and 
      specificity of reported results were taken as the point estimates, the positive 
      predictive value of the active screening was only 19.67%, in contrast, the 
      false-positive rate of positive results was 80.33%. The multivariate-probabilistic 
      sensitivity analysis results supported the base-case findings, with a 75% 
      probability for the false-positive rate of positive results over 47%. Conclusions: 
      In the close contacts of COVID-19 patients, nearly half or even more of the 
      'asymptomatic infected individuals' reported in the active nucleic acid test 
      screening might be false positives.

AB  - The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, which initially began in China, has 
      spread to many countries around the globe, with the number of confirmed cases 
      increasing every day. With a death toll exceeding that of the SARS-CoV outbreak back 
      in 2002 and 2003 in China, 2019-nCoV has led to a public health emergency of 
      international concern, putting all health organizations on high alert. Herein, we 
      present on an overview of the currently available information on the pathogenesis, 
      epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of this virus.

AB  - Since late December 2019, an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) 
      in Wuhan, China has spread quickly nationwide. With the spread of COVID-19, the 
      routine clinical diagnosis and treatment for lung cancer patients has been 
      disturbed. Due to the systemic immunosuppressive of lung cancer patients caused by 
      the malignancy and anticancer treatments, lung cancer patients are more susceptible 
      to infection than healthy individuals. Furthermore, patients with cancer had poorer 
      prognosis from infection. Lung cancer patients should be the priority group for 
      COVID-19 prevention. The protection provisions and control measures aiming to 
      protect lung cancer patients from COVID-19 have been increasingly concerned. During 
      the COVID-19 outbreak period, it should be carefully differentiated for fever and 
      respiratory symptoms for lung cancer patients receiving anti-tumor treatment, in 
      order to evaluate the risk of COVID-19. Moreover, it is necessary to carry out 
      meticulous and individualized clinical management for lung cancer patients to 
      effectively protect the patients from COVID-19.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from Wuhan, China is currently 
      recognized as a public health emergency of global concern. METHODS: We reviewed the 
      currently available literature to provide up-to-date guidance on control measures to 
      be implemented by public health authorities. RESULTS: Some of the epidemiological 
      characteristics of 2019-nCoV have been identified. However, there remain 
      considerable uncertainties, which should be considered when providing guidance to 
      public health authorities on control measures. CONCLUSIONS: Additional studies 
      incorporating more detailed information from confirmed cases would be valuable.

AB  - In late December 2019, a cluster of cases with 2019 Novel Coronavirus pneumonia 
      (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, aroused worldwide concern. Previous studies have 
      reported epidemiological and clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19). The purpose of this brief review is to summarize those published studies 
      as of late February 2020 on the clinical features, symptoms, complications, and 
      treatments of COVID-19 and help provide guidance for frontline medical staff in the 
      clinical management of this outbreak.

TI  - Angiotensin receptor blockers as tentative SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.
LID - 10.1002/ddr.21656 [doi]
AB  - At the time of writing this commentary (February 2020), the coronavirus COVID-19 
      epidemic has already resulted in more fatalities compared with the SARS and MERS 
      coronavirus epidemics combined. Therapeutics that may assist to contain its rapid 
      spread and reduce its high mortality rates are urgently needed. Developing vaccines 
      against the SARS-CoV-2 virus may take many months. Moreover, vaccines based on 
      viral-encoded peptides may not be effective against future coronavirus epidemics, as 
      virus mutations could make them futile. Indeed, new Influenza virus strains emerge 
      every year, requiring new immunizations. A tentative suggestion based on existing 
      therapeutics, which would likely be resistant to new coronavirus mutations, is to 
      use available angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) blockers, such as losartan, as 
      therapeutics for reducing the aggressiveness and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 virus 
      infections. This idea is based on observations that the angiotensin-converting 
      enzyme 2 (ACE2) very likely serves as the binding site for SARS-CoV-2, the strain 
      implicated in the current COVID-19 epidemic, similarly to strain SARS-CoV implicated 
      in the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic. This commentary elaborates on the idea of 
      considering AT1R blockers as tentative treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infections, and 
      proposes a research direction based on datamining of clinical patient records for 
      assessing its feasibility.

AB  - In December 2019, cases of unidentified pneumonia with a history of exposure in the 
      Huanan Seafood Market were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province. A novel coronavirus, 
      SARS-CoV-2, was identified to be accountable for this disease. Human-to-human 
      transmission is confirmed, and this disease (named COVID-19 by World Health 
      Organization (WHO)) spread rapidly around the country and the world. As of 18 
      February 2020, the number of confirmed cases had reached 75,199 with 2009 
      fatalities. The COVID-19 resulted in a much lower case-fatality rate (about 2.67%) 
      among the confirmed cases, compared with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) 
      and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Among the symptom composition of the 45 
      fatality cases collected from the released official reports, the top four are fever, 
      cough, short of breath, and chest tightness/pain. The major comorbidities of the 
      fatality cases include hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, cerebral 
      infarction, and chronic bronchitis. The source of the virus and the pathogenesis of 
      this disease are still unconfirmed. No specific therapeutic drug has been found. The 
      Chinese Government has initiated a level-1 public health response to prevent the 
      spread of the disease. Meanwhile, it is also crucial to speed up the development of 
      vaccines and drugs for treatment, which will enable us to defeat COVID-19 as soon as 
      possible.

AB  - There is a new public health crises threatening the world with the emergence and 
      spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or the severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus originated in bats and was 
      transmitted to humans through yet unknown intermediary animals in Wuhan, Hubei 
      province, China in December 2019. There have been around 96,000 reported cases of 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and 3300 reported deaths to date (05/03/2020). 
      The disease is transmitted by inhalation or contact with infected droplets and the 
      incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 d. The symptoms are usually fever, cough, sore 
      throat, breathlessness, fatigue, malaise among others. The disease is mild in most 
      people; in some (usually the elderly and those with comorbidities), it may progress 
      to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi organ 
      dysfunction. Many people are asymptomatic. The case fatality rate is estimated to 
      range from 2 to 3%. Diagnosis is by demonstration of the virus in respiratory 
      secretions by special molecular tests. Common laboratory findings include normal/ 
      low white cell counts with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). The computerized 
      tomographic chest scan is usually abnormal even in those with no symptoms or mild 
      disease. Treatment is essentially supportive; role of antiviral agents is yet to be 
      established. Prevention entails home isolation of suspected cases and those with 
      mild illnesses and strict infection control measures at hospitals that include 
      contact and droplet precautions. The virus spreads faster than its two ancestors the 
      SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), but has lower 
      fatality. The global impact of this new epidemic is yet uncertain.

AB  - The confirmed and suspected cases of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) 
      have increased not only in Wuhan, Hubei Province but also China and the world. 
      Enormous demand for handling the COVID-19 outbreak challenged both the healthcare 
      personnel and medical supply system. In West China Hospital, Emergency Department 
      (ED) undertook the mission of clinical reception, primary diagnosis, and interim 
      treatment for the suspected cases of COVID-19.

AB  - With a large number of COVID-19 patients discharging from hospital, some had showed 
      re-fever and positive nucleic acid test after discharge from hospital. This might be 
      due to the biological characteristics of 2019-nCoV, and might also be related to the 
      basic disease, clinical status, glucocorticoid using, sample sampling, processing 
      and detecting of patients, and some even related to the re-infection or secondary 
      bacterial virus infection. Therefore, we suggest that in view of this phenomenon, 
      further stratified management of discharge from hospital should be carried out on 
      the basis of guidelines, especially for patients with advanced age, underlying 
      diseases or severe or critical pneumonia. For those patients who can't completely 
      deoxygenate for a long time after hospitalization, individualized treatment methods 
      and different discharge evaluation criteria should be adopted to ensure the complete 
      cure of patients and prevent recurrencing after discharge from hospital.

AB  - At the end of December 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) caused an outbreak in 
      Wuhan, and has quickly spread to all provinces in China and 26 other countries 
      around the world, leading to a serious situation for epidemic prevention. So far, 
      there is still no specific medicine. Previous studies have shown that chloroquine 
      phosphate (chloroquine) had a wide range of antiviral effects, including 
      anti-coronavirus. Here we found that treating the patients diagnosed as novel 
      coronavirus pneumonia with chloroquine might improve the success rate of treatment, 
      shorten hospital stay and improve patient outcome. In order to guide and regulate 
      the use of chloroquine in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia, the multicenter 
      collaboration group of Department of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province 
      and Health Commission of Guangdong Province for chloroquine in the treatment of 
      novel coronavirus pneumonia developed this expert consensus after extensive 
      discussion. It recommended chloroquine phosphate tablet, 500mg twice per day for 10 
      days for patients diagnosed as mild, moderate and severe cases of novel coronavirus 
      pneumonia and without contraindications to chloroquine.

AB  - Objective: To study the effect of COVID-19 on pregnancy outcomes and neonatal 
      prognosis in Hubei Province. Methods: A retrospective comparison of the pregnancy 
      outcomes was done between 16 women with COVID-19 and 45 women without COVID-19. 
      Also, the results of laboratory tests, imaging examinations, and the 2019-nCoV 
      nucleic acid test were performed in 10 cases of neonatal deliverd from women with 
      COVID-19. Results: (1) Of the 16 pregnant women with COVID-19, 15 cases were 
      ordinary type and 1 case was severe type. No one has progressed to critical 
      pneumonia. The delivery method of the two groups was cesarean section, and the 
      gestational age were (38.7±1.4) and (37.9±1.6) weeks, there was no significant 
      difference between the two groups (P> 0.05). Also, there wee no significant 
      differences in the intraoperative blood loss and birth weight of the newborn between 
      the two groups (all P>0.05). (2) Ten cases of neonates delivered from pregnant women 
      with COVID-19 were collected. The 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test were all negative. 
      There were no significant differences in fetal distress, meconium-stained amniotic 
      fluid, preterm birth, and neonatal asphyxia between the two groups (all P>0.05). (3) 
      In the treatment of uterine contraction fatigue, carbetocin or carboprost 
      tromethamine was used more in cesarean section for pregnant women with COVID-19 
      (1.3±0.6), compared with Non-COVID-19 group (0.5±0.7), the difference was 
      statistically significant (P=0.001). Conclusions: If there is an indication for 
      obstetric surgery or critical illness of COVID-19 in pregnant women, timely 
      termination of pregnancy will not increase the risk of premature birth and asphyxia 
      of the newborn, but it is beneficial to the treatment and rehabilitation of maternal 
      pneumonia. Preventive use of long-acting uterotonic agents could reduce the 
      incidence of postpartum hemorrhage during surgery. 2019-nCoV infection has not been 
      found in neonates deliverd from pregnant women with COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan 
      and rapidly spread throughout China. METHODS: Demographic and clinical data of all 
      confirmed cases with COVID-19 on admission at Tongji Hospital from January 10 to 
      February 12, 2020, were collected and analyzed. The data of laboratory examinations, 
      including peripheral lymphocyte subsets, were analyzed and compared between severe 
      and non-severe patients. RESULTS: Of the 452 patients with COVID-19 recruited, 286 
      were diagnosed as severe infection. The median age was 58 years and 235 were male. 
      The most common symptoms were fever, shortness of breath, expectoration, fatigue, 
      dry cough and myalgia. Severe cases tend to have lower lymphocytes counts, higher 
      leukocytes counts and neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio (NLR), as well as lower 
      percentages of monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. Most of severe cases 
      demonstrated elevated levels of infection-related biomarkers and inflammatory 
      cytokines. The number of T cells significantly decreased, and more hampered in 
      severe cases. Both helper T cells and suppressor T cells in patients with COVID-19 
      were below normal levels, and lower level of helper T cells in severe group. The 
      percentage of naïve helper T cells increased and memory helper T cells decreased in 
      severe cases. Patients with COVID-19 also have lower level of regulatory T cells, 
      and more obviously damaged in severe cases. CONCLUSIONS: The novel coronavirus might 
      mainly act on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes. Surveillance of NLR and 
      lymphocyte subsets is helpful in the early screening of critical illness, diagnosis 
      and treatment of COVID-19.

TI  - A systematic review on the efficacy and safety of chloroquine for the treatment of 
      COVID-19.
LID - S0883-9441(20)30390-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jcrc.2020.03.005 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a public health emergency of 
      international concern. As of this time, there is no known effective pharmaceutical 
      treatment, although it is much needed for patient contracting the severe form of the 
      disease. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the evidence regarding 
      chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, and three trial 
      Registries were searched for studies on the use of chloroquine in patients with 
      COVID-19. RESULTS: We included six articles (one narrative letter, one in-vitro 
      study, one editorial, expert consensus paper, two national guideline documents) and 
      23 ongoing clinical trials in China. Chloroquine seems to be effective in limiting 
      the replication of SARS-CoV-2 (virus causing COVID-19) in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: There 
      is rationale, pre-clinical evidence of effectiveness and evidence of safety from 
      long-time clinical use for other indications to justify clinical research on 
      chloroquine in patients with COVID-19. However, clinical use should either adhere to 
      the Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered Interventions (MEURI) framework or be 
      ethically approved as a trial as stated by the World Health Organization. Safety 
      data and data from high-quality clinical trials are urgently needed.

TI  - Relation Between Chest CT Findings and Clinical Conditions of Coronavirus Disease 
      (COVID-19) Pneumonia: A Multicenter Study.
PG  - 1-6
LID - 10.2214/AJR.20.22976 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE. The increasing number of cases of confirmed coronavirus disease 
      (COVID-19) in China is striking. The purpose of this study was to investigate the 
      relation between chest CT findings and the clinical conditions of COVID-19 
      pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Data on 101 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia were 
      retrospectively collected from four institutions in Hunan, China. Basic clinical 
      characteristics and detailed imaging features were evaluated and compared between 
      two groups on the basis of clinical status: nonemergency (mild or common disease) 
      and emergency (severe or fatal disease). RESULTS. Patients 21-50 years old accounted 
      for most (70.2%) of the cohort, and five (5.0%) patients had disease associated with 
      a family outbreak. Most patients (78.2%) had fever as the onset symptom. Most 
      patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had typical imaging features, such as ground-glass 
      opacities (GGO) (87 [86.1%]) or mixed GGO and consolidation (65 [64.4%]), vascular 
      enlargement in the lesion (72 [71.3%]), and traction bronchiectasis (53 [52.5%]). 
      Lesions present on CT images were more likely to have a peripheral distribution (88 
      [87.1%]) and bilateral involvement (83 [82.2%]) and be lower lung predominant (55 
      [54.5%]) and multifocal (55 [54.5%]). Patients in the emergency group were older 
      than those in the non-emergency group. Architectural distortion, traction 
      bronchiectasis, and CT involvement score aided in evaluation of the severity and 
      extent of the disease. CONCLUSION. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia have 
      typical imaging features that can be helpful in early screening of highly suspected 
      cases and in evaluation of the severity and extent of disease. Most patients with 
      COVID-19 pneumonia have GGO or mixed GGO and consolidation and vascular enlargement 
      in the lesion. Lesions are more likely to have peripheral distribution and bilateral 
      involvement and be lower lung predominant and multifocal. CT involvement score can 
      help in evaluation of the severity and extent of the disease.

AB  - An outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that began in Wuhan, China, has spread 
      rapidly, with cases now confirmed in multiple countries. We report the first case of 
      2019-nCoV infection confirmed in the United States and describe the identification, 
      diagnosis, clinical course, and management of the case, including the patient's 
      initial mild symptoms at presentation with progression to pneumonia on day 9 of 
      illness. This case highlights the importance of close coordination between 
      clinicians and public health authorities at the local, state, and federal levels, as 
      well as the need for rapid dissemination of clinical information related to the care 
      of patients with this emerging infection.

TI  - Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China.
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa2002032 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in 
      Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the 
      clinical characteristics of the affected patients. METHODS: We extracted data 
      regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 
      provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in China through January 29, 2020. 
      The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the 
      use of mechanical ventilation, or death. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 
      47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female. The primary composite end point 
      occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% 
      who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died. Only 1.9% of the 
      patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife. Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 
      72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city. 
      The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during 
      hospitalization) and cough (67.8%). Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%). The median 
      incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7). On admission, 
      ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed 
      tomography (CT) (56.4%). No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 
      patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe 
      disease. Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission. 
      CONCLUSIONS: During the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread 
      rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness. Patients often 
      presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings. (Funded 
      by the National Health Commission of China and others.).

AB  - BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has raised world concern since it 
      emerged in Wuhan Hubei China in December, 2019. The infection may result into severe 
      pneumonia with clusters illness onsets. Its impacts on public health make it 
      paramount to clarify the clinical features with other pneumonias. METHODS: Nineteen 
      2019-nCoV pneumonia (NCOVID-19) and fifteen other pneumonia patients (NON-NCOVID-19) 
      in out of Hubei places were involved in this study. Both NCOVID-19 and NON-NCOVID-19 
      patients were confirmed to be infected in throat swabs or/and sputa with or without 
      2019-nCoV by real-time RT-PCR. We analyzed the demographic, epidemiological, 
      clinical, and radiological features from those patients, and compared the difference 
      between NCOVID-19 and NON-NCOVID-19. RESULTS: All patients had a history of exposure 
      to confirmed case of 2019-nCoV or travel to Hubei before illness. The median 
      duration, respectively, was 8 (IQR:6~11) and 5 (IQR:4~11) days from exposure to 
      onset in NCOVID-19 and NON-NCOVID-19. The clinical symptoms were similar between 
      NCOVID-19 and NON-NCOVID-19. The most common symptoms were fever and cough. Fifteen 
      (78.95%) NCOVID-19 but 4 (26.67%) NON-NCOVID-19 patients had bilateral involvement 
      while 17 (89.47%) NCOVID-19 but 1 (6.67%) NON-NCOVID-19 patients had multiple 
      mottling and ground-glass opacity of chest CT images. Compared to NON-NCOVID-19, 
      NCOVID-19 present remarkably more abnormal laboratory tests including AST, ALT, 
      γ-GT, LDH and α-HBDH. CONCLUSION: The 2019-nCoV infection caused similar onsets to 
      other pneumonias. CT scan may be a reliable test for screening NCOVID-19 cases. 
      Liver function damage is more frequent in NCOVID-19 than NON-NCOVID-19 patients. LDH 
      and α-HBDH may be considerable markers for evaluation of NCOVID-19.

TI  - [Management of corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19): the Zhejiang experience].
PG  - 0
AB  - The current epidemic situation of corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19) still remained 
      severe. As the National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, the First 
      Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine is the primary medical 
      care center for COVID-19 inZhejiang Province. Based on the present expert consensus 
      carried out by National Health Commission and National Administration of Traditional 
      Chinese Medicine, our team summarized and established an effective treatment 
      strategy centered on "Four-Anti and Two-Balance" for clinical practice. The 
      "Four-Anti and Two-Balance"strategy included antivirus, anti-shock, anti-hyoxemia, 
      anti-secondary infection, and maintaining of water, electrolyte and acid base 
      balance and microecological balance. Meanwhile, integrated 
      multidisciplinarypersonalized treatment was recommended to improve therapeutic 
      effect. The importance of early viralogical detection, dynamic monitoring of 
      inflammatory indexes and chest radiograph was emphasized in clinical 
      decision-making. Sputum was observed with the highest positive rate of RT-PCR 
      results. Viral nucleic acids could be detected in10% patients'blood samples at acute 
      periodand 50% of patients had positive RT-PCR results in their feces. We also 
      isolated alive viral strains from feces, indicating potential infectiousness of 
      feces.Dynamic cytokine detection was necessary to timely identifyingcytokine storms 
      and application of artificial liver blood purification system. The "Four-Anti and 
      Two-Balance"strategyeffectively increased cure rate and reduced mortality. Early 
      antiviral treatment could alleviate disease severity and prevent illness 
      progression, and we found lopinavir/ritonavir combined with abidol showed 
      antiviraleffects in COVID-19. Shock and hypoxemia were usually caused by cytokine 
      storms. The artificial liver blood purification system could rapidly remove 
      inflammatory mediators and block cytokine storm.Moreover, it also favoredthe balance 
      of fluid, electrolyte and acid-base and thus improved treatment efficacy in critical 
      illness. For cases of severe illness, early and also short periods of moderate 
      glucocorticoid was supported. Patients with oxygenation index below 200 mmHg should 
      be transferred to intensive medical center. Conservative oxygen therapy was 
      preferred and noninvasive ventilation was not recommended. Patients with mechanical 
      ventilation should be strictly supervised with cluster ventilator-associated 
      pneumonia prevention strategies. Antimicrobial prophylaxis should be prescribed 
      rationally and was not recommended except for patients with long course of disease, 
      repeated fever and elevated procalcitonin (PCT), meanwhile secondary fungal 
      infection should be concerned.Some patients with COVID-19 showed intestinal 
      microbialdysbiosis with decreasedprobiotics such as Lactobacillus and 
      Bifidobacterium. Nutritional and gastrointestinal function should be assessed for 
      all patients.Nutritional support and application of prebiotics or probiotics were 
      suggested to regulate the balance of intestinal microbiota and reduce the risk of 
      secondary infection due to bacterial translocation. Anxiety and fear were common in 
      patients with COVID-19. Therefore, we established dynamic assessment and warning for 
      psychological crisis. We also integrated Chinese medicine in treatment to promote 
      disease rehabilitation through classification methods of traditional Chinese 
      medicine. We optimized nursing process for severe patients to promote their 
      rehabilitation. It remained unclear about viral clearance pattern after the 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, two weeks' quarantine for discharged patients was 
      required and a regular following up was also needed.The Zhejiang experience above 
      and suggestions have been implemented in our center and achieved good results. 
      However, since COVID-19 was a newly emerging disease, more work was warranted to 
      improve strategies of prevention, diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19.

TI  - The transmission and diagnosis of 2019 novel coronavirus infection disease 
      (COVID-19): A Chinese perspective.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25749 [doi]
AB  - 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which originated in Wuhan, China, has attracted 
      the world's attention over the last month. The Chinese government has taken 
      emergency measures to control the outbreak and has undertaken initial steps in the 
      diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus infection disease (COVID-19). 
      However, SARS-CoV-2 possesses powerful pathogenicity as well as transmissibility and 
      still holds many mysteries that are yet to be solved, such as whether the virus can 
      be transmitted by asymptomatic patients or by mothers to their infants. Our research 
      presents selected available cases of COVID-19 in China to better understand the 
      transmission and diagnosis regarding this infectious disease.

      (COVID-19)].
PG  - 0
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the dynamic changes of chest CT images of patients with corona 
      virus disease-19 (COVID-19). METHODS: Fifty-two cases of COVID-19 were admitted in 
      the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine. The 
      consecutive chest CT scans were followed up for all patients with an average of 4 
      scans performed per patient during the hospitalization. The shortest interval 
      between each scan was 2 days and the longest was 7 days. The shape, number and 
      distribution of lung shadows, as well as the characteristics of the lesions on the 
      CT images were reviewed. RESULTS: The obvious shadows infiltrating the lungs were 
      shown on CT images in 50 cases, for other 2 cases there was no abnormal changes in 
      the lungs during the first CT examination. Ground-glass opacities (GGO) were found 
      in 48 cases (92.3%), and 19 cases (36.5%) had patchy consolidation and 
      sub-consolidation, which were accompanied with air bronchi sign in 17 cases (32.7%). 
      Forty one cases (78.8%) showed a thickened leaflet interval, 4 cases (7.6%) had a 
      small number of fibrous stripes. During hospitalization, GGO lesions in COVID-19 
      patients gradually became rare, the fibrous strip shadows increased and it became 
      the most common imaging manifestation. The lesions rapidly progressed in 39 cases 
      (75.0%) within 6-9 days after admission. On days 10-14 of admission, the lesions 
      distinctly resolved in 40 cases (76.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The chest CT images of 
      patients with COVID-19 have certain characteristics with dynamic changes, which are 
      of value for monitoring disease progress and clinical treatment.

AB  - As of 22 February 2020, more than 77662 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have been 
      documented globally with over 2360 deaths. Common presentations of confirmed cases 
      include fever, fatigue, dry cough, upper airway congestion, sputum production, 
      shortness of breath, myalgia/arthralgia with lymphopenia, prolonged prothrombin 
      time, elevated C-reactive protein, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. The reported 
      severe/critical case ratio is approximately 7-10% and median time to intensive care 
      admission is 9.5-10.5 days with mortality of around 1-2% varied geographically. 
      Similar to outbreaks of other newly identified virus, there is no proven regimen 
      from conventional medicine and most reports managed the patients with 
      lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, beta-interferon, glucocorticoid and supportive 
      treatment with remdesivir undergoing clinical trial. In China, Chinese medicine is 
      proposed as a treatment option by national and provincial guidelines with 
      substantial utilization. We reviewed the latest national and provincial clinical 
      guidelines, retrospective cohort studies, and case series regarding the treatment of 
      COVID-19 by add-on Chinese medicine. We have also reviewed the clinical evidence 
      generated from SARS and H1N1 management with hypothesized mechanisms and latest in 
      silico findings to identify candidate Chinese medicines for the consideration of 
      possible trials and management. Given the paucity of strongly evidence-based 
      regimens, the available data suggest that Chinese medicine could be considered as an 
      adjunctive therapeutic option in the management of COVID-19.

      by the 2019 novel coronavirus.
LID - 10.1007/s12519-020-00345-5 [doi]
AB  - Since December 2019, an epidemic caused by novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection 
      has occurred unexpectedly in China. As of 8 pm, 31 January 2020, more than 20 
      pediatric cases have been reported in China. Of these cases, ten patients were 
      identified in Zhejiang Province, with an age of onset ranging from 112 days to 
      17 years. Following the latest National recommendations for diagnosis and treatment 
      of pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV (the 4th edition) and current status of clinical 
      practice in Zhejiang Province, recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of 
      respiratory infection caused by 2019-nCoV for children were drafted by the National 
      Clinical Research Center for Child Health, the National Children's Regional Medical 
      Center, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine to further 
      standardize the protocol for diagnosis and treatment of respiratory infection in 
      children caused by 2019-nCoV.

AB  - As of January 22, 2020, a total of 571 cases of the 2019-new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) 
      have been reported in 25 provinces (districts and cities) in China. At present, 
      there is no vaccine or antiviral treatment for human and animal coronavirus, so that 
      identifying the drug treatment options as soon as possible is critical for the 
      response to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Three general methods, which include existing 
      broad-spectrum antiviral drugs using standard assays, screening of a chemical 
      library containing many existing compounds or databases, and the redevelopment of 
      new specific drugs based on the genome and biophysical understanding of individual 
      coronaviruses, are used to discover the potential antiviral treatment of human 
      pathogen coronavirus. Lopinavir /Ritonavir, Nucleoside analogues, Neuraminidase 
      inhibitors, Remdesivir, peptide (EK1), abidol, RNA synthesis inhibitors (such as 
      TDF, 3TC), anti-inflammatory drugs (such as hormones and other molecules), Chinese 
      traditional medicine, such ShuFengJieDu Capsules and Lianhuaqingwen Capsule, could 
      be the drug treatment options for 2019-nCoV. However, the efficacy and safety of 
      these drugs for 2019- nCoV still need to be further confirmed by clinical 
      experiments.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 has become an important public health issue in the world. More than 
      118 000 cases were confirmed around the world. The main clinical manifestations were 
      respiratory symptoms and occasional gastrointestinal symptoms. However, there is no 
      unified standard for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. In the retrospective 
      analysis, we report nine cases of COVID-19, describe the history of contact, 
      clinical manifestations, the course of diagnosis and clinical treatment before, 
      during and after treatment.

TI  - Novel coronavirus COVID-19: an overview for emergency clinicians.
PG  - 1-21
AB  - Prior to the global outbreak of SARS-CoV in 2003, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 were the 
      only coronaviruses known to infect humans. Following the SARS outbreak, 5 additional 
      coronaviruses have been discovered in humans, most recently the novel coronavirus 
      COVID-19, believed to have originated in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. SARS-CoV and 
      MERSCoV are particularly pathogenic in humans and are associated with high 
      mortality. In this review, the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management of the 
      recently discovered COVID-19 are reviewed, with a focus on best practices and the 
      public health implications.

TI  - Can Chinese Medicine Be Used for Prevention of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)? 
      A Review of Historical Classics, Research Evidence and Current Prevention Programs.
LID - 10.1007/s11655-020-3192-6 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Since December 2019, an outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
      occurred in Wuhan, and rapidly spread to almost all parts of China. This was 
      followed by prevention programs recommending Chinese medicine (CM) for the 
      prevention. In order to provide evidence for CM recommendations, we reviewed ancient 
      classics and human studies. METHODS: Historical records on prevention and treatment 
      of infections in CM classics, clinical evidence of CM on the prevention of severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 influenza, and CM prevention programs 
      issued by health authorities in China since the COVID-19 outbreak were retrieved 
      from different databases and websites till 12 February, 2020. Research evidence 
      included data from clinical trials, cohort or other population studies using CM for 
      preventing contagious respiratory virus diseases. RESULTS: The use of CM to prevent 
      epidemics of infectious diseases was traced back to ancient Chinese practice cited 
      in Huangdi's Internal Classic (Huang Di Nei Jing) where preventive effects were 
      recorded. There were 3 studies using CM for prevention of SARS and 4 studies for 
      H1N1 influenza. None of the participants who took CM contracted SARS in the 3 
      studies. The infection rate of H1N1 influenza in the CM group was significantly 
      lower than the non-CM group (relative risk 0.36, 95% confidence interval 0.24-0.52; 
      n=4). For prevention of COVID-19, 23 provinces in China issued CM programs. The main 
      principles of CM use were to tonify qi to protect from external pathogens, disperse 
      wind and discharge heat, and resolve dampness. The most frequently used herbs 
      included Radix astragali (Huangqi), Radix glycyrrhizae (Gancao), Radix 
      saposhnikoviae (Fangfeng), Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae (Baizhu), Lonicerae 
      Japonicae Flos (Jinyinhua), and Fructus forsythia (Lianqiao). CONCLUSIONS: Based on 
      historical records and human evidence of SARS and H1N1 influenza prevention, Chinese 
      herbal formula could be an alternative approach for prevention of COVID-19 in 
      high-risk population. Prospective, rigorous population studies are warranted to 
      confirm the potential preventive effect of CM.

AB  - From December 2019, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia (formerly known as 
      the 2019 novel Coronavirus [2019-nCoV]) broke out in Wuhan, China. In this study, we 
      present serial CT findings in a 40-year-old female patient with COVID-19 pneumonia 
      who presented with the symptoms of fever, chest tightness, and fatigue. She was 
      diagnosed with COVID-19 infection confirmed by real-time 
      reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. CT showed rapidly progressing 
      peripheral consolidations and ground-glass opacities in both lungs. After treatment, 
      the lesions were shown to be almost absorbed leaving the fibrous lesions.

TI  - Transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak and effectiveness of government 
      interventions: A data-driven analysis.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25750 [doi]
AB  - Using the parameterized susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model, we simulated 
      the spread dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak and impact of 
      different control measures, conducted the sensitivity analysis to identify the key 
      factor, plotted the trend curve of effective reproductive number (R), and performed 
      data fitting after the simulation. By simulation and data fitting, the model showed 
      the peak existing confirmed cases of 59 769 arriving on 15 February 2020, with the 
      coefficient of determination close to 1 and the fitting bias 3.02%, suggesting high 
      precision of the data-fitting results. More rigorous government control policies 
      were associated with a slower increase in the infected population. Isolation and 
      protective procedures would be less effective as more cases accrue, so the 
      optimization of the treatment plan and the development of specific drugs would be of 
      more importance. There was an upward trend of R in the beginning, followed by a 
      downward trend, a temporary rebound, and another continuous decline. The feature of 
      high infectiousness for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) 
      led to an upward trend, and government measures contributed to the temporary rebound 
      and declines. The declines of R could be exploited as strong evidence for the 
      effectiveness of the interventions. Evidence from the four-phase stringent measures 
      showed that it was significant to ensure early detection, early isolation, early 
      treatment, adequate medical supplies, patients' being admitted to designated 
      hospitals, and comprehensive therapeutic strategy. Collaborative efforts are 
      required to combat the novel coronavirus, focusing on both persistent strict 
      domestic interventions and vigilance against exogenous imported cases.

LID - 10.1007/s00247-020-04656-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infection with COVID-19 is currently rare in children. OBJECTIVE: To 
      describe chest CT findings in children with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We 
      studied children at a large tertiary-care hospital in China, during the period from 
      28 January 2019 to 8 February 2020, who had positive reverse transcriptase 
      polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19. We recorded findings at any chest 
      CT performed in the included children, along with core clinical observations. 
      RESULTS: We included five children from 10 months to 6 years of age (mean 
      3.4 years). All had had at least one CT scan after admission. Three of these five 
      had CT abnormality on the first CT scan (at 2 days, 4 days and 9 days, respectively, 
      after onset of symptoms) in the form of patchy ground-glass opacities; all 
      normalised during treatment. CONCLUSION: Compared to reports in adults, we found 
      similar but more modest lung abnormalities at CT in our small paediatric cohort.

      Proven Protease Inhibitor.
LID - S0092-8674(20)30229-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052 [doi]
AB  - The recent emergence of the novel, pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 
      China and its rapid national and international spread pose a global health 
      emergency. Cell entry of coronaviruses depends on binding of the viral spike (S) 
      proteins to cellular receptors and on S protein priming by host cell proteases. 
      Unravelling which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide 
      insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets. Here, we 
      demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the serine 
      protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical 
      use blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option. Finally, we show that the 
      sera from convalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized SARS-2-S-driven entry. Our 
      results reveal important commonalities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection and 
      identify a potential target for antiviral intervention.

AB  - The recent outbreak of respiratory illness in Wuhan, China is caused by a novel 
      coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV, which is genetically close to a bat-derived 
      coronavirus. 2019-nCoV is categorized as beta genus coronavirus, same as the two 
      other strains - severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle 
      East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Antiviral drugs commonly used in 
      clinical practice, including neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, paramivir, 
      zanamivir, etc.), ganciclovir, acyclovir and ribavirin, are invalid for 2019-nCoV 
      and not recommended. Drugs are possibly effective for 2019-nCoV include: remdesivir, 
      lopinavir / ritonavir, lopinavir / ritonavir combined with interferon-β, 
      convalescent plasma, and monoclonal antibodies. But the efficacy and safety of these 
      drugs for 2019-nCoV pneumonia patients need to be assessed by further clinical 
      trials.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore the epidemiological information, clinical characteristics, 
      therapeutic outcomes and temporal progression of laboratory findings in 
      2019-coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients exposed to lopinavir. METHODS: We 
      collected data from ten COVID-19 patients admitted between January 22, 2020 and 
      February 11, 2020 at Xixi hospital in Hangzhou, China. RESULTS: Of ten patients, 
      secondary, tertiary and quartus patients emerged, the incubation period was 3-7 
      days. Mainly initial symptoms were cough and low fever (37.3-38.0 ℃). An 
      asymptomatic case presented normal radiography, the others existed ground glass 
      opacities. All cases (three transferred, seven discharged) exposed to lopinavir on 
      initial hospitalization. Three patients stopped lopinavir using because of adverse 
      effect, two of them deteriorated, one hospitalized longer than others who with 
      sustained lopinavir using. Levels of potassium, albumin, lymphocyte were low, but 
      increased persistently after treatment. Eosinophil values were low on initial 
      hospitalization, then all returned to normal before discharge. Viral load of 
      SARS-CoV-2, radiography and eosinophil improved continuously in 3-14, 6-8 and 7-9 
      days, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing eosinophils may be an indicator of 
      COVID-19 improvement. The COVID-19 patients may benefit from sustained lopinavir 
      using. More researches on a larger scale are needed to verify these points.

LID - E538 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm9020538 [doi]
AB  - The geographic spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections from the 
      epicenter of Wuhan, China, has provided an opportunity to study the natural history 
      of the recently emerged virus. Using publicly available event-date data from the 
      ongoing epidemic, the present study investigated the incubation period and other 
      time intervals that govern the epidemiological dynamics of COVID-19 infections. Our 
      results show that the incubation period falls within the range of 2-14 days with 95% 
      confidence and has a mean of around 5 days when approximated using the best-fit 
      lognormal distribution. The mean time from illness onset to hospital admission (for 
      treatment and/or isolation) was estimated at 3-4 days without truncation and at 5-9 
      days when right truncated. Based on the 95th percentile estimate of the incubation 
      period, we recommend that the length of quarantine should be at least 14 days. The 
      median time delay of 13 days from illness onset to death (17 days with right 
      truncation) should be considered when estimating the COVID-19 case fatality risk.

TI  - Risk Factors Associated With Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and Death in 
      Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pneumonia in Wuhan, China.
LID - 10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.0994 [doi]
LID - e200994
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease 
      that was first reported in Wuhan, China, and has subsequently spread worldwide. Risk 
      factors for the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 pneumonia have not yet been well 
      delineated. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes in 
      patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome 
      (ARDS) or died. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study of 201 
      patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital in 
      China between December 25, 2019, and January 26, 2020. The final date of follow-up 
      was February 13, 2020. EXPOSURES: Confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: The development of ARDS and death. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, 
      laboratory, management, treatment, and outcome data were also collected and 
      analyzed. RESULTS: Of 201 patients, the median age was 51 years (interquartile 
      range, 43-60 years), and 128 (63.7%) patients were men. Eighty-four patients (41.8%) 
      developed ARDS, and of those 84 patients, 44 (52.4%) died. In those who developed 
      ARDS, compared with those who did not, more patients presented with dyspnea (50 of 
      84 [59.5%] patients and 30 of 117 [25.6%] patients, respectively [difference, 33.9%; 
      95% CI, 19.7%-48.1%]) and had comorbidities such as hypertension (23 of 84 [27.4%] 
      patients and 16 of 117 [13.7%] patients, respectively [difference, 13.7%; 95% CI, 
      1.3%-26.1%]) and diabetes (16 of 84 [19.0%] patients and 6 of 117 [5.1%] patients, 
      respectively [difference, 13.9%; 95% CI, 3.6%-24.2%]). In bivariate Cox regression 
      analysis, risk factors associated with the development of ARDS and progression from 
      ARDS to death included older age (hazard ratio [HR], 3.26; 95% CI 2.08-5.11; and HR, 
      6.17; 95% CI, 3.26-11.67, respectively), neutrophilia (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.09-1.19; 
      and HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.17, respectively), and organ and coagulation 
      dysfunction (eg, higher lactate dehydrogenase [HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.44-1.79; and HR, 
      1.30; 95% CI, 1.11-1.52, respectively] and D-dimer [HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04; and 
      HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04, respectively]). High fever (≥39 °C) was associated with 
      higher likelihood of ARDS development (HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.11-2.84) and lower 
      likelihood of death (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.21-0.82). Among patients with ARDS, 
      treatment with methylprednisolone decreased the risk of death (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 
      0.20-0.72). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Older age was associated with greater risk of 
      development of ARDS and death likely owing to less rigorous immune response. 
      Although high fever was associated with the development of ARDS, it was also 
      associated with better outcomes among patients with ARDS. Moreover, treatment with 
      methylprednisolone may be beneficial for patients who develop ARDS.

AB  - In December 2019, a new type viral pneumonia cases occurred in Wuhan, Hubei 
      Province; and then named "2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)" by the World Health 
      Organization (WHO) on 12 January 2020. For it is a never been experienced 
      respiratory disease before and with infection ability widely and quickly, it 
      attracted the world's attention but without treatment and control manual. For the 
      request from frontline clinicians and public health professionals of 2019-nCoV 
      infected pneumonia management, an evidence-based guideline urgently needs to be 
      developed. Therefore, we drafted this guideline according to the rapid advice 
      guidelines methodology and general rules of WHO guideline development; we also added 
      the first-hand management data of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. This 
      guideline includes the guideline methodology, epidemiological characteristics, 
      disease screening and population prevention, diagnosis, treatment and control 
      (including traditional Chinese Medicine), nosocomial infection prevention and 
      control, and disease nursing of the 2019-nCoV. Moreover, we also provide a whole 
      process of a successful treatment case of the severe 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia 
      and experience and lessons of hospital rescue for 2019-nCoV infections. This rapid 
      advice guideline is suitable for the first frontline doctors and nurses, managers of 
      hospitals and healthcare sections, community residents, public health persons, 
      relevant researchers, and all person who are interested in the 2019-nCoV.

TI  - Perspectives on monoclonal antibody therapy as potential therapeutic intervention 
      for Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19).
LID - 10.12932/AP-200220-0773 [doi]
AB  - Last decade witnessed the outbreak of many life-threatening human pathogens 
      including Nipah, Ebola, Chikungunya, Zika, Middle East respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Severe Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and 
      more recently novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2). The disease condition 
      associated with novel coronavirus, referred to as Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). 
      The emergence of novel coronavirus in 2019 in Wuhan, China marked the third highly 
      pathogenic coronavirus infecting humans in the 21st century. The continuing 
      emergence of coronaviruses at regular intervals poses a significant threat to human 
      health and economy. Ironically, even after a decade of research on coronavirus, 
      still there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutic agents to treat coronavirus 
      infection which highlights an urgent need to develop effective vaccines or 
      post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent future epidemics. Several clinical, genetic and 
      epidemiological features of COVID-19 resemble SARS-CoV infection. Hence, the 
      research advancements on SARS-CoV treatment might help scientific community in quick 
      understanding of this virus pathogenesis and develop effective 
      therapeutic/prophylactic agents to treat and prevent this infection. Monoclonal 
      antibodies represent the major class of biotherapeutics for passive immunotherapy to 
      fight against viral infection. The therapeutic potential of monoclonal antibodies 
      has been well recognized in the treatment of many diseases. Here, we summarize the 
      potential monoclonal antibody based therapeutic intervention for COVID-19 by 
      considering the existing knowledge on the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against 
      similar coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Further research on COVID-19 
      pathogenesis could identify appropriate therapeutic targets to develop specific 
      anti-virals against this newly emerging pathogen.

AB  - A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) causing severe acute respiratory disease emerged 
      recently in Wuhan, China. Information on reported cases strongly indicates 
      human-to-human spread, and the most recent information is increasingly indicative of 
      sustained human-to-human transmission. While the overall severity profile among 
      cases may change as more mild cases are identified, we estimate a risk of fatality 
      among hospitalised cases at 14% (95% confidence interval: 3.9-32%).

TI  - Compounds with therapeutic potential against novel respiratory 2019 coronavirus.
LID - AAC.00399-20 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/AAC.00399-20 [doi]
AB  - Currently, the expansion of the novel human respiratory coronavirus (known as: 
      SARS-CoV-2, COVID-2019, or 2019-nCoV) has stressed the need for therapeutic 
      alternatives to alleviate and stop this new epidemic. The previous epidemics of 
      high-morbidity human coronaviruses, such as the acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome corona 
      virus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, prompted the characterization of compounds that could be 
      potentially active against the currently emerging novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The 
      most promising compound is remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleotide analog prodrug 
      currently in clinical trials for treating Ebola virus infections. Remdesivir 
      inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in tissue cultures, and it 
      displayed efficacy in non-human animal models. In addition, a combination of the 
      human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitors, 
      lopinavir/ritonavir, and interferon beta (LPV/RTV-INFb) were shown to be effective 
      in patients infected with SARS-CoV. LPV/RTV-INFb also improved clinical parameters 
      in marmosets and mice infected with MERS-CoV. Remarkably, the therapeutic efficacy 
      of remdesivir appeared to be superior to that of LPV/RTV-INFb against MERS-CoV in a 
      transgenic humanized mice model. The relatively high mortality rates associated with 
      these three novel human coronavirus infections, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, 
      has suggested that pro-inflammatory responses might play a role in the pathogenesis. 
      It remains unknown whether the generated inflammatory state should be targeted. 
      Therapeutics that target the coronavirus alone might not be able to reverse highly 
      pathogenic infections. This minireview aimed to provide a summary of therapeutic 
      compounds that showed potential in fighting SARS-CoV-2 infections.

TI  - Development and Clinical Application of A Rapid IgM-IgG Combined Antibody Test for 
      SARS-CoV-2 Infection Diagnosis.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25727 [doi]
AB  - The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) quickly spread all over 
      China and to more than 20 other countries. Although the virus (SARS-Cov-2) nucleic 
      acid RT-PCR test has become the standard method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 
      infection, these real-time PCR test kits have many limitations. In addition, high 
      false negative rates were reported. There is an urgent need for an accurate and 
      rapid test method to quickly identify large number of infected patients and 
      asymptomatic carriers to prevent virus transmission and assure timely treatment of 
      patients. We have developed a rapid and simple point-of-care lateral flow 
      immunoassay which can detect IgM and IgG antibodies simultaneously against 
      SARS-CoV-2 virus in human blood within 15 minutes which can detect patients at 
      different infection stages. With this test kit, we carried out clinical studies to 
      validate its clinical efficacy uses. The clinical detection sensitivity and 
      specificity of this test were measured using blood samples collected from 397 PCR 
      confirmed COVID-19 patients and 128 negative patients at 8 different clinical sites. 
      The overall testing sensitivity was 88.66% and specificity was 90.63%. In addition, 
      we evaluated clinical diagnosis results obtained from different types of venous and 
      fingerstick blood samples. The results indicated great detection consistency among 
      samples from fingerstick blood, serum and plasma of venous blood. The IgM-IgG 
      combined assay has better utility and sensitivity compared with a single IgM or IgG 
      test. It can be used for the rapid screening of SARS-CoV-2 carriers, symptomatic or 
      asymptomatic, in hospitals, clinics, and test laboratories. This article is

TI  - Clinical and High-Resolution CT Features of the COVID-19 Infection: Comparison of 
      the Initial and Follow-up Changes.
LID - 10.1097/RLI.0000000000000674 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In late December, 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in 
      Wuhan, China was caused by a novel coronavirus, newly named severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We aimed to quantify severity of COVID-19 
      infection on High-Resolution CT and to determine its relationship with clinical 
      parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From Jan 11, 2020, to Feb 5, 2020, the clinical, 
      laboratory and HRCT features of 42 patients (26-75 years, 25 males) with COVID-19 
      were analyzed. The initial and follow-up CT obtained a mean of 4.5 days and 11.6 
      days from the illness onset were retrospectively assessed for the severity and 
      progression of pneumonia. Correlations among clinical parameters, initial CT 
      features and progression of opacifications were evaluated with Spearman correlation 
      and linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-five (83%) patients exhibited a 
      progressive process according to CT features during the early stage from onset. 
      Follow-up CT findings showed progressive opacifications, consolidation, interstitial 
      thickening, fibrous strips and air bronchograms, compared to initial CT (all 
      p<0.05). Before regular treatments, there was a moderate correlation between the 
      days from onset and sum score of opacifications (R=0.68, p<0.01). The C-reactive 
      protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and lactate dehydrogenase showed 
      significantly positive correlation with the severity of pneumonia assessed on 
      initial CT (R range 0.36-0.75, p<0.05). The highest temperature and the severity of 
      opacifications assessed on initial CT were significantly related to the progression 
      of opacifications on follow-up CT (p=0.001-0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with the 
      COVID-19 infection usually presented with typical ground-grass opacities and other 
      CT features, which showed significant correlations with some clinical and laboratory 
      measurements. Follow-up CT images often demonstrated progressions during the early 
      stage from illness onset.

TI  - Analysis of factors associated with disease outcomes in hospitalized patients with 
      2019 novel coronavirus disease.
LID - 10.1097/CM9.0000000000000775 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since early December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) 
      has caused pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan, Hubei province of China. This study aims to 
      investigate the factors affecting the progression of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. 
      Associated results will be used to evaluate the prognosis and to find the optimal 
      treatment regimens for COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Patients tested positive for the 
      COVID-19 based on nucleic acid detection were included in this study. Patients were 
      admitted to 3 tertiary hospitals in Wuhan between December 30, 2019, and January 15, 
      2020. Individual data, laboratory indices, imaging characteristics, and clinical 
      data were collected, and statistical analysis was performed. Based on clinical 
      typing results, the patients were divided into a progression group or an 
      improvement/stabilization group. Continuous variables were analyzed using 
      independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were 
      analyzed using Chi-squared test or Fisher exact test. Logistic regression analysis 
      was performed to explore the risk factors for disease progression. RESULTS: 
      Seventy-eight patients with COVID-19-induced pneumonia met the inclusion criteria 
      and were included in this study. Efficacy evaluation at 2 weeks after 
      hospitalization indicated that 11 patients (14.1%) had deteriorated, and 67 patients 
      (85.9%) had improved/stabilized. The patients in the progression group were 
      significantly older than those in the disease improvement/stabilization group (66 
      [51, 70] vs. 37 [32, 41] years, U = 4.932, P = 0.001). The progression group had a 
      significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking than the 
      improvement/stabilization group (27.3% vs. 3.0%, χ = 9.291, P = 0.018). For all the 
      78 patients, fever was the most common initial symptom, and the maximum body 
      temperature at admission was significantly higher in the progression group than in 
      the improvement/stabilization group (38.2 [37.8, 38.6] vs. 37.5 [37.0, 38.4]°C, 
      U = 2.057, P = 0.027). Moreover, the proportion of patients with respiratory failure 
      (54.5% vs. 20.9%, χ = 5.611, P = 0.028) and respiratory rate (34 [18, 48] vs. 24 
      [16, 60] breaths/min, U = 4.030, P = 0.004) were significantly higher in the 
      progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group. C-reactive protein 
      was significantly elevated in the progression group compared to the 
      improvement/stabilization group (38.9 [14.3, 64.8] vs. 10.6 [1.9, 33.1] mg/L, 
      U = 1.315, P = 0.024). Albumin was significantly lower in the progression group than 
      in the improvement/stabilization group (36.62 ± 6.60 vs. 41.27 ± 4.55 g/L, 
      U = 2.843, P = 0.006). Patients in the progression group were more likely to receive 
      high-level respiratory support than in the improvement/stabilization group 
      (χ = 16.01, P = 0.001). Multivariate logistic analysis indicated that age (odds 
      ratio [OR], 8.546; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.628-44.864; P = 0.011), history 
      of smoking (OR, 14.285; 95% CI: 1.577-25.000; P = 0.018), maximum body temperature 
      at admission (OR, 8.999; 95% CI: 1.036-78.147, P = 0.046), respiratory failure (OR, 
      8.772, 95% CI: 1.942-40.000; P = 0.016), albumin (OR, 7.353, 95% CI: 1.098-50.000; 
      P = 0.003), and C-reactive protein (OR, 10.530; 95% CI: 1.224-34.701, P = 0.028) 
      were risk factors for disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: Several factors that led to 
      the progression of COVID-19 pneumonia were identified, including age, history of 
      smoking, maximum body temperature on admission, respiratory failure, albumin, 
      C-reactive protein. These results can be used to further enhance the ability of 
      management of COVID-19 pneumonia.

      novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) patients.

AB  - A global health emergency has been declared by the World Health Organization as the 
      2019-nCoV outbreak spreads across the world, with confirmed patients in Canada. 
      Patients infected with 2019-nCoV are at risk for developing respiratory failure and 
      requiring admission to critical care units. While providing optimal treatment for 
      these patients, careful execution of infection control measures is necessary to 
      prevent nosocomial transmission to other patients and to healthcare workers 
      providing care. Although the exact mechanisms of transmission are currently unclear, 
      human-to-human transmission can occur, and the risk of airborne spread during 
      aerosol-generating medical procedures remains a concern in specific circumstances. 
      This paper summarizes important considerations regarding patient screening, 
      environmental controls, personal protective equipment, resuscitation measures 
      (including intubation), and critical care unit operations planning as we prepare for 
      the possibility of new imported cases or local outbreaks of 2019-nCoV. Although 
      understanding of the 2019-nCoV virus is evolving, lessons learned from prior 
      infectious disease challenges such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome will 
      hopefully improve our state of readiness regardless of the number of cases we 
      eventually manage in Canada.

AB  - Coronaviruses (CoVs) are RNA viruses that have become a major public health concern 
      since the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV) outbreak in 2002. The 
      continuous evolution of coronaviruses was further highlighted with the emergence of 
      the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) outbreak in 2012. Currently, the 
      world is concerned about the 2019 novel CoV (SARS-CoV-2) that was initially 
      identified in the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019. Patients presented with 
      severe viral pneumonia and respiratory illness. The number of cases has been 
      mounting since then. As of late February 2020, tens of thousands of cases and 
      several thousand deaths have been reported in China alone, in addition to thousands 
      of cases in other countries. Although the fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 is currently 
      lower than SARS-CoV, the virus seems to be highly contagious based on the number of 
      infected cases to date. In this review, we discuss structure, genome organization, 
      entry of CoVs into target cells, and provide insights into past and present 
      outbreaks. The future of human CoV outbreaks will not only depend on how the viruses 
      will evolve, but will also depend on how we develop efficient prevention and 
      treatment strategies to deal with this continuous threat.

      caused by malignancy and anticancer treatments, patients with advanced lung cancer 
      may be at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection. During epidemic of COVID-19, a 
      guideline for the optimal management of patients with advanced lung cancer urgently 
      needs to be proposed to distinguish the symptoms of COVID-19 and the side effects of 
      antitumor drugs. This network questionnaire survey was conducted on the lung cancer 
      group of the Chinese Thoracic Society, Chinese Medical Association; the lung cancer 
      group of the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology Youth Committee; and the Chinese 
      Respiratory Oncology Collaboration. 321 valid questionnaires were received. Based on 
      the guidelines on lung cancer and the results of the questionnaires, a consensus was 
      reached. During the epidemic of COVID-19, We recommended that patients with advanced 
      NSCLC should be treated as outpatients as possible at the nearest medical center; 
      Patients who need to be hospitalized for antitumor treatment should be excluded from 
      COVID-19 infection; More intensive attention should be paid to identification of 
      COVID-19-related symptoms and adverse reactions caused by the malignancy or 
      antitumor treatments. Stronger personal protection should be made for advanced NSCLC 
      patients; An intentional postponing of antitumor treatment should be considered 
      according to patient performance status. Treatment strategies should be made 
      according to different types of advanced NSCLC patients and efficacy and toxicity of 
      drugs.

AB  - An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the 2019 novel 
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019, and 
      has spread throughout China and to 31 other countries and territories, including the 
      United States (1). As of February 23, 2020, there were 76,936 reported cases in 
      mainland China and 1,875 cases in locations outside mainland China (1). There have 
      been 2,462 associated deaths worldwide; no deaths have been reported in the United 
      States. Fourteen cases have been diagnosed in the United States, and an additional 
      39 cases have occurred among repatriated persons from high-risk settings, for a 
      current total of 53 cases within the United States. This report summarizes the 
      aggressive measures (2,3) that CDC, state and local health departments, multiple 
      other federal agencies, and other partners are implementing to slow and try to 
      contain transmission of COVID-19 in the United States. These measures require the 
      identification of cases and contacts of persons with COVID-19 in the United States 
      and the recommended assessment, monitoring, and care of travelers arriving from 
      areas with substantial COVID-19 transmission. Although these measures might not 
      prevent widespread transmission of the virus in the United States, they are being 
      implemented to 1) slow the spread of illness; 2) provide time to better prepare 
      state and local health departments, health care systems, businesses, educational 
      organizations, and the general public in the event that widespread transmission 
      occurs; and 3) better characterize COVID-19 to guide public health recommendations 
      and the development and deployment of medical countermeasures, including 
      diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. U.S. public health authorities are 
      monitoring the situation closely, and CDC is coordinating efforts with the World 
      Health Organization (WHO) and other global partners. Interim guidance is available 
      at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/index.html. As more is learned about this novel 
      virus and this outbreak, CDC will rapidly incorporate new knowledge into guidance 
      for action by CDC, state and local health departments, health care providers, and 
      communities.

AB  - A novel coronavirus, designated as 2019-nCoV, hit the central Chinese city of Wuhan 
      in late December 2019, and subsequently spread rapidly to all provinces of China and 
      multiple countries. As of 0:00 am February 9, 2020, a total of 37,287 cases have 
      been confirmed infection of 2019-nCoV in China mainland, and 302 cases have also 
      been cumulatively reported from 24 countries. According to the latest data, a total 
      of 813 deaths occurred in China mainland, with the mortality reaching approximately 
      2.2%. At present, there is no vaccine or specific drugs for the human coronavirus. 
      Therefore, it is critical to understand the nature of the virus and its clinical 
      characteristics, in order to respond to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Thus, the present 
      study briefly but comprehensively summarizes the not much but timely reports on the 
      2019-nCoV.

TI  - Clinical Characteristics of Imported Cases of COVID-19 in Jiangsu Province: A 
      Multicenter Descriptive Study.
LID - ciaa199 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciaa199 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to report the clinical characteristics of imported coronavirus 
      disease-19 (COVID-19) in Jiangsu Province. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated 
      the clinical, imaging, and laboratory characteristics of confirmed cases of COVID-19 
      with WHO interim guidance in three Grade ⅢA hospitals of Jiangsu from Jan 22 to Feb 
      14, 2020. Real time RT-PCR was used to detect the new coronavirus in respiratory 
      samples. RESULTS: Of the 80 patients infected with COVID-19, 41 patients were 
      female, with a median age of 46.1 years. Except for 3 severe patients, the rest of 
      the 77 patients exhibited mild or moderate symptoms. 9 patients were unconfirmed 
      until a third-time nucleic acid test. 38 cases had a history of chronic diseases. 
      The main clinical manifestations of the patients were fever and cough, which 
      accounted for 63 cases (78.75%) and 51 cases (-63.75%) respectively. Only 3 patients 
      (3.75%) showed liver dysfunction. Imaging examination showed that 55 patients 
      (-68.75%) showed abnormal, 25 cases (31.25%) had no abnormal density shadow in the 
      parenchyma of both lungs. Up to now, 21 cases were discharged from the hospital, and 
      no patient died. The average length of stay for discharged patients was 8 days. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the cases in Wuhan, the cases in Jiangsu exhibited mild 
      or moderate symptoms and no obvious gender susceptivity. The proportion of patients 
      having liver dysfunction and abnormal CT imaging was relatively lower than that of 
      Wuhan. Notably, infected patients may be falsely excluded based on two consecutively 
      negative respiratory pathogenic nucleic acid test results.

AB  - In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the 
      virus SARS-CoV-2, began in Wuhan, China (1). The disease spread widely in China, 
      and, as of February 26, 2020, COVID-19 cases had been identified in 36 other 
      countries and territories, including the United States. Person-to-person 
      transmission has been widely documented, and a limited number of countries have 
      reported sustained person-to-person spread.* On January 20, state and local health 
      departments in the United States, in collaboration with teams deployed from CDC, 
      began identifying and monitoring all persons considered to have had close contact(†) 
      with patients with confirmed COVID-19 (2). The aims of these efforts were to ensure 
      rapid evaluation and care of patients, limit further transmission, and better 
      understand risk factors for transmission.

TI  - Potential Rapid Diagnostics, Vaccine and Therapeutics for 2019 Novel Coronavirus 
      (2019-nCoV): A Systematic Review.
LID - E623 [pii]

AB  - Rapid diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics are important interventions for the 
      management of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak. It is timely to 
      systematically review the potential of these interventions, including those for 
      Middle East respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome (SARS)-CoV, to guide policymakers globally on their prioritization of 
      resources for research and development. A systematic search was carried out in three 
      major electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify 
      published studies in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
      Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Supplementary strategies through 
      Google Search and personal communications were used. A total of 27 studies fulfilled 
      the criteria for review. Several laboratory protocols for confirmation of suspected 
      2019-nCoV cases using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction 
      (RT-PCR) have been published. A commercial RT-PCR kit developed by the Beijing 
      Genomic Institute is currently widely used in China and likely in Asia. However, 
      serological assays as well as point-of-care testing kits have not been developed but 
      are likely in the near future. Several vaccine candidates are in the pipeline. The 
      likely earliest Phase 1 vaccine trial is a synthetic DNA-based candidate. A number 
      of novel compounds as well as therapeutics licensed for other conditions appear to 
      have in vitro efficacy against the 2019-nCoV. Some are being tested in clinical 
      trials against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, while others have been listed for clinical 
      trials against 2019-nCoV. However, there are currently no effective specific 
      antivirals or drug combinations supported by high-level evidence.

AB  - In December 2019, a new coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, has emerged from China 
      causing pneumonia outbreaks first in the Wuhan region and have now spread worldwide 
      because of its probable high transmission efficiency. Due to the lack of efficient 
      and specific treatments and the need to contain the epidemic, drug repurposing 
      appears to be the best tool to find therapeutic solution. Chloroquine, remdesivir, 
      lopinavir, ribavirin or ritonavir have shown efficacy to inhibit coronavirus in 
      vitro. Teicoplanin, an antibiotic used to treat staphylococci infection, previously 
      showed efficacy to inhibit the first stage of MERS-coronarivus viral cycle in human 
      cells. This activity is conserved on the SARS-Cov-2, thus placing teicoplanin as a 
      potential treatment for patients with this virus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a 
      novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). We report the 
      epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and 
      treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients. METHODS: All patients with 
      suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan. We 
      prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 
      2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Data were 
      obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International 
      Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical 
      records. Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to 
      ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. Outcomes were also compared between 
      patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had 
      not. FINDINGS: By Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as 
      having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Most of the infected patients were 
      men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including 
      diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six 
      [15%]). Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0-58·0). 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been 
      exposed to Huanan seafood market. One family cluster was found. Common symptoms at 
      onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia 
      or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), 
      headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] 
      of 38). Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness 
      onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0-13·0]). 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia. 
      All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT. Complications 
      included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute 
      cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]). 13 (32%) patients 
      were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU 
      patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and 
      TNFα. INTERPRETATION: The 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory 
      illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated 
      with ICU admission and high mortality. Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, 
      epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need 
      fulfilment by future studies. FUNDING: Ministry of Science and Technology, Chinese

AB  - In December 2019, China diagnosed the first patient with 2019 novel coronavirus 
      disease (COVID-19), and the following development of the epidemic had a huge impact 
      on China and the whole world. For patients with lung occupying lesions, the whole 
      process of diagnosis and treatment can not be carried out as usual due to the 
      epidemic. For thoracic surgeons, the timing of surgical intervention should be very 
      carefully considered. All thoracic surgeons in China should work together to develop 
      the proper procedures for the diagnosis and treatment in this special situation, and 
      continuously update the recommendations based on epidemic changes and further 
      understanding of COVID-19. Here, we only offer some preliminary suggestions based on 
      our own knowledge for further reference and discussion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In December, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel 
      coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China. We aimed to further clarify the 
      epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia. METHODS: In 
      this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 
      2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were 
      confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, 
      clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data. Outcomes were followed up 
      until Jan 25, 2020. FINDINGS: Of the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) 
      had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. The average age of the 
      patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women. 2019-nCoV was 
      detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR. 50 (51%) patients had chronic 
      diseases. Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough 
      (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] 
      patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore 
      throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] 
      patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] 
      patient). According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral 
      pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and 
      one (1%) patient had pneumothorax. 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory 
      distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of 
      time and died of multiple organ failure. INTERPRETATION: The 2019-nCoV infection was 
      of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and 
      can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory 
      distress syndrome. In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line 
      with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral 
      pneumonia. Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the 
      MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection. FUNDING:

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical characteristics of patients in Zhejiang province, 
      China, infected with the 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-Cov-2) responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-2019). DESIGN: 
      Retrospective case series. SETTING: Seven hospitals in Zhejiang province, China. 
      PARTICIPANTS: 62 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed SARS-Cov-2 
      infection. Data were collected from 10 January 2020 to 26 January 2020. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: Clinical data, collected using a standardised case report form, such as 
      temperature, history of exposure, incubation period. If information was not clear, 
      the working group in Hangzhou contacted the doctor responsible for treating the 
      patient for clarification. RESULTS: Of the 62 patients studied (median age 41 
      years), only one was admitted to an intensive care unit, and no patients died during 
      the study. According to research, none of the infected patients in Zhejiang province 
      were ever exposed to the Huanan seafood market, the original source of the virus; 
      all studied cases were infected by human to human transmission. The most common 
      symptoms at onset of illness were fever in 48 (77%) patients, cough in 50 (81%), 
      expectoration in 35 (56%), headache in 21 (34%), myalgia or fatigue in 32 (52%), 
      diarrhoea in 3 (8%), and haemoptysis in 2 (3%). Only two patients (3%) developed 
      shortness of breath on admission. The median time from exposure to onset of illness 
      was 4 days (interquartile range 3-5 days), and from onset of symptoms to first 
      hospital admission was 2 (1-4) days. CONCLUSION: As of early February 2020, compared 
      with patients initially infected with SARS-Cov-2 in Wuhan, the symptoms of patients 
      in Zhejiang province are relatively mild.

AB  - The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infected patients by binding human ACE2, 
      leading to severe pneumonia and highly mortality rate in patients. At present, there 
      is no definite and effective treatment for COVID-19. ACE2 plays an important role in 
      the RAS, and the imbalance between ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway and ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas 
      receptor pathway in the RAS system will lead to multi-system inflammation. Increased 
      ACE and Ang II are poor prognostic factors for severe pneumonia. Animal studies have 
      shown that RAS inhibitors could effectively relieve symptoms of acute severe 
      pneumonia and respiratory failure. The binding of COVID-19 and ACE2 resulted in the 
      exhaustion of ACE2, and then ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway was inhibited. The 
      balance of the RAS system was broken, and this would lead to the exacerbation of 
      acute severe pneumonia. Therefore, we speculate that ACEI and AT1R inhibitors could 
      be used in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia under the condition of controlling blood 
      pressure, and might reduce the pulmonary inflammatory response and mortality.

AB  - Pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is continuously and 
      rapidly circulating at present. No effective antiviral treatment has been verified 
      thus far. We report here the clinical characteristics and therapeutic procedure for 
      four patients with mild or severe 2019-nCoV pneumonia admitted to Shanghai Public 
      Health Clinical Center. All the patients were given antiviral treatment including 
      lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra(®)), arbidol, and Shufeng Jiedu Capsule (SFJDC, a 
      traditional Chinese medicine) and other necessary support care. After treatment, 
      three patients gained significant improvement in pneumonia associated symptoms, two 
      of whom were confirmed 2019-nCoV negative and discharged, and one of whom was virus 
      negative at the first test. The remaining patient with severe pneumonia had shown 
      signs of improvement by the cutoff date for data collection. Results obtained in the 
      current study may provide clues for treatment of 2019-nCoV pneumonia. The efficacy 
      of antiviral treatment including lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol, and SFJDC warrants 
      further verification in future study.

TI  - Immediate Psychological Responses and Associated Factors during the Initial Stage of 
      the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Epidemic among the General Population in 
      China.
LID - E1729 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph17051729 [doi]
AB  - Background: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic is a public health 
      emergency of international concern and poses a challenge to psychological 
      resilience. Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce 
      adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the epidemic. The aim 
      of this study was to survey the general public in China to better understand their 
      levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the initial 
      stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. The data will be used for future reference. Methods: 
      From 31 January to 2 February 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball 
      sampling techniques. The online survey collected information on demographic data, 
      physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact history with COVID-19, knowledge and 
      concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures against COVID-19, and additional 
      information required with respect to COVID-19. Psychological impact was assessed by 
      the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by 
      the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Results: This study included 
      1210 respondents from 194 cities in China. In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the 
      psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate 
      to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; 
      and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels. Most respondents spent 20-24 h 
      per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting 
      COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available 
      (75.1%). Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.g., myalgia, 
      dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated 
      with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, 
      anxiety, and depression (p < 0.05). Specific up-to-date and accurate health 
      information (e.g., treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary 
      measures (e.g., hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower 
      psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and 
      depression (p < 0.05). Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 
      outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact 
      as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety. Our 
      findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and 
      better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological 
      interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 
      epidemic.

TI  - In Vitro Antiviral Activity and Projection of Optimized Dosing Design of 
      Hydroxychloroquine for the Treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 
      Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
LID - ciaa237 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciaa237 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first 
      broke out in Wuhan (China) and subsequently spread worldwide. Chloroquine has been 
      sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hydroxychloroquine shares the 
      same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes 
      it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions. We propose that 
      the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling 
      the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected 
      patients. Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine 
      in SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: The pharmacological activity of chloroquine and 
      hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells. 
      Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) were implemented for both drugs 
      separately by integrating their in vitro data. Using the PBPK models, 
      hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different 
      dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen whilst considering the drug's 
      safety profile. RESULTS: Hydroxychloroquine (EC50=0.72 μM) was found to be more 
      potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47 μM) in vitro. Based on PBPK models results, a 
      loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, 
      followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended 
      for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it reached three times the potency of chloroquine 
      phosphate when given 500 mg twice daily 5 days in advance. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Hydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine to inhibit 
      SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.

AB  - Objective: To describe the epidemiological characteristics of a cluster of COVID-19 
      cases reported in Baodi district of Tianjin as of 18 February, 2020, which might be 
      associated with the exposure in a local department store, and provide suggestions 
      for prevention and control strategy development. Methods: The basic characteristics, 
      time and area distributions, clinical manifestations, epidemiological history and 
      transmission mode of the COVID-19 cases associated with the department store 
      exposure were analyzed. Results: A total of 40 COVID-19 cases were associated with 
      the department store exposure, accounting for 75.47% of the total confirmed cases 
      (53 cases) reported in Baodi district. The cases were mainly at the age of 60 years 
      or older (35.00%) and farmers (40.00%). The main clinical manifestations included 
      fever (95.00%), cough (35.00%), and diarrhea (15.00%). The proportion of confirmed 
      severe cases was 32.50%. The incidence curve showed that the incidence peak occurred 
      on 31 January, 2020. Among the 40 cases, 6(15.00%) were department store employees, 
      19(47.50%) were customers and 15(37.50%) were close contacts (secondary cases). The 
      first case occurred on 21 January, 2020, this case was a department store employee 
      who had a purchasing history at whole sale markets in other provinces and cities 
      before the onset, and 3 employees were still on duty after symptom onsets. The 
      median of the incubation period of customer cases was 6 days, and the median of the 
      interval between onset and medical treatment of customer cases was 7 days. 
      Conclusion: This was a cluster epidemic of COVID-19, which might be associated with 
      the exposure in the department store. By now, the current prevention and control 
      measures have achieved satisfied effects.

TI  - Clinical Characteristics of 138 Hospitalized Patients With 2019 Novel 
      Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia in Wuhan, China.
LID - 10.1001/jama.2020.1585 [doi]
LID - e201585
AB  - IMPORTANCE: In December 2019, novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia 
      (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, China. The number of cases has increased rapidly but 
      information on the clinical characteristics of affected patients is limited. 
      OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCIP. 
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective, single-center case series of the 
      138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP at Zhongnan Hospital of 
      Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from January 1 to January 28, 2020; final date of 
      follow-up was February 3, 2020. EXPOSURES: Documented NCIP. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and 
      treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of critically ill patients and 
      noncritically ill patients were compared. Presumed hospital-related transmission was 
      suspected if a cluster of health professionals or hospitalized patients in the same 
      wards became infected and a possible source of infection could be tracked. RESULTS: 
      Of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP, the median age was 56 years (interquartile 
      range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3%) were men. Hospital-associated 
      transmission was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for affected 
      health professionals (40 [29%]) and hospitalized patients (17 [12.3%]). Common 
      symptoms included fever (136 [98.6%]), fatigue (96 [69.6%]), and dry cough (82 
      [59.4%]). Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.8 × 109/L [interquartile range {IQR}, 
      0.6-1.1]) occurred in 97 patients (70.3%), prolonged prothrombin time (13.0 seconds 
      [IQR, 12.3-13.7]) in 80 patients (58%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (261 U/L 
      [IQR, 182-403]) in 55 patients (39.9%). Chest computed tomographic scans showed 
      bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Most 
      patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]), and many received 
      antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6%]; 
      azithromycin, 25 [18.1%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9%]). Thirty-six 
      patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of 
      complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1%]), 
      arrhythmia (16 [44.4%]), and shock (11 [30.6%]). The median time from first symptom 
      to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ARDS was 8.0 
      days. Patients treated in the ICU (n = 36), compared with patients not treated in 
      the ICU (n = 102), were older (median age, 66 years vs 51 years), were more likely 
      to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2%] vs 38 [37.3%]), and were more likely to 
      have dyspnea (23 [63.9%] vs 20 [19.6%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7%] vs 31 [30.4%]). Of 
      the 36 cases in the ICU, 4 (11.1%) received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 (41.7%) 
      received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2%) received invasive ventilation (4 
      were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). As of February 3, 47 patients 
      (34.1%) were discharged and 6 died (overall mortality, 4.3%), but the remaining 
      patients are still hospitalized. Among those discharged alive (n = 47), the median 
      hospital stay was 10 days (IQR, 7.0-14.0). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this 
      single-center case series of 138 hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP in Wuhan, 
      China, presumed hospital-related transmission of 2019-nCoV was suspected in 41% of 
      patients, 26% of patients received ICU care, and mortality was 4.3%.

AB  - Coronaviruses (CoVs) are by far the largest group of known positive-sense RNA 
      viruses having an extensive range of natural hosts. In the past few decades, newly 
      evolved Coronaviruses have posed a global threat to public health. The immune 
      response is essential to control and eliminate CoV infections, however, maladjusted 
      immune responses may result in immunopathology and impaired pulmonary gas exchange. 
      Gaining a deeper understanding of the interaction between Coronaviruses and the 
      innate immune systems of the hosts may shed light on the development and persistence 
      of inflammation in the lungs and hopefully can reduce the risk of lung inflammation 
      caused by CoVs. In this review, we provide an update on CoV infections and relevant 
      diseases, particularly the host defense against CoV-induced inflammation of lung 
      tissue, as well as the role of the innate immune system in the pathogenesis and 
      clinical treatment.

      However, one of the most important mechanism underlying the deterioration of disease 
      is cytokine storm. At present, some therapies such as interleukin-6 antibody 
      blocker, stem cell therapy, and transfusion of convalescent plasma have been applied 
      to counteract the cytokine storm and have made some progress. This article reviews 
      the influences of cytokine storm syndrome on the COVID-19 and the corresponding 
      immunotherapies to resist cytokine storm.

AB  - 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is one of the beta coronaviruses and was 
      identified as the pathogen of the severe "coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)" in 
      2019. China has formally included the 2019-nCoV in the statutory notification and 
      control system for infectious diseases according to the Law of the People's Republic 
      of China on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases. Currently, the 
      national defending actions on the 2019-nCoV in China is in a critical period. Burn 
      Department is also confronted with risk of infection by the 2019-nCoV. According to 
      the guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (6(th) trial edition), the 
      latest relative literature at home and abroad, the features of the COVID-19, 
      recommendations for the COVID-19 prevention and control issued by the National 
      Health Commission of China, and management experience of diagnosis and treatment in 
      the related disciplines, we put forward recommendations for the medical practices of 
      burn treatment during the outbreak of the COVID-19 in outpatient and emergency 
      treatment, inpatient treatment, operation and ward management, etc. We hope these 
      recommendations could benefit the professionals of the same occupation as us and 
      related hospital managers, improve the treatment of burn during the outbreak of the 
      COVID-19, and avoid or reduce the risk of infection of medical staff .

AB  - An acute respiratory disease, caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, previously 
      known as 2019-nCoV), the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread throughout 
      China and received worldwide attention. On 30 January 2020, World Health 
      Organization (WHO) officially declared the COVID-19 epidemic as a public health 
      emergency of international concern. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, since the severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and Middle East 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, marked the third introduction 
      of a highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic coronavirus into the human 
      population in the twenty-first century. As of 1 March 2020, a total of 87,137 
      confirmed cases globally, 79,968 confirmed in China and 7169 outside of China, with 
      2977 deaths (3.4%) had been reported by WHO. Meanwhile, several independent research 
      groups have identified that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to β-coronavirus, with highly 
      identical genome to bat coronavirus, pointing to bat as the natural host. The novel 
      coronavirus uses the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as that 
      for SARS-CoV, and mainly spreads through the respiratory tract. Importantly, 
      increasingly evidence showed sustained human-to-human transmission, along with many 
      exported cases across the globe. The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients include 
      fever, cough, fatigue and a small population of patients appeared gastrointestinal 
      infection symptoms. The elderly and people with underlying diseases are susceptible 
      to infection and prone to serious outcomes, which may be associated with acute 
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm. Currently, there are few 
      specific antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and 
      repurposed drugs are under urgent investigation. In this review, we summarized the 
      latest research progress of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical 
      characteristics of COVID-19, and discussed the current treatment and scientific 
      advancements to combat the epidemic novel coronavirus.

AB  - Some patients with positive chest CT findings may present with negative results of 
      real time reverse-transcription-polymerase chain- reaction (RT-PCR) for 2019 novel 
      coronavirus (2019-nCoV). In this report, we present chest CT findings from five 
      patients with 2019-nCoV infection who had initial negative RT-PCR results. All five 
      patients had typical imaging findings, including ground-glass opacity (GGO) (5 
      patients) and/or mixed GGO and mixed consolidation (2 patients). After isolation for 
      presumed 2019-nCoV pneumonia, all patients were eventually confirmed with 2019-nCoV 
      infection by repeated swab tests. A combination of repeated swab tests and CT 
      scanning may be helpful when for individuals with high clinical suspicion of nCoV 
      infection but negative RT-PCR screening.

AB  - The newly identified 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused more than 11,900 
      laboratory-confirmed human infections, including 259 deaths, posing a serious threat 
      to human health. Currently, however, there is no specific antiviral treatment or 
      vaccine. Considering the relatively high identity of receptor-binding domain (RBD) 
      in 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, it is urgent to assess the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS 
      CoV antibodies with 2019-nCoV spike protein, which could have important implications 
      for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against 2019-nCoV. 
      Here, we report for the first time that a SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal 
      antibody, CR3022, could bind potently with 2019-nCoV RBD (KD of 6.3 nM). The epitope 
      of CR3022 does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site within 2019-nCoV RBD. These 
      results suggest that CR3022 may have the potential to be developed as candidate 
      therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the 
      prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infections. Interestingly, some of the most 
      potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.g. m396, CR3014) that target the 
      ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, implying that 
      the difference in the RBD of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV has a critical impact for the 
      cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies, and that it is still necessary to 
      develop novel monoclonal antibodies that could bind specifically to 2019-nCoV RBD.

TI  - Development of a Laboratory-safe and Low-cost Detection Protocol for SARS-CoV-2 of 
      the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
LID - 10.5607/en20009 [doi]
AB  - The severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which emerged in December 
      2019 in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly to over a dozen countries. Especially, the 
      spike of case numbers in South Korea sparks pandemic worries. This virus is reported 
      to spread mainly through personto- person contact via respiratory droplets generated 
      by coughing and sneezing, or possibly through surface contaminated by people 
      coughing or sneezing on them. More critically, there have been reports about the 
      possibility of this virus to transmit even before a virus-carrying person to show 
      symptoms. Therefore, a low-cost, easy-access protocol for early detection of this 
      virus is desperately needed. Here, we have established a real-time 
      reverse-transcription PCR (rtPCR)-based assay protocol composed of easy specimen 
      self-collection from a subject via pharyngeal swab, Trizolbased RNA purification, 
      and SYBR Green-based rtPCR. This protocol shows an accuracy and sensitivity limit of 
      1-10 virus particles as we tested with a known lentivirus. The cost for each sample 
      is estimated to be less than 15 US dollars. Overall time it takes for an entire 
      protocol is estimated to be less than 4 hours. We propose a cost-effective, 
      quick-and-easy method for early detection of SARS-CoV-2 at any conventional 
      Biosafety Level II laboratories that are equipped with a rtPCR machine. Our newly 
      developed protocol should be helpful for a first-hand screening of the asymptomatic 
      virus-carriers for further prevention of transmission and early intervention and 
      treatment for the rapidly propagating virus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since Dec 31, 2019, the Chinese city of Wuhan has reported an outbreak 
      of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Cases have 
      been exported to other Chinese cities, as well as internationally, threatening to 
      trigger a global outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the size of the epidemic 
      in Wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside 
      mainland China and forecast the extent of the domestic and global public health 
      risks of epidemics, accounting for social and non-pharmaceutical prevention 
      interventions. METHODS: We used data from Dec 31, 2019, to Jan 28, 2020, on the 
      number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally (known days of symptom onset 
      from Dec 25, 2019, to Jan 19, 2020) to infer the number of infections in Wuhan from 
      Dec 1, 2019, to Jan 25, 2020. Cases exported domestically were then estimated. We 
      forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of 
      the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 
      23-24, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation 
      Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in 
      mainland China from the Tencent database. Data on confirmed cases were obtained from 
      the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. 
      Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered 
      metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in 
      China. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo 
      methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval 
      (CrI). FINDINGS: In our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive 
      number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·47-2·86) and that 75 815 individuals (95% 
      CrI 37 304-130 330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic 
      doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·8-7·1). We estimated that in the baseline 
      scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 
      (95% CrI 227-805), 113 (57-193), 98 (49-168), 111 (56-191), and 80 (40-139) 
      infections from Wuhan, respectively. If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were 
      similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are 
      already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time 
      behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1-2 weeks. INTERPRETATION: Given that 2019-nCoV 
      is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably 
      sustaining localised outbreaks. Large cities overseas with close transport links to 
      China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health 
      interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented 
      immediately. Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could 
      become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in 
      the absence of large-scale public health interventions. Preparedness plans and 
      mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally. FUNDING:

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in 
      Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has spread globally with sustained human-to-human 
      transmission outside China. OBJECTIVE: To report the initial experience in Singapore 
      with the epidemiologic investigation of this outbreak, clinical features, and 
      management. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Descriptive case series of the first 
      18 patients diagnosed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 
      infection at 4 hospitals in Singapore from January 23 to February 3, 2020; final 
      follow-up date was February 25, 2020. EXPOSURES: Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
      MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data were 
      collected, including PCR cycle threshold values from nasopharyngeal swabs and viral 
      shedding in blood, urine, and stool. Clinical course was summarized, including 
      requirement for supplemental oxygen and intensive care and use of empirical 
      treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir. RESULTS: Among the 18 hospitalized patients with 
      PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (median age, 47 years; 9 [50%] women), clinical 
      presentation was an upper respiratory tract infection in 12 (67%), and viral 
      shedding from the nasopharynx was prolonged for 7 days or longer among 15 (83%). Six 
      individuals (33%) required supplemental oxygen; of these, 2 required intensive care. 
      There were no deaths. Virus was detectable in the stool (4/8 [50%]) and blood (1/12 
      [8%]) by PCR but not in urine. Five individuals requiring supplemental oxygen were 
      treated with lopinavir-ritonavir. For 3 of the 5 patients, fever resolved and 
      supplemental oxygen requirement was reduced within 3 days, whereas 2 deteriorated 
      with progressive respiratory failure. Four of the 5 patients treated with 
      lopinavir-ritonavir developed nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea, and 3 developed 
      abnormal liver function test results. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among the first 18 
      patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Singapore, clinical presentation was 
      frequently a mild respiratory tract infection. Some patients required supplemental 
      oxygen and had variable clinical outcomes following treatment with an antiretroviral 
      agent.

TI  - Clinical characteristics of refractory COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, China.
LID - ciaa270 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciaa270 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since December 2019, novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-infected pneumonia 
      (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, and rapidly spread throughout China. This study aimed 
      to clarify the characteristics of patients with refractory COVID-19. METHODS: In 
      this retrospective single-center study, we included 155 consecutive patients with 
      confirmed COVID-19 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 1st to 
      February 5th. The cases were divided into general and refractory COVID-19 groups 
      according to the clinical efficacy after hospitalization, and the difference between 
      groups were compared. RESULTS: Compared with general COVID-19 patients (45.2%), 
      refractory patients had an older age, male sex, more underlying comorbidities, lower 
      incidence of fever, higher levels of maximum temperature among fever cases, higher 
      incidence of breath shortness and anorexia, severer disease assessment on admission, 
      high levels of neutrophil, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase 
      (LDH) and C-reactive protein, lower levels of platelets and albumin, and higher 
      incidence of bilateral pneumonia and pleural effusion (P<0.05). Refractory COVID-19 
      patients were more likely to receive oxygen, mechanical ventilation, expectorant, 
      and adjunctive treatment including corticosteroid, antiviral drugs and immune 
      enhancer (P<0.05). After adjustment, those with refractory COVID-19 were also more 
      likely to have a male sex and manifestations of anorexia and fever on admission, and 
      receive oxygen, expectorant and adjunctive agents (P<0.05) when considering the 
      factors of disease severity on admission, mechanical ventilation, and ICU transfer. 
      CONCLUSION: Nearly 50% COVID-19 patients could not reach obvious clinical and 
      radiological remission within 10 days after hospitalization. The patients with male 
      sex, anorexia and no fever on admission predicted poor efficacy.

      children: experts' consensus statement.
LID - 10.1007/s12519-020-00343-7 [doi]
AB  - Since the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan City, 
      China, by January 30, 2020, a total of 9692 confirmed cases and 15,238 suspected 
      cases have been reported around 31 provinces or cities in China. Among the confirmed 
      cases, 1527 were severe cases, 171 had recovered and been discharged at home, and 
      213 died. And among these cases, a total of 28 children aged from 1 month to 
      17 years have been reported in China. For standardizing prevention and management of 
      2019-nCoV infections in children, we called up an experts' committee to formulate 
      this experts' consensus statement. This statement is based on the Novel Coronavirus 
      Infection Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Standards (the fourth edition) (National 
      Health Committee) and other previous diagnosis and treatment strategies for 
      pediatric virus infections. The present consensus statement summarizes current 
      strategies on diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of 2019-nCoV infection in 
      children.

      infection.
PG  - 315-328
LID - 10.1007/s00134-020-05943-5 [doi]
AB  - With the expanding use of molecular assays, viral pathogens are increasingly 
      recognized among critically ill adult patients with community-acquired severe 
      respiratory illness; studies have detected respiratory viral infections (RVIs) in 
      17-53% of such patients. In addition, novel pathogens including zoonotic 
      coronaviruses like the agents causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), 
      Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) 
      are still being identified. Patients with severe RVIs requiring ICU care present 
      typically with hypoxemic respiratory failure. Oseltamivir is the most widely used 
      neuraminidase inhibitor for treatment of influenza; data suggest that early use is 
      associated with reduced mortality in critically ill patients with influenza. At 
      present, there are no antiviral therapies of proven efficacy for other severe RVIs. 
      Several adjunctive pharmacologic interventions have been studied for their 
      immunomodulatory effects, including macrolides, corticosteroids, cyclooxygenase-2 
      inhibitors, sirolimus, statins, anti-influenza immune plasma, and vitamin C, but 
      none is recommended at present in severe RVIs. Evidence-based supportive care is the 
      mainstay for management of severe respiratory viral infection. Non-invasive 
      ventilation in patients with severe RVI causing acute hypoxemic respiratory failure 
      and pneumonia is associated with a high likelihood of transition to invasive 
      ventilation. Limited existing knowledge highlights the need for data regarding 
      supportive care and adjunctive pharmacologic therapy that is specific for critically 
      ill patients with severe RVI. There is a need for more pragmatic and efficient 
      designs to test different therapeutics both individually and in combination.

AB  - With the increasing number of cases and widening geographical spread, the 2019 novel 
      coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been classified as one of the class B infectious 
      diseases but prevented and controlled as class A infectious disease by the National 
      Health Commission of China. The diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer patients have 
      been challenged greatly because of extraordinary public health measures since the 
      lung cancer patients are a high-risk population during the COVID-19 outbreak period. 
      Strict protection for lung cancer patients is needed to avoid infection. Lung cancer 
      patients are difficult to differentiate from patients with COVID-19 in terms of 
      clinical symptoms, which will bring great trouble to the clinical work and physical 
      and mental health of lung cancer patients. This review will demonstrate how to 
      applicate appropriate and individual management for lung cancer patients to protect 
      them from COVID-19.

AB  - Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is an emerging pathogen that was first identified in 
      Wuhan, China in late December 2019. This virus is responsible for the ongoing 
      outbreak that causes severe respiratory illness and pneumonia-like infection in 
      humans. Due to the increasing number of cases in China and outside China, the WHO 
      declared coronavirus as a global health emergency. Nearly 35,000 cases were reported 
      and at least 24 other countries or territories have reported coronavirus cases as 
      early on as February. Inter-human transmission was reported in a few countries, 
      including the United States. Neither an effective anti-viral nor a vaccine is 
      currently available to treat this infection. As the virus is a newly emerging 
      pathogen, many questions remain unanswered regarding the virus's reservoirs, 
      pathogenesis, transmissibility, and much more is unknown. The collaborative efforts 
      of researchers are needed to fill the knowledge gaps about this new virus, to 
      develop the proper diagnostic tools, and effective treatment to combat this 
      infection. Recent advancements in plant biotechnology proved that plants have the 
      ability to produce vaccines or biopharmaceuticals rapidly in a short time. In this 
      review, the outbreak of 2019-nCoV in China, the need for rapid vaccine development, 
      and the potential of a plant system for biopharmaceutical development are discussed.

AB  - In late December 2019, a cluster of unexplained pneumonia cases has been reported in 
      Wuhan, China. A few days later, the causative agent of this mysterious pneumonia was 
      identified as a novel coronavirus. This causative virus has been temporarily named 
      as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the relevant 
      infected disease has been named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World 
      Health Organization respectively. The COVID-19 epidemic is spreading in China and 
      all over the world now. The purpose of this review is primarily to review the 
      pathogen, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19, but also to 
      comment briefly on the epidemiology and pathology based on the current evidences.

TI  - Clinical characteristics of novel coronavirus cases in tertiary hospitals in Hubei 
      Province.
LID - 10.1097/CM9.0000000000000744 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) causing an outbreak of pneumonia in 
      Wuhan, Hubei province of China was isolated in January 2020. This study aims to 
      investigate its epidemiologic history, and analyze the clinical characteristics, 
      treatment regimens, and prognosis of patients infected with 2019-nCoV during this 
      outbreak. METHODS: Clinical data from 137 2019-nCoV-infected patients admitted to 
      the respiratory departments of the respiratory departments of nine tertiary 
      hospitals in Hubei province from December 30, 2019 to January 24, 2020 were 
      retrospectively collected, including general status, clinical manifestations, 
      laboratory test results, imaging characteristics, and treatment regimens. RESULTS: 
      None of the 137 patients (61 males, 76 females, aged 20-83 years, median age 57 
      years) had a definite history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Major 
      initial symptoms included fever (112/137, 81.8%), coughing (66/137, 48.2%), and 
      muscle pain or fatigue (44/137, 32.1%), with other, less typical initial symptoms 
      observed at low frequency, including heart palpitations, diarrhea, and headache. 
      Nearly 80% of the patients had normal or decreased white blood cell counts, and 
      72.3% (99/137) had lymphocytopenia. Lung involvement was present in all cases, with 
      most chest computed tomography scans showing lesions in multiple lung lobes, some of 
      which were dense; ground-glass opacity co-existed with consolidation shadows or 
      cord-like shadows. Given the lack of effective drugs, treatment focused on 
      symptomatic and respiratory support. Immunoglobulin G was delivered to some 
      critically ill patients according to their conditions. Systemic corticosteroid 
      treatment did not show significant benefits. Notably, early respiratory support 
      facilitated disease recovery and improved prognosis. The risk of death was primarily 
      associated with age, underlying chronic diseases, and median interval from the 
      appearance of initial symptoms to dyspnea. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients 
      with 2019-nCoV pneumonia present with fever as the first symptom, and most of them 
      still showed typical manifestations of viral pneumonia on chest imaging. Middle-aged 
      and elderly patients with underlying comorbidities are susceptible to respiratory 
      failure and may have a poorer prognosis.

AB  - Respiratory tract viral infection caused by viruses or bacteria is one of the most 
      common diseases in human worldwide, while those caused by emerging viruses, such as 
      the novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV that caused the pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China 
      most recently, have posed great threats to global public health. Identification of 
      the causative viral pathogens of respiratory tract viral infections is important to 
      select an appropriate treatment, save people's lives, stop the epidemics, and avoid 
      unnecessary use of antibiotics. Conventional diagnostic tests, such as the assays 
      for rapid detection of antiviral antibodies or viral antigens, are widely used in 
      many clinical laboratories. With the development of modern technologies, new 
      diagnostic strategies, including multiplex nucleic acid amplification and 
      microarray-based assays, are emerging. This review summarizes currently available 
      and novel emerging diagnostic methods for the detection of common respiratory 
      viruses, such as influenza virus, human respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, 
      human adenovirus, and human rhinovirus. Multiplex assays for simultaneous detection 
      of multiple respiratory viruses are also described. It is anticipated that such data 
      will assist researchers and clinicians to develop appropriate diagnostic strategies 
      for timely and effective detection of respiratory virus infections.

AB  - Currently, the epidemic of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is still ongoing. The 
      characteristics including high contagiousness, herd susceptibility and clinical 
      phenotype diversity, made a serious influence on people's daily life and rountine 
      therapy for other diseases. Breast dieases are clinical common diseases. In the 
      central epidemic area of COVID-19, Hubei province, especially Wuhan, the clinical 
      specialists of breast diseases should consider all of the following factors 
      comprehensively: the prevention of COVID-19, the diagnosis and treatment of breast 
      diseases and the accessibility of medical resources. Besides, we should select the 
      appropriate therapy and optimize treatment process so as to prevent the propagation 
      and cross infection of COVID-19 as well as manage the breast diseases without delay. 
      Therefore, we carried out some management proposals of the patients with breast 
      diseases in the central epidemic area during the epidemic of COVID-19 on the basis 
      of conventional treatment guidelines and clinical experiences. The suggestions and 
      corrections from colleagues will be welcomed.

AB  - On December 31, 2019, Chinese health officials reported a cluster of cases of acute 
      respiratory illness in persons associated with the Hunan seafood and animal market 
      in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, in central China. On January 7, 2020, Chinese 
      health officials confirmed that a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was associated with 
      this initial cluster (1). As of February 4, 2020, a total of 20,471 confirmed cases, 
      including 2,788 (13.6%) with severe illness,* and 425 deaths (2.1%) had been 
      reported by the National Health Commission of China (2). Cases have also been 
      reported in 26 locations outside of mainland China, including documentation of some 
      person-to-person transmission and one death (2). As of February 4, 11 cases had been 
      reported in the United States. On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) 
      Director-General declared that the 2019-nCoV outbreak constitutes a Public Health 
      Emergency of International Concern.(†) On January 31, the U.S. Department of Health 
      and Human Services (HHS) Secretary declared a U.S. public health emergency to 
      respond to 2019-nCoV.(§) Also on January 31, the president of the United States 
      signed a "Proclamation on Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of 
      Persons who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirus," which limits entry 
      into the United States of persons who traveled to mainland China to U.S. citizens 
      and lawful permanent residents and their families (3). CDC, multiple other federal 
      agencies, state and local health departments, and other partners are implementing 
      aggressive measures to slow transmission of 2019-nCoV in the United States (4,5). 
      These measures require the identification of cases and their contacts in the United 
      States and the appropriate assessment and care of travelers arriving from mainland 
      China to the United States. These measures are being implemented in anticipation of 
      additional 2019-nCoV cases in the United States. Although these measures might not 
      prevent the eventual establishment of ongoing, widespread transmission of the virus 
      in the United States, they are being implemented to 1) slow the spread of illness; 
      2) provide time to better prepare health care systems and the general public to be 
      ready if widespread transmission with substantial associated illness occurs; and 3) 
      better characterize 2019-nCoV infection to guide public health recommendations and 
      the development of medical countermeasures including diagnostics, therapeutics, and 
      vaccines. Public health authorities are monitoring the situation closely. As more is 
      learned about this novel virus and this outbreak, CDC will rapidly incorporate new 
      knowledge into guidance for action by CDC and state and local health departments.

AB  - The outbreak of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV in Wuhan, Hubei 
      province of China, at the end of 2019 shaped tremendous challenges to China's public 
      health and clinical treatment. The virus belongs to the β genus Coronavirus in the 
      family Corornaviridae, and is closely related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing 
      severe symptoms of pneumonia. The virus is transmitted through droplets, close 
      contact, and other means, and patients in the incubation period could potentially 
      transmit the virus to other persons. According to current observations, 2019-nCoV is 
      weaker than SARS in pathogenesis, but has stronger transmission competence; it's 
      mechanism of cross-species spread might be related with angiotensin-converting 
      enzyme Ⅱ (ACE2), which is consistent with the receptor SARS-CoV. After the outbreak 
      of this disease, Chinese scientists invested a lot of energy to carry out research 
      by developing rapid diagnostic reagents, identifying the characters of the pathogen, 
      screening out clinical drugs that may inhibit the virus, and are rapidly developing 
      vaccines. The emergence of 2019-nCoV reminds us once again of the importance of 
      establishing a systematic coronavirus surveillance network. It also poses new 
      challenges to prevention and control of the emerging epidemic and rapidly responses 
      on scientific research.

AB  - The New Coronavirus Pneumonia (NCP, also named as COVID-19 by WHO on Feb 11 2020, is 
      now causing a severe public health emergency in China since. The number of diagnosed 
      cases is more than 40,000 until the submission of this manuscript. Coronavirus has 
      caused several epidemic situations world widely, but the present contagious disease 
      caused by 2019 new Coronavirus is unprecedentedly fulminating. The published cohorts 
      of 2019 new Coronavirus (n-Cov) are single-center studies, or retrospective studies. 
      We here share the therapeutic experiences of NCP treatment with literature review. 
      Combination of Ribavirin and Interferon-α is recommended by the 5(th) edition 
      National Health Commission's Regimen (Revised Edition) because of the effect on MERS 
      (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), and the effectiveness of Lopinavir/Ritonavir and 
      Remdisivir needs to be confirmed by randomized controlled trial (RCT), given the 
      situation of no specific antivirus drug on NCP is unavailable. Systemic 
      glucocorticosteroid is recommended as a short term use (1~2 mg.kg(-1).d(-1), 3~5d ) 
      by the 5(th) edition National Health Commission's Regimen (Revised Edition) yet RCTs 
      are expected to confirm the effectiveness. Inappropriate application of antibiotics 
      should be avoided, especially the combination of broad-spectrum antibiotics, for the 
      NCP is not often complicated with bacterial infection.

TI  - Persistence and clearance of viral RNA in 2019 novel coronavirus disease 
      rehabilitation patients.
LID - 10.1097/CM9.0000000000000774 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A patient's infectivity is determined by the presence of the virus in 
      different body fluids, secretions, and excreta. The persistence and clearance of 
      viral RNA from different specimens of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease 
      (COVID-19) remain unclear. This study analyzed the clearance time and factors 
      influencing 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RNA in different samples from 
      patients with COVID-19, providing further evidence to improve the management of 
      patients during convalescence. METHODS: The clinical data and laboratory test 
      results of convalescent patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to from January 20, 
      2020 to February 10, 2020 were collected retrospectively. The reverse transcription 
      polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for patients' oropharyngeal swab, stool, 
      urine, and serum samples were collected and analyzed. Convalescent patients refer to 
      recovered non-febrile patients without respiratory symptoms who had two successive 
      (minimum 24 h sampling interval) negative RT-PCR results for viral RNA from 
      oropharyngeal swabs. The effects of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+ T 
      lymphocytes, inflammatory indicators, and glucocorticoid treatment on viral nucleic 
      acid clearance were analyzed. RESULTS: In the 292 confirmed cases, 66 patients 
      recovered after treatment and were included in our study. In total, 28 (42.4%) women 
      and 38 men (57.6%) with a median age of 44.0 (34.0-62.0) years were analyzed. After 
      in-hospital treatment, patients' inflammatory indicators decreased with improved 
      clinical condition. The median time from the onset of symptoms to first negative 
      RT-PCR results for oropharyngeal swabs in convalescent patients was 9.5 (6.0-11.0) 
      days. By February 10, 2020, 11 convalescent patients (16.7%) still tested positive 
      for viral RNA from stool specimens and the other 55 patients' stool specimens were 
      negative for 2019-nCoV following a median duration of 11.0 (9.0-16.0) days after 
      symptom onset. Among these 55 patients, 43 had a longer duration until stool 
      specimens were negative for viral RNA than for throat swabs, with a median delay of 
      2.0 (1.0-4.0) days. Results for only four (6.9%) urine samples were positive for 
      viral nucleic acid out of 58 cases; viral RNA was still present in three patients' 
      urine specimens after throat swabs were negative. Using a multiple linear regression 
      model (F = 2.669, P = 0.044, and adjusted R = 0.122), the analysis showed that the 
      CD4+ T lymphocyte count may help predict the duration of viral RNA detection in 
      patients' stools (t = -2.699, P = 0.010). The duration of viral RNA detection from 
      oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was 
      longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (15 days vs. 8.0 days, 
      respectively; t = 2.550, P = 0.013) and the duration of viral RNA detection in fecal 
      samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the 
      non-glucocorticoid treatment group (20 days vs. 11 days, respectively; t = 4.631, 
      P < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in inflammatory 
      indicators between patients with positive fecal viral RNA test results and those 
      with negative results (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In brief, as the clearance of viral 
      RNA in patients' stools was delayed compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs, it is 
      important to identify viral RNA in feces during convalescence. Because of the 
      delayed clearance of viral RNA in the glucocorticoid treatment group, 
      glucocorticoids are not recommended in the treatment of COVID-19, especially for 
      mild disease. The duration of RNA detection may relate to host cell immunity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute 
      respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China. 
      Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce. We 
      aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with 
      SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. METHODS: In this single-centered, retrospective, observational 
      study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who 
      were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, 
      China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, 
      laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all 
      collected. Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. The primary 
      outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included 
      incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the 
      proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation. FINDINGS: Of 710 patients 
      with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included. The mean 
      age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had 
      chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever. 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and 
      the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 
      (IQR 3-11) days for non-survivors. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older 
      (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] 
      patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 
      [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively. Most 
      patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with 
      acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, 
      and one (2%) with pneumothorax. 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation. 
      Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients. INTERPRETATION: The 
      mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable. The 
      survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1-2 weeks after ICU 
      admission. Older patients (>65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased 
      risk of death. The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical 
      care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or 
      resourced. FUNDING: None.

AB  - An outbreak of respiratory illness proved to be infected by a 2019 novel 
      coronavirus, officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), was notified 
      first in Wuhan, China, and has spread rapidly in China and to other parts of the 
      world. Herein, we reported the first confirmed case of novel coronavirus pneumonia 
      (NCP) imported from China in Taiwan. This case report revealed a natural course of 
      NCP with self-recovery, which may be a good example in comparison with medical 
      treatments.

TI  - Repurposing of clinically approved drugs for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 
      in a 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) related coronavirus model.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Medicines for the treatment of 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) 
      infections are urgently needed. However, drug screening using live 2019-nCoV 
      requires high-level biosafety facilities, which imposes an obstacle for those 
      without such facilities or 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). This study aims to 
      repurpose the clinically approved drugs for the treatment of coronavirus disease 
      2019 (COVID-19) in a 2019-nCoV related coronavirus model. METHODS: A 2019-nCoV 
      related pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V/pangolin/2017/ Guangxi was described. Whether 
      GX_P2X uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the cell receptor was 
      investigated by using small interfering RNA (siRNA) -mediated silencing of ACE2. The 
      pangolin coronavirus model was used to identify drug candidates for treating 
      2019-nCoV infection. Two libraries of 2406 clinically approved drugs were screened 
      for their ability to inhibit cytopathic effects on Vero E6 cells by GX_P2X 
      infection. The antiviral activities and antiviral mechanisms of potential drugs were 
      further investigated. Viral yields of RNAs and infectious particles were quantified 
      by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and plaque assay, 
      respectively. RESULTS: The spike protein of coronavirus GX_P2V shares 92.2% amino 
      acid identity with that of 2019-nCoV isolate Wuhan-hu-1, and uses ACE2 as the 
      receptor for infection just like 2019-nCoV. Three drugs-cepharanthine (CEP), 
      selamectin and mefloquine hydrochloride exhibited complete inhibition of cytopathic 
      effects in cell culture at 10 μmol/L. CEP demonstrated the most potent inhibition of 
      GX_P2V infection, with a concentration for 50% of maximal effect [EC50] of 0.98 
      μmol/L. The viral RNA yield in cells treated with 10 μmol/L CEP was 15,393-fold 
      lower than in cells without CEP treatment ([6.48 ± 0.02] × 10vs. 1.00 ± 0.12, 
      t = 150.38, P < 0.001) at 72 h post-infection (p.i.). Plaque assays found no 
      production of live viruses in media containing 10 μmol/L CEP at 48 h p.i. 
      Furthermore, we found CEP has potent antiviral activities against both viral entry 
      (1.00 ± 0.37 vs. 0.46 ± 0.12, t = 2.42, P < 0.05) and viral replication (1.00 ± 0.43 
      vs. [6.18 ± 0.95] × 10, t = 3.98, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our pangolin coronavirus 
      GX_P2V is a workable model for 2019-nCoV research. CEP, selamectin and mefloquine 
      hydrochloride are potential drugs for treating 2019-nCoV infection. Our results 
      strongly suggest that CEP is a wide-spectrum inhibitor of pan-betacoronavirus, and 
      clinical trial of CEP for treatment of 2019-nCoV infection is warranted.

AB  - In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP, officially named 
      Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19) by the World Health Organization) broke out in 
      Wuhan, Hubei, and it quickly spread to the whole country and abroad. The situation 
      was at stake. The sudden and serious COVID-19 epidemic has brought us a lot of 
      urgent problems. How to effectively control the spread of COVID-19? When does the 
      population infection rate rise to its peak? What will eventually be the number of 
      infected patients? How to make early diagnosis? What effective antiviral drugs are 
      available? How to effectively treat with existing drugs? Can it successfully improve 
      the survival rate of critically patients? In response to the above questions, we put 
      forward corresponding suggestions and reflections from the perspective of the 
      infectious clinician.

AB  - In December 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia emerged in Wuhan City in central 
      China's Hubei Province. Genetic sequencing of isolates obtained from patients with 
      pneumonia identified a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as the etiology (1). As of 
      February 4, 2020, approximately 20,000 confirmed cases had been identified in China 
      and an additional 159 confirmed cases in 23 other countries, including 11 in the 
      United States (2,3). On January 17, CDC and the U.S. Department of Homeland 
      Security's Customs and Border Protection began health screenings at U.S. airports to 
      identify ill travelers returning from Wuhan City (4). CDC activated its Emergency 
      Operations Center on January 21 and formalized a process for inquiries regarding 
      persons suspected of having 2019-nCoV infection (2). As of January 31, 2020, CDC had 
      responded to clinical inquiries from public health officials and health care 
      providers to assist in evaluating approximately 650 persons thought to be at risk 
      for 2019-nCoV infection. Guided by CDC criteria for the evaluation of persons under 
      investigation (PUIs) (5), 210 symptomatic persons were tested for 2019-nCoV; among 
      these persons, 148 (70%) had travel-related risk only, 42 (20%) had close contact 
      with an ill laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV patient or PUI, and 18 (9%) had both 
      travel- and contact-related risks. Eleven of these persons had laboratory-confirmed 
      2019-nCoV infection. Recognizing persons at risk for 2019-nCoV is critical to 
      identifying cases and preventing further transmission. Health care providers should 
      remain vigilant and adhere to recommended infection prevention and control practices 
      when evaluating patients for possible 2019-nCoV infection (6). Providers should 
      consult with their local and state health departments when assessing not only ill 
      travelers from 2019-nCoV-affected countries but also ill persons who have been in 
      close contact with patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection in the 
      United States.

      Hubei, and spread rapidly to the nationwide. On January 20, 2020, the National 
      Health Committee classified COVID-19 pneumonia as one of B class infectious diseases 
      and treated it as class A infectious disease. During the epidemic period, the 
      routine diagnosis and treatment of tumor patients was affected with varying degrees. 
      In this special period, we performed the superiority of the multi-disciplinary team 
      of diagnosis and treatment, achieved accurate diagnosis and treatment of patients 
      with hepatobiliary malignant tumors, provided support for these patients with 
      limited medical resources, and helped them to survive during the epidemic period.On 
      the basis of fully understanding the new coronavirus pneumonia, the treatment 
      strategy should be changed timely during the epidemic, and more appropriate 
      treatment methods should be adopted to minimize the adverse effect of the epidemic 
      on tumor treatment.

AB  - Objective: To explorethe proper protective measures for pancreaticdiseases treatment 
      during theoutbreak of 2019 coronavirus disease(COVID-19). Method: Clinical data of 
      four cases of patients that suffered COVID-19from February 2(nd), 2020 to February 
      9(th), 2020 in pancreatic surgery were reviewed.After the first 
      patientscuffednosocomial infection of COVID-19, the general protective measures in 
      our department wereupdated.Only one patient was admitted to each room alone, with no 
      more than one caregiver.The body temperature of care givers was measuredtwice a 
      day.Primary protections were applied to all staff.The floor was sterilized using 
      disinfectant with an effective chlorine concentration of 1000 mg/L.The protective 
      measures for interventional procedures were as follow.Primary protection was applied 
      to the operators ofcentral venipuncture catheter, percutaneous abdominal/pleural 
      drainage, percutaneous retroperitoneal drainage, percutaneous transhepatic 
      cholangial drainage and other surgical procedures with local anesthesiaand epidural 
      anesthesia.Secondary protection was applied to the operators of endoscopic 
      retrograde cholangiopancreatography and surgical procedures with general anesthesia. 
      Results: During Feb 2(nd), 2020 to Feb 9(th), 2020, four patients in our department 
      were diagnosed with COVID-19, of which one was died of COVID-19, two were cured, and 
      one is still in hospital for COVID-19.After the update ofprotective measures in our 
      department, no more nosocomial infection of COVID-19occurred.Two central 
      venipuncture catheter, three percutaneous abdominal/pleural drainage, one 
      percutaneous retroperitoneal drainage, one percuteneous transhepatic cholecyst 
      drainage and one open surgery with general anesthesia were performed with no 
      infection of operators. Conclusions: The caregivers of patients are potential 
      infection source of COVID-19.Enhanced protective measures including the management 
      measures of caregivers can decrease the risk of nosocomial infection of COVID-19.

TI  - Molecular Mechanism for Antibody-Dependent Enhancement of Coronavirus Entry.
LID - 10.1128/JVI.02015-19 [doi]
LID - e02015-19
AB  - Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral entry has been a major concern for 
      epidemiology, vaccine development, and antibody-based drug therapy. However, the 
      molecular mechanism behind ADE is still elusive. Coronavirus spike protein mediates 
      viral entry into cells by first binding to a receptor on the host cell surface and 
      then fusing viral and host membranes. In this study, we investigated how a 
      neutralizing monoclonal antibody (MAb), which targets the receptor-binding domain 
      (RBD) of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus spike, mediates viral 
      entry using pseudovirus entry and biochemical assays. Our results showed that MAb 
      binds to the virus surface spike, allowing it to undergo conformational changes and 
      become prone to proteolytic activation. Meanwhile, MAb binds to cell surface IgG Fc 
      receptor, guiding viral entry through canonical viral-receptor-dependent pathways. 
      Our data suggest that the antibody/Fc-receptor complex functionally mimics viral 
      receptor in mediating viral entry. Moreover, we characterized MAb dosages in 
      viral-receptor-dependent, Fc-receptor-dependent, and both-receptors-dependent viral 
      entry pathways, delineating guidelines on MAb usages in treating viral infections. 
      Our study reveals a novel molecular mechanism for antibody-enhanced viral entry and 
      can guide future vaccination and antiviral strategies.IMPORTANCE Antibody-dependent 
      enhancement (ADE) of viral entry has been observed for many viruses. It was shown 
      that antibodies target one serotype of viruses but only subneutralize another, 
      leading to ADE of the latter viruses. Here we identify a novel mechanism for ADE: a 
      neutralizing antibody binds to the surface spike protein of coronaviruses like a 
      viral receptor, triggers a conformational change of the spike, and mediates viral 
      entry into IgG Fc receptor-expressing cells through canonical 
      viral-receptor-dependent pathways. We further evaluated how antibody dosages 
      impacted viral entry into cells expressing viral receptor, Fc receptor, or both 
      receptors. This study reveals complex roles of antibodies in viral entry and can 
      guide future vaccine design and antibody-based drug therapy.

TI  - [Expert consensus on preventing nosocomial transmission during respiratory care for 
      critically ill patients infected by 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia].
PG  - E020
LID - 10.3760/cma.j.issn.1001-0939.2020.0020 [doi]
AB  - Definite evidence has shown that the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) could be 
      transmitted from person to person, so far more than 1,700 bedside clinicians have 
      been infected. A lot of respiratory treatments for critically ill patients are 
      deemed as high-risk factors for nosocomial transmission, such as intubation, manual 
      ventilation by resuscitator, noninvasive ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula, 
      bronchoscopy examination, suction and patient transportation, etc, due to its high 
      possibility to cause or worsen the spread of the virus. As such, we developed this 
      consensus recommendations on all those high-risk treatments, based on the current 
      evidence as well as the resource limitation in some areas, with the aim to reduce 
      the nosocomial transmission and optimize the treatment for the COVID-19 pneumonia 
      patients. Those recommendations include: (1) Standard prevention and protection, and 
      patient isolation; (2) Patient wearing mask during HFNC treatment; (3) Using dual 
      limb ventilator with filters placed at the ventilator outlets, or using 
      heat-moisture exchanger (HME) instead of heated humidification in single limb 
      ventilator with HME placed between exhalation port and mask; avoid using mask with 
      exhalation port on the mask; (4) Placing filter between resuscitator and mask or 
      artificial airway; (5) For spontaneous breathing patients, placing mask for patients 
      during bronchoscopy examination; for patients receiving noninvasive ventilation, 
      using the special mask with bronchoscopy port to perform bronchoscopy; (6) Using 
      sedation and paralytics during intubation, cuff pressure should be maintained 
      between 25-30 cmH(2)O; (7) In-line suction catheter is recommended and it can be 
      used for one week; (8) Dual-limb heated wire circuits are recommended and only 
      changed with visible soiled; (9. For patients who need breathing support during 
      transportation, placing an HME between ventilator and patient; (10) PSV is 
      recommended for implementing spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), avoid using T-piece 
      to do SBT. When tracheotomy patients are weaned from ventilator, HME should be used, 
      avoid using T-piece or tracheostomy mask. (11) Avoid unnecessary bronchial hygiene 
      therapy; (12) For patients who need aerosol therapy, dry powder inhaler metered dose 
      inhaler with spacer is recommended for spontaneous breathing patients; while 
      vibrating mesh nebulizer is recommended for ventilated patients and additional 
      filter is recommended to be placed at the expiratory port of ventilation during 
      nebulization.

LID - 10.1002/jmv.25735 [doi]
AB  - We aim to summarize reliable evidence of evidence-based medicine for the treatment 
      and prevention of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by analyzing all the 
      published studies on the clinical characteristics of patients with 2019-nCoV. 
      PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and other databases were searched. Several studies 
      on the clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection were collected for 
      meta-analysis. Ten studies were included in the meta-analysis, including a total 
      number of 50 466 patients with 2019-nCoV infection. Meta-analysis shows that among 
      these patients, the incidence of fever was 89.1%, the incidence of cough was 72.2%, 
      and the incidence of muscle soreness or fatigue was 42.5%. The incidence of acute 
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was 14.8%, the incidence of abnormal chest 
      computer tomography (CT) was 96.6%, the percentage of severe cases in all infected 
      cases was 18.1%, and the case fatality rate of patients with 2019-nCoV infection was 
      4.3%. Fever and cough are the most common symptoms in patients with 2019-nCoV 
      infection, and most of these patients have abnormal chest CT examination. Several 
      people have muscle soreness or fatigue as well as ARDS. Diarrhea, hemoptysis, 
      headache, sore throat, shock, and other symptoms only occur in a small number of 
      patients. The case fatality rate of patients with 2019-nCoV infection is lower than 
      that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome.

TI  - Understanding SARS-CoV-2-Mediated Inflammatory Responses: From Mechanisms to 
      Potential Therapeutic Tools.
LID - 10.1007/s12250-020-00207-4 [doi]
AB  - Currently there is no effective antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection, which 
      frequently leads to fatal inflammatory responses and acute lung injury. Here, we 
      discuss the various mechanisms of SARS-CoV-mediated inflammation. We also assume 
      that SARS-CoV-2 likely shares similar inflammatory responses. Potential therapeutic 
      tools to reduce SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammatory responses include various methods to 
      block FcR activation. In the absence of a proven clinical FcR blocker, the use of 
      intravenous immunoglobulin to block FcR activation may be a viable option for the 
      urgent treatment of pulmonary inflammation to prevent severe lung injury. Such 
      treatment may also be combined with systemic anti-inflammatory drugs or 
      corticosteroids. However, these strategies, as proposed here, remain to be 
      clinically tested for effectiveness.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies on the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have generally 
      been limited to the description of the epidemiology and initial clinical 
      characteristics. We investigated the temporal progression in patients with COVID-19. 
      METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center study, we included confirmed cases of 
      COVID-19 from Jan 20 to Feb 6, 2020 in Shanghai. Final date of follow-up was 
      February 25, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 249 patients enrolled, the median age was 51 
      years old, and 126 (50.6%) were male. The duration from onset of symptoms to 
      hospitalization was 4(2-7) days in symptomatic patients. Fever was occurred in 
      235(94.3%) patients. A total of 215 (86.3%) patients had been discharged after 
      16(12-20) days hospitalization. The estimated median duration of fever in all the 
      patients with fever was 10 days (95 confidential intervals [CIs]: 8-11 days) after 
      onset of symptoms. Patients who were transferred to intensive care units (ICU) had 
      significantly longer duration of fever as compared to those not in ICU (31 days v.s. 
      9 days after onset of symptoms, respectively, P<0.0001). Radiological aggravation of 
      initial image was observed in 163 (65.7%) patients on day 7 after onset of symptoms. 
      154(94.5%) of these patients showed radiological improvement on day 14. The median 
      duration to negative reverse-transcriptase PCR tests of upper respiratory tract 
      samples was 11 days (95 CIs: 10-12 days). Viral clearance was more likely to be 
      delayed in patients in ICU than those not in ICU (P<0.0001). In multivariate 
      logistical analysis, age (Odds ratio [OR]=1.06) and CD4 T cell count (OR=0.55 per 
      100 cells/ul increase) were independently associated with ICU admission. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The majority of COVID-19 cases are mild. The clinical progression 
      pattern suggests that early control of viral replication and application of 
      host-directed therapy in later stage is essential to improve the prognosis of 
      CVOID-19.

AB  - The epidemiological history and clinical characteristics of 7 cases of COVID-19 and 
      1 case of close contact in the first family aggregation epidemic of COVID-19 in 
      Gansu Province were analyzed. The first patient A developed on January 22, 2020, 
      with a history of residence in Wuhan, and confirmed severe cases of NCP on January 
      24, 2020; patient B, on January 23, 2020, diagnosed on January 31, severe cases; 
      patient C, asymptomatic, diagnosed on January 27; patient D, asymptomatic, diagnosed 
      on January 27; patient E, on January 24, diagnosed on January 28; patient F, 
      asymptomatic, diagnosed on January 31; Patient G was asymptomatic and was diagnosed 
      on January 31. In close contact, H was asymptomatic, PCR test was negative and 
      asymptomatic, and he was discharged early. Among the 7 patients, 1 case died of (B) 
      aggravation, and the other patients' condition was effectively controlled after 
      active treatment. Except for the discharged cases, 5 cases were positive for 
      COVID-19 specific IgM antibody and 1 case was negative. In this clustering outbreak, 
      4 patients remained asymptomatic, but PCR and IgM antibodies were positive, 
      indicating that asymptomatic patients may be the key point to control the epidemic. 
      Specific IgM antibody screening for patients whose pharyngeal swab nucleic acid test 
      is negative but with ground glass-like lung lesions is very important for early 
      detection and early isolation.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of different anesthetic regimens for parturients with COVID-19 
      undergoing Cesarean delivery: a case series of 17 patients.
LID - 10.1007/s12630-020-01630-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the management and safety of epidural or general anesthesia for 
      Cesarean delivery in parturients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and their 
      newborns, and to evaluate the standardized procedures for protecting medical staff. 
      METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the cases of parturients diagnosed with severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection disease (COVID-19). 
      Their epidemiologic history, chest computed tomography scans, laboratory 
      measurements, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positivity were evaluated. We also 
      recorded the patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, anesthesia and 
      surgery-related data, maternal and neonatal complications, as well as the health 
      status of the involved medical staff. RESULTS: The clinical characteristics of 17 
      pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were similar to those previously reported in 
      non-pregnant adult patients. All of the 17 patients underwent Cesarean delivery with 
      anesthesia performed according to standardized anesthesia/surgery procedures. 
      Fourteen of the patients underwent continuous epidural anesthesia with 12 
      experiencing significant intraoperative hypotension. Three patients received general 
      anesthesia with tracheal intubation because emergency surgery was needed. Three of 
      the parturients are still recovering from their Cesarean delivery and are receiving 
      in-hospital treatment for COVID-19. Three neonates were born prematurely. There were 
      no deaths or serious neonatal asphyxia events. All neonatal SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid 
      tests were negative. No medical staff were infected throughout the patient care 
      period. CONCLUSIONS: Both epidural and general anesthesia were safely used for 
      Cesarean delivery in the parturients with COVID-19. Nevertheless, the incidence of 
      hypotension during epidural anesthesia appeared excessive. Proper patient transfer, 
      medical staff access procedures, and effective biosafety precautions are important 
      to protect medical staff from COVID-19.

AB  - At the end of December 2019, a novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, caused an outbreak of 
      pneumonia spreading from Wuhan, Hubei province, to the whole country of China, which 
      has posed great threats to public health and attracted enormous attention around the 
      world. To date, there are no clinically approved vaccines or antiviral drugs 
      available for these human coronavirus infections. Intensive research on the novel 
      emerging human infectious coronaviruses is urgently needed to elucidate their route 
      of transmission and pathogenic mechanisms, and to identify potential drug targets, 
      which would promote the development of effective preventive and therapeutic 
      countermeasures. Herein, we describe the epidemic and etiological characteristics of 
      2019-nCoV, discuss its essential biological features, including tropism and receptor 
      usage, summarize approaches for disease prevention and treatment, and speculate on 
      the transmission route of 2019-nCoV.

AB  - The continued emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) cases with a high 
      case fatality rate stresses the need for the availability of effective antiviral 
      treatments. Remdesivir (GS-5734) effectively inhibited MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) 
      replication in vitro, and showed efficacy against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 
      (SARS)-CoV in a mouse model. Here, we tested the efficacy of prophylactic and 
      therapeutic remdesivir treatment in a nonhuman primate model of MERS-CoV infection, 
      the rhesus macaque. Prophylactic remdesivir treatment initiated 24 h prior to 
      inoculation completely prevented MERS-CoV-induced clinical disease, strongly 
      inhibited MERS-CoV replication in respiratory tissues, and prevented the formation 
      of lung lesions. Therapeutic remdesivir treatment initiated 12 h postinoculation 
      also provided a clear clinical benefit, with a reduction in clinical signs, reduced 
      virus replication in the lungs, and decreased presence and severity of lung lesions. 
      The data presented here support testing of the efficacy of remdesivir treatment in 
      the context of a MERS clinical trial. It may also be considered for a wider range of 
      coronaviruses, including the currently emerging novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV.

TI  - Effectiveness of glucocorticoid therapy in patients with severe novel coronavirus 
      pneumonia: protocol of a randomized controlled trial.
LID - 10.1097/CM9.0000000000000791 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus outbreak emerged in Wuhan, 
      China, and its causative organism has been subsequently designated the 2019 novel 
      coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The virus has since rapidly spread to all provinces and 
      autonomous regions of China, and to countries outside of China. Patients who become 
      infected with 2019-nCoV may initially develop mild upper respiratory tract symptoms. 
      However, a significant fraction of these patients goes on to subsequently develop 
      serious lower respiratory disease. The effectiveness of adjunctive glucocorticoid 
      therapy uses in the management of 2019-nCoV infected patients with severe lower 
      respiratory tract infections is not clear, and warrants further investigation. 
      METHODS: The present study will be conducted as an open-labelled, randomised 
      controlled trial. We will enrol 48 subjects from Chongqing Public Health Medical 
      Center. Each eligible subject will be assigned to an intervention group 
      (methylprednisolone via intravenous injection at a dose of 1-2mg/kg/day for 3 days) 
      or a control group (no glucocorticoid use) randomly, at a 1:1 ratio. Subjects in 
      both groups will be invited for 28 days of follow-up which will be scheduled at 4 
      consecutive visit points. We will use the clinical improvement rate as our primary 
      endpoint. Secondary endpoints include the timing of clinical improvement after 
      intervention, duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of hospitalization, 
      overall incidence of adverse events, as well as rate of adverse events at each 
      visit, and mortality at 2 and 4 weeks. DISCUSSION: The present coronavirus outbreak 
      is the third serious global coronavirus outbreak in the past two decades. Oral and 
      parenteral glucocorticoids have been used in the management of severe respiratory 
      symptoms in coronavirus-infected patients in the past. However, there remains no 
      definitive evidence in the literature for or against the utilization of systemic 
      glucocorticoids in seriously ill patients with coronavirus-related severe 
      respiratory disease, or indeed in other types of severe respiratory disease. In this 
      study, we hope to discover evidence either supporting or opposing the systemic 
      therapeutic administration of glucocorticoids in severe coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19) patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, ChiCTR2000029386,

LID - 10.1007/s12250-020-00206-5 [doi]
AB  - Based on the announcement of the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2018, the Wuhan 
      pneumonia caused by an unknown etiology should be recognized as the first Disease X. 
      Later, the pathogen was identified to be a novel coronavirus denoted 2019-nCoV, 
      which has 79.5% and 96% whole genome sequence identify to SARS-CoV and bat 
      SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV-RaTG13), respectively, suggesting its potential 
      bat origin. With high human-to-human transmission rate (R0), 2019-nCoV has quickly 
      spread in China and other countries, resulting in 34,953 confirmed cases and 725 
      deaths as of 8 February 2020, thus calling for urgent development of therapeutics 
      and prophylactics. Here we suggest renaming 2019-nCoV as "transmissible acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus (TARS-CoV)" and briefly review the advancement of 
      research and development of neutralizing antibodies and vaccines targeting the 
      receptor-binding domain (RBD) and viral fusion inhibitors targeting the heptad 
      repeat 1 (HR1) domain in spike protein of 2019-nCoV.

TI  - Clinical features of pediatric patients with COVID-19: a report of two family 
      cluster cases.
LID - 10.1007/s12519-020-00356-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly across the globe. 
      People of all ages are susceptible to COVID-19. However, literature reports on 
      pediatric patients are limited. METHODS: To improve the recognition of COVID-19 
      infection in children, we retrospectively reviewed two confirmed pediatric cases 
      from two family clusters. Both clinical features and laboratory examination results 
      of the children and their family members were described. RESULTS: The two confirmed 
      children only presented with mild respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. Both of 
      them had normal chest CT images. After general and symptomatic treatments, both 
      children recovered quickly. Both families had travel histories to Hubei Province. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with COVID-19 are mostly owing to family cluster or 
      with a close contact history. Infected children have relatively milder clinical 
      symptoms than infected adults. We should attach importance to early recognition, 
      early diagnosis, and early treatment of infected children.

AB  - With the current trajectory of the 2019-nCoV outbreak unknown, public health and 
      medicinal measures will both be needed to contain spreading of the virus and to 
      optimize patient outcomes. Although little is known about the virus, an examination 
      of the genome sequence shows strong homology with its better-studied cousin, 
      SARS-CoV. The spike protein used for host cell infection shows key nonsynonymous 
      mutations that might hamper the efficacy of previously developed therapeutics but 
      remains a viable target for the development of biologics and macrocyclic peptides. 
      Other key drug targets, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and coronavirus main 
      proteinase (3CLpro), share a strikingly high (>95 %) homology to SARS-CoV. Herein, 
      we suggest four potential drug candidates (an ACE2-based peptide, remdesivir, 
      3CLpro-1 and a novel vinylsulfone protease inhibitor) that could be used to treat 
      patients suffering with the 2019-nCoV. We also summarize previous efforts into 
      drugging these targets and hope to help in the development of broad-spectrum 
      anti-coronaviral agents for future epidemics.

AB  - At the end of December 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) caused an outbreak in 
      Wuhan, and has quickly spread to all provinces in China and 26 other countries 
      around the world, leading to a serious situation for epidemic prevention. So far, 
      there is still no specific medicine. Previous studies have shown that chloroquine 
      phosphate (chloroquine) had a wide range of antiviral effects, including 
      anti-coronavirus. Here we found that treating the patients diagnosed as novel 
      coronavirus pneumonia with chloroquine might improve the success rate of treatment, 
      shorten hospital stay and improve patient outcome. In order to guide and regulate 
      the use of chloroquine in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia, the multicenter 
      collaboration group of Department of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province 
      and Health Commission of Guangdong Province for chloroquine in the treatment of 
      novel coronavirus pneumonia developed this expert consensus after extensive 
      discussion. It recommended chloroquine phosphate tablet, 500mg twice per day for 10 
      days for patients diagnosed as mild, moderate and severe cases of novel coronavirus 
      pneumonia and without contraindications to chloroquine.

      originating in Wuhan, China.
LID - 72
AB  - A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originating in Wuhan, China presents a potential 
      respiratory viral pandemic to the world population. Current efforts are focused on 
      containment and quarantine of infected individuals. Ultimately, the outbreak could 
      be controlled with a protective vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV infection. While 
      vaccine research should be pursued intensely, there exists today no therapy to treat 
      2019-nCoV upon infection, despite an urgent need to find options to help these 
      patients and preclude potential death. Herein, I review the potential options to 
      treat 2019-nCoV in patients, with an emphasis on the necessity for speed and 
      timeliness in developing new and effective therapies in this outbreak. I consider 
      the options of drug repurposing, developing neutralizing monoclonal antibody 
      therapy, and an oligonucleotide strategy targeting the viral RNA genome, emphasizing 
      the promise and pitfalls of these approaches. Finally, I advocate for the fastest 
      strategy to develop a treatment now, which could be resistant to any mutations the 
      virus may have in the future. The proposal is a biologic that blocks 2019-nCoV entry 
      using a soluble version of the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 
      (ACE2), fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain (ACE2-Fc), providing a neutralizing 
      antibody with maximal breath to avoid any viral escape, while also helping to 
      recruit the immune system to build lasting immunity. The ACE2-Fc therapy would also 
      supplement decreased ACE2 levels in the lungs during infection, thereby directly 
      treating acute respiratory distress pathophysiology as a third mechanism of action. 
      The sequence of the ACE2-Fc protein is provided to investigators, allowing its 
      possible use in recombinant protein expression systems to start producing drug today 
      to treat patients under compassionate use, while formal clinical trials are later 
      undertaken. Such a treatment could help infected patients before a protective 
      vaccine is developed and widely available in the coming months to year(s).

      strategy to develop a treatment now, which could be resistant to any mutations the 
      virus may have in the future. The proposal is a biologic that blocks 2019-nCoV entry 
      using a soluble version of the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 
      (ACE2), fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain, providing a neutralizing antibody with 
      maximal breath to avoid any viral escape, while also helping to recruit the immune 
      system to build lasting immunity. The sequence of the ACE2-Fc protein is provided to 
      investigators, allowing its possible use in recombinant protein expression systems 
      to start producing drug today to treat patients under compassionate use, while 
      formal clinical trials are later undertaken. Such a treatment could help infected 
      patients before a protective vaccine is developed and widely available in the coming 
      months to year(s).

AB  - The recent outbreak of pneumonia-causing COVID-19 in China is an urgent global 
      public health issue with an increase in mortality and morbidity. Here we report our 
      modelled homo-trimer structure of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein in both closed 
      (ligand-free) and open (ligand-bound) conformation, which is involved in host cell 
      adhesion. We also predict the unique N- and O-linked glycosylation sites of spike 
      glycoprotein that distinguish it from the SARS and underlines shielding and 
      camouflage of COVID-19 from the host the defence system. Furthermore, our study also 
      highlights the key finding that the S1 domain of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein 
      potentially interacts with the human CD26, a key immunoregulatory factor for 
      hijacking and virulence. These findings accentuate the unique features of COVID-19 
      and assist in the development of new therapeutics.

AB  - The outbreak of the 2019-nCoV infection began in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei 
      province, and rapidly spread to many provinces in China as well as other countries. 
      Here we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological 
      characteristics, as well as potential biomarkers for predicting disease severity in 
      2019-nCoV-infected patients in Shenzhen, China. All 12 cases of the 
      2019-nCoV-infected patients developed pneumonia and half of them developed acute 
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The most common laboratory abnormalities were 
      hypoalbuminemia, lymphopenia, decreased percentage of lymphocytes (LYM) and 
      neutrophils (NEU), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase 
      (LDH), and decreased CD8 count. The viral load of 2019-nCoV detected from patient 
      respiratory tracts was positively linked to lung disease severity. ALB, LYM, LYM 
      (%), LDH, NEU (%), and CRP were highly correlated to the acute lung injury. Age, 
      viral load, lung injury score, and blood biochemistry indexes, albumin (ALB), CRP, 
      LDH, LYM (%), LYM, and NEU (%), may be predictors of disease severity. Moreover, the 
      Angiotensin II level in the plasma sample from 2019-nCoV infected patients was 
      markedly elevated and linearly associated to viral load and lung injury. Our results 
      suggest a number of potential diagnosis biomarkers and angiotensin receptor blocker 
      (ARB) drugs for potential repurposing treatment of 2019-nCoV infection.

AB  - After the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the world in 
      2003, human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been reported as pathogens that cause severe 
      symptoms in respiratory tract infections. Recently, a new emerged HCoV isolated from 
      the respiratory epithelium of unexplained pneumonia patients in the Wuhan seafood 
      market caused a major disease outbreak and has been named the severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus causes acute lung 
      symptoms, leading to a condition that has been named as "coronavirus disease 2019" 
      (COVID-19). The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and of SARS-CoV caused widespread fear and 
      concern and has threatened global health security. There are some similarities and 
      differences in the epidemiology and clinical features between these two viruses and 
      diseases that are caused by these viruses. The goal of this work is to 
      systematically review and compare between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in the context of 
      their virus incubation, originations, diagnosis and treatment methods, genomic and 
      proteomic sequences, and pathogenic mechanisms.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Following the public health emergency declared by the World Health 
      Organization and the recent outbreak by 2019-nCoV in China and through other 29 
      countries, we aimed to summarize the clinical aspects of novel beta-coronavirus 
      infection and its possible clinical presentations together with suggested 
      therapeutic algorithms for patients who may require antibiotic treatment. METHODS: 
      We reviewed the currently available literature of microbiologically confirmed 
      infections by 2019-ConV (or COVID-19) occurred at the time of writing (13 February 
      2020). A literature search was performed using the PubMed database and the Cochrane 
      library. Search terms included "novel coronavirus" or "2019-nCoV" or "COVID-19". 
      RESULTS: Published cases occurred mostly in males (age ranged from 8 to 92). 
      Cardiovascular, digestive and endocrine system diseases were commonly reported, 
      except previous chronic pulmonary diseases (e.g., COPD, asthma, bronchiectasis) that 
      were surprisingly underreported. Fever was presented in all the case series 
      available, flanked by cough, dyspnea, myalgias and fatigue. Multiple bilateral 
      lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation or bilateral ground-glass opacities 
      were the main reported radiological features of 2019-nCoV, at least in the early 
      phases of disease. CONCLUSIONS: The new 2019-nCoV epidemics is mainly associated 
      with respiratory disease and few extrapulmonary signs. However, there is a low rate 
      of associated pre-existing respiratory comorbidities.

AB  - At the end of 2019, sporadic and clustered case with "pneumonia of unknown origin" 
      emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province. The causative pathogen was quickly confirmed as 
      "2019-nCoV" . The epidemic soon spread throughout the country and became a pandemic 
      in over a month. Government and medical institutions across the country mobilized 
      all kinds of resources and took a variety of measures to actively treat patients and 
      stop the epidemic. Based on current studies, the author summarized the clinical 
      characteristics and evolution of the novel viral pneumonia, and proposed the key 
      points of diagnosis and treatment, the scientific management of both confirmed and 
      suspected cases, and the scientific management of disease prevention and control.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Understanding the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) mode of host cell 
      recognition may help to fight the disease and save lives. The spike protein of 
      coronaviruses is the main driving force for host cell recognition. METHODS: In this 
      study, the COVID-19 spike binding site to the cell-surface receptor (Glucose 
      Regulated Protein 78 (GRP78)) is predicted using combined molecular modeling docking 
      and structural bioinformatics. The COVID-19 spike protein is modeled using its 
      counterpart, the SARS spike. RESULTS: Sequence and structural alignments show that 
      four regions, in addition to its cyclic nature have sequence and physicochemical 
      similarities to the cyclic Pep42. Protein-protein docking was performed to test the 
      four regions of the spike that fit tightly in the GRP78 Substrate Binding Domain β 
      (SBDβ). The docking pose revealed the involvement of the SBDβ of GRP78 and the 
      receptor-binding domain of the coronavirus spike protein in recognition of the host 
      cell receptor. CONCLUSIONS: We reveal that the binding is more favorable between 
      regions III (C391-C525) and IV (C480-C488) of the spike protein model and GRP78. 
      Region IV is the main driving force for GRP78 binding with the predicted binding 
      affinity of -9.8 kcal/mol. These nine residues can be used to develop therapeutics 
      specific against COVID-19.

TI  - Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak: Now is the time to refresh pandemic 
      plans.
PG  - 1-15
AB  - This article outlines practical steps that businesses can take now to prepare for a 
      pandemic. Given the current growing spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
      around the world, it is imperative that businesses review their pandemic plans and 
      be prepared in case this epidemic expands and affects more people and communities. 
      Preparing for a potential infectious disease pandemic from influenza or a novel 
      corona virus is an essential component of a business continuity plan, especially for 
      businesses that provide critical healthcare and infrastructure services. Although 
      many businesses and organisations have a pandemic plan or address pandemic 
      preparedness in their business continuity plans, few have recently tested and 
      updated their plans. Pandemics can not only interrupt an organisation's operations 
      and compromise long-term viability of an enterprise, but also disrupt the provision 
      of critical functions. Businesses that regularly test and update their pandemic plan 
      can significantly reduce harmful impacts to the business, play a key role in 
      protecting employees' and customers' health and safety, and limit the negative 
      impact of a pandemic on the community and economy.

TI  - Successful recovery of COVID-19 pneumonia in a renal transplant recipient with 
      long-term immunosuppression.
LID - 10.1111/ajt.15869 [doi]
AB  - The current outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has raised great concern 
      worldwide, but its impact on transplant recipients is unknown. We report here the 
      clinical features and therapeutic course of the first reported renal transplant 
      recipient with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. This is a 52-year-old man who received 
      kidney transplantation 12 years ago. His overall clinical characteristics (symptoms, 
      laboratory examinations, and chest CT) were similar to those of non-transplanted 
      COVID-19 patients. Following a treatment regimen consisting of reduced 
      immunosuppressant use and low dose methylprednisolone-based therapy, the COVID-19 
      pneumonia in this long-term immunosuppressive patient was successfully recovered. 
      This effectively treated case has reference value for the future treatment of other 
      transplant patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

TI  - Overview of The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV): The Pathogen of Severe Specific 
      Contagious Pneumonia (SSCP).
LID - 10.1097/JCMA.0000000000000270 [doi]
AB  - In late December 2019 a previous unidentified coronavirus, currently named as the 
      2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), emerged from Wuhan, China and resulted in a 
      formidable outbreak in many cities in China and expanding globally, including 
      Thailand, Republic of Korea, Japan, USA, Philippines, Viet Nam, and our country (as 
      of 2/6/2020 at least 25 countries). The disease is officially named as the Severe 
      Specific Contagious Pneumonia (SSCP) in 1/15/2019 and is a notifiable communicable 
      disease of the 5 category by the Taiwan CDC, the Ministry of Health. SSCP is a 
      potential zoonotic disease with low to moderate (estimated 2-5%) mortality rate. 
      Person-to-person transmission may occur through droplet or contact transmission and 
      jeopardized first-line healthcare workers if lack of stringent infection control or 
      no proper personal protective equipment available. Currently, there is no definite 
      treatment for SSCP although some drugs are under investigation. To promptly identify 
      patients and prevent further spreading, physicians should be aware of travel or 
      contact history for patients with compatible symptoms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to the 2019 novel coronavirus 
      (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China. We aimed to 
      compare arbidol and lopinavir/ritonavir(LPV/r) treatment for patients with COVID-19 
      with LPV/r only. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we included adults 
      (age≥18years) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 without Invasive ventilation, 
      diagnosed between Jan 17, 2020, and Feb 13, 2020. Patients, diagnosed after Jan 17, 
      2020, were given oral arbidol and LPV/r in the combination group and oral LPV/r only 
      in the monotherapy group for 5-21 days. The primary endpoint was a negative 
      conversion rate of coronavirus from the date of COVID-19 diagnosis(day7, day14), and 
      assessed whether the pneumonia was progressing or improving by chest CT (day7). 
      RESULTS: We analyzed 16 patients who received oral arbidol and LPV/r in the 
      combination group and 17 who oral LPV/r only in the monotherapy group, and both 
      initiated after diagnosis. Baseline clinical, laboratory, and chest CT 
      characteristics were similar between groups. The SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected 
      for 12(75%) of 16 patients' nasopharyngeal specimens in the combination group after 
      seven days, compared with 6 (35%) of 17 in the monotherapy group (p<0•05). After 14 
      days, 15 (94%) of 16 and 9 (52•9%) of 17, respectively, SARS-CoV-2 could not be 
      detected (p<0•05). The chest CT scans were improving for 11(69%) of 16 patients in 
      the combination group after seven days, compared with 5(29%) of 17 in the 
      monotherapy group (p<0•05). CONCLUSION: In patients with COVID-19, the apparent 
      favorable clinical response with arbidol and LPV/r supports further LPV/r only.

AB  - Objective: To identify the characteristics including clinical features and pulmonary 
      computed tomography (CT) features of heart failure and novel coronavirus 
      pneumonia(COVID-19). Methods: This study was a retrospective study. A total of 7 
      patients with Heart failure and 12 patients with COVID-19 in the Second Xiangya 
      Hospital of Central South University between December 1, 2019 and February 15, 2020 
      were enrolled. The baseline clinical and imaging features of the two groups were 
      statistically analyzed. Results: There was no significant difference in age and sex 
      between the two groups, but the incidence of epidemiological contact history, fever 
      or respiratory symptoms in the COVID-19 group was significantly higher than that in 
      the heart failure group (12/12 vs. 2/7, P=0.001; 12/12 vs. 4/7, P<0.001). While the 
      proportion of cardiovascular diseases and impaired cardiac function was 
      significantly less than that of the heart failure group(2/12 vs.7/7, P<0.001; 0/12 
      vs.7/7, P<0.001). For imaging features, both groups had ground-glass opacity and 
      thickening of interlobular septum, but the ratio of central and gradient 
      distribution was higher in patients with heart failure than that in patients with 
      COVID-19 (4/7 vs. 1/12, P=0.04). In heart failure group, the ratio of the expansion 
      of small pulmonary veins was also higher (3/7 vs. 0, P=0.013), and the lung lesions 
      can be significantly improved after effective anti-heart failure treatment. Besides, 
      there are more disease with rounded morphology in COVID-19 (9/12 vs. 2/7, P=0.048) . 
      Conclusions: More patients with COVID-19 have epidemiological history and fever or 
      respiratory symptoms. There are significant differences in chest CT features, such 
      as enlargement of pulmonary veins, lesions distribution and morphology between heart 
      failure and COVID-19.

AB  - So far, there is a lack of effective drugs for the new coronavirus pneumonia. With 
      more and more patients diagnosed, China has carried out more than 100 clinical 
      studies of new coronavirus infection, including antiviral drugs, antimalarial drugs, 
      glucocorticoids, plasma therapy, virus vaccine, and other Western drugs, while 
      Chinese medicine research accounted for half of the studies. Most of the trials were 
      initiated by investigators and the study period would last for 1 to 11 months. The 
      primary endpoints included symptom improvement and virus nucleic acid turning 
      negative, but the optimal endpoint has not been determined. Although the final 
      results of studies will take a long time to complete, the interim research data may 
      provide some help for the current urgent demand for drug treatment. Compared with 
      that of during SARS period in 2003, China has the stronger capability to carry out 
      clinical trials of new drugs in emergency period.

AB  - The treatment of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) 
      faces compelling challenges. In this issue, we'd like to share our first-line 
      treatment experience in treating COVID-19. Hemodynamics need be closely monitored 
      and different types of shock should be distinguished. Vasoconstrictor drugs should 
      be used rationally and alerting of complications is of the same importance. The risk 
      of venous thromboembolism (VTE) needs to be assessed, and effective prevention 
      should be carried out for high-risk patients. It is necessary to consider the 
      possibility of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) in patients with sudden onset of 
      oxygenation deterioration, respiratory distress, reduced blood pressure. However, 
      comprehensive analysis of disease state should be taken into the interpretation of 
      abnormally elevated D-Dimer. Nutritional support is the basis of treatment. It's 
      important to establish individual therapy regimens and to evaluate, monitor and 
      adjust dynamically. Under the current epidemic situation, convalescent plasma can 
      only be used empirically, indications need to be strictly screened, the blood 
      transfusion process should be closely monitored and the curative effect should be 
      dynamically evaluated.

AB  - Objective: To explore the clinical characteristics and prognosis of the new 
      coronavirus 2019-nCoV patients combined with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Methods: 
      A retrospective analysis was performed on 112 COVID-19 patients with CVD admitted to 
      the western district of Union Hospital in Wuhan, from January 20, 2020 to February 
      15, 2020. They were divided into critical group (ICU, n=16) and general group (n=96) 
      according to the severity of the disease and patients were followed up to the 
      clinical endpoint. The observation indicators included total blood count, C-reactive 
      protein (CRP), arterial blood gas analysis, myocardial injury markers, coagulation 
      function, liver and kidney function, electrolyte, procalcitonin (PCT), B-type 
      natriuretic peptide (BNP), blood lipid, pulmonary CT and pathogen detection. 
      Results: Compared with the general group, the lymphocyte count (0.74×10(9) 
      (0.34×10(9), 0.94×10(9))/L vs. 0.99×10(9) (0.71×10(9), 1.29×10(9))/L, P=0.03) was 
      extremely lower in the critical group, CRP (106.98 (81.57, 135.76) mg/L vs. 34.34 
      (9.55,76.54) mg/L, P<0.001) and PCT (0.20 (0.15,0.48) μg/L vs. 0.11 (0.06,0.20)μg/L, 
      P<0.001) were significantly higher in the critical group. The BMI of the critical 
      group was significantly higher than that of the general group (25.5 (23.0, 27.5) 
      kg/m(2) vs. 22.0 (20.0, 24.0) kg/m(2), P=0.003). Patients were further divided into 
      non-survivor group (17, 15.18%) group and survivor group (95, 84.82%). Among the 
      non-survivors, there were 88.24% (15/17) patients with BMI> 25 kg/m(2), which was 
      significantly higher than that of survivors (18.95% (18/95), P<0.001). Compared with 
      the survived patients, oxygenation index (130 (102, 415) vs. 434 (410, 444), 
      P<0.001) was significantly lower and lactic acid (1.70 (1.30, 3.00) mmol/L vs. 1.20 
      (1.10, 1.60) mmol/L, P<0.001) was significantly higher in the non-survivors. There 
      was no significant difference in the proportion of ACEI/ARB medication between the 
      critical group and the general group or between non-survivors and survivors (all 
      P>0.05). Conclusion: COVID-19 patients combined with CVD are associated with a 
      higher risk of mortality. Critical patients are characterized with lower lymphocyte 
      counts. Higher BMI are more often seen in critical patients and non-survivor. 
      ACEI/ARB use does not affect the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 combined with 
      CVD. Aggravating causes of death include fulminant inflammation, lactic acid 
      accumulation and thrombotic events.

      attracting attention worldwidely. The novel coronavirus has the characteristics of 
      rapid transmission, atypical clinical symptoms, and easy to affect both lungs, 
      leading to missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis, as well as difficult to detection and 
      assessment at early stage. Fever, cough, myalgia, weakness, dyspnea and imagings may 
      be helpful for the early detection of novel coronavirus pneumonia. At the same time, 
      the rate of disease progression, fever, CT manifestations, hypoxia degree, age, 
      basic diseases, and laboratory indicators can also be used to evaluate the severity 
      of the novel coronavirus pneumonia.

AB  - Since the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (formerly known as the 
      2019 novel coronavirus [2019-nCoV]) in Wuhan, China in December 2019, which is 
      caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), more than 
      75,000 cases have been reported in 32 countries/regions, resulting in more than 2000 
      deaths worldwide. Despite the fact that most COVID-19 cases and mortalities were 
      reported in China, the WHO has declared this outbreak as the sixth public health 
      emergency of international concern. The COVID-19 can present as an asymptomatic 
      carrier state, acute respiratory disease, and pneumonia. Adults represent the 
      population with the highest infection rate; however, neonates, children, and elderly 
      patients can also be infected by SARS-CoV-2. In addition, nosocomial infection of 
      hospitalized patients and healthcare workers, and viral transmission from 
      asymptomatic carriers are possible. The most common finding on chest imaging among 
      patients with pneumonia was ground-glass opacity with bilateral involvement. Severe 
      cases are more likely to be older patients with underlying comorbidities compared to 
      mild cases. Indeed, age and disease severity may be correlated with the outcomes of 
      COVID-19. To date, effective treatment is lacking; however, clinical trials 
      investigating the efficacy of several agents, including remdesivir and chloroquine, 
      are underway in China. Currently, effective infection control intervention is the 
      only way to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to the general susceptibility of new coronaviruses, the clinical 
      characteristics and outcomes of elderly and young patients may be different. 
      OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical characteristics of elderly patients with new-type 
      coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19). METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients 
      with new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) who were hospitalized in Hainan Provincial 
      People's Hospital from January 15, 2020 to February 18, 2020. Compare the clinical 
      characteristics of elderly with Young and Middle-aged patients. RESULTS: A total of 
      56 patients were evaluated, 18 elderly patients (32.14%), and 38 young and 
      middle-aged patients (67.86%). The most common symptoms in both groups were fever, 
      followed by cough and sputum. Four patients in the elderly group received negative 
      pressure ICU for mechanical ventilation, and five patients in the young and 
      middle-aged group. One patient died in the elderly group (5.56%), and two patients 
      died in the young and middle-aged group (5.26%). The PSI score of the elderly group 
      was higher than that of the young and middle-aged group (P<0.001). The proportion of 
      patients with PSI grades IV and V was significantly higher in the elderly group than 
      in the young and middle-aged group (P<0.05). The proportion of multiple lobe 
      involvement in the elderly group was higher than that in the young and middle-aged 
      group (P<0.001), and there was no difference in single lobe lesions between the two 
      groups. The proportion of lymphocytes in the elderly group was significantly lower 
      than that in the young and middle-aged group (P<0.001), and the C-reactive protein 
      was significantly higher in the young group (P<0.001). The Lopinavir and Ritonavir 
      Tablets, Chinese medicine, oxygen therapy, and mechanical ventilation were 
      statistically different in the elderly group and the young and middle-aged group, 
      and the P values were all <0.05.

TI  - Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio is associated with prognosis in patients with Corona 
      Virus Disease-19.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25767 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: SinceDecember 2019, novelcoronavirus infected pneumonia emerged in 
      Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China. In severe novel coronavirus 
      pneumonia cases, the number of platelets, their dynamic changes during the 
      treatment, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio(PLR)were a concern. We sought to describe 
      platelet feature of these cases. METHODS: Single-center case series of the 30 
      hospitalized patients with confirmed Corona Virus Disease(COVID)-19 in Huizhou 
      municipal central hospitalfrom January 2020 to February 2020 were retrospectively 
      analysed. Demographic, clinical, blood routine results, other laborotary results and 
      treatment date were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of severe patients and 
      non-severe patients were compared. RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that: age, 
      platelet peaks and PLR at peak platelet were the influencing factors in severe 
      patients,multivariate analysis showed that the PLR value at peak platelet during 
      treatment was an independent influencing factor in severe patients.The average 
      hospitalization day of patients with platelet peaks during treatment were longer 
      than those without platelet peaks(P<0.05).The average age of patients with platelet 
      peaks during treatment were older than those without platelet peaks(P<0.05). The 
      patients with significantly elevated platelets during treatment had longer average 
      hospitalization day. And the higher PLR of patients during treatment had longer 
      average hospitalization day. CONCLUSION: Single-center case series of the 30 
      hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Huizhou municipal central hospital, 
      presumed that the number of platelets and their dynamic changes during the treatment 
      may have suggestion on the severity and prognosis of disease. The patient with 
      markedly elevated platelets and longer average hospitalization day may be related to 
      the cytokine storm. The PLR of patients means the degree of cytokine storm, which 
      might provide a new indicator in the monitoring in patients with COVID-19. This

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this study we execute a rational screen to identify Chinese medical 
      herbs that are commonly used in treating viral respiratory infections and also 
      contain compounds that might directly inhibit 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), an 
      ongoing novel coronavirus that causes pneumonia. METHODS: There were two main steps 
      in the screening process. In the first step we conducted a literature search for 
      natural compounds that had been biologically confirmed as against sever acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. 
      Resulting compounds were cross-checked for listing in the Traditional Chinese 
      Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database. Compounds meeting both requirements were 
      subjected to absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) evaluation to 
      verify that oral administration would be effective. Next, a docking analysis was 
      used to test whether the compound had the potential for direct 2019-nCoV protein 
      interaction. In the second step we searched Chinese herbal databases to identify 
      plants containing the selected compounds. Plants containing 2 or more of the 
      compounds identified in our screen were then checked against the catalogue for 
      classic herbal usage. Finally, network pharmacology analysis was used to predict the 
      general in vivo effects of each selected herb. RESULTS: Of the natural compounds 
      screened, 13 that exist in traditional Chinese medicines were also found to have 
      potential anti-2019-nCoV activity. Further, 125 Chinese herbs were found to contain 
      2 or more of these 13 compounds. Of these 125 herbs, 26 are classically catalogued 
      as treating viral respiratory infections. Network pharmacology analysis predicted 
      that the general in vivo roles of these 26 herbal plants were related to regulating 
      viral infection, immune/inflammation reactions and hypoxia response. CONCLUSION: 
      Chinese herbal treatments classically used for treating viral respiratory infection 
      might contain direct anti-2019-nCoV compounds.

AB  - On 10 January 2020, a new coronavirus causing a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan City in 
      central China was denoted as 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO). As of 
      24 January 2020, there were 887 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection, including 26 
      deaths, reported in China and other countries. Therefore, combating this new virus 
      and stopping the epidemic is a matter of urgency. Here, we focus on advances in 
      research and development of fast diagnosis methods, as well as potential 
      prophylactics and therapeutics to prevent or treat 2019-nCoV infection.

AB  - The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) highlights an urgent need 
      for therapeutics. Through a series of drug repurposing screening campaigns, 
      niclosamide, an FDA-approved anthelminthic drug, was found to be effective against 
      various viral infections with nanomolar to micromolar potency such as SARS-CoV, 
      MERS-CoV, ZIKV, HCV, and human adenovirus, indicating its potential as an antiviral 
      agent. In this brief review, we summarize the broad antiviral activity of 
      niclosamide and highlight its potential clinical use in the treatment of COVID-19.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the mental health of clinical first-line medical staff in 
      COVID-19 epidemic and provide theoretical basis for psychological intervention. 
      Method: The mental health status of the first-line medical staff was investigated by 
      Self-rating Anxiety Acale (SAS) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Self-rating 
      Scale(PTSD-SS). From February 7 to 14, 2020, 246 medical staff were investigated who 
      participated in the treatment of COVID-19 using cluster sampling , and received 230 
      responses, with a recovery rate of 93.5%. Results: The incidence of anxiety in 
      medical staff was 23.04% (53/230), and the score of SAS was (42.91 ± 10.89). Among 
      them, the incidence of severe anxiety, moderate anxiety and mild anxiety were 2.17% 
      (5/230), 4.78% (11/230) and 16.09% (37/230), respectively. The incidence of anxiety 
      in female medical staff was higher than that in male [25.67% (48/187) vs 11.63% 
      (5/43), Z=-2.008, P=0.045], the score of SAS in female medical staff was higher than 
      that in male [(43.78±11.12) vs (39.14 ± 9.01), t =-2.548, P=0.012]. The incidence of 
      anxiety in nurses was higher than that in doctors [26.88% (43/160) vs 14.29% 
      (10/70), Z=-2.066, P=0.039], and the score of SAS in nurses was higher than that in 
      doctors [(44.84±10.42) vs (38.50±10.72), t =-4.207, P<0.001]. The incidence of 
      stress disorder in medical staff was 27.39% (63/230), and the score of PTSD-SS was 
      (42.92 ± 17.88). The score of PTSD-SS in female medical staff was higher than that 
      of male [(44.30±18.42) vs(36.91 ± 13.95), t=-2.472, P=0.014]. Conclusions: In 
      COVID-19 epidemic, the incidence of anxiety and stress disorder is high among 
      medical staff. Medical institutions should strengthen the training of psychological 
      skills of medical staff. Special attention should be paid to the mental health of 
      female nurses.

AB  - An ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus infection in Wuhan, China since December 
      2019 has led to 31,516 infected persons and 638 deaths across 25 countries (till 
      16:00 on February 7, 2020). The virus causing this pneumonia was then named as the 
      2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization. To promote the 
      data sharing and make all relevant information of 2019-nCoV publicly available, we 
      construct the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource (2019nCoVR, 
      https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov). 2019nCoVR features comprehensive integration of 
      genomic and proteomic sequences as well as their metadata information from the 
      Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, National Center for Biotechnology 
      Information, China National GeneBank, National Microbiology Data Center and China 
      National Center for Bioinformation (CNCB)/National Genomics Data Center (NGDC). It 
      also incorporates a wide range of relevant information including scientific 
      literatures, news, and popular articles for science dissemination, and provides 
      visualization functionalities for genome variation analysis results based on all 
      collected 2019-nCoV strains. Moreover, by linking seamlessly with related databases 
      in CNCB/NGDC, 2019nCoVR offers virus data submission and sharing services for raw 
      sequence reads and assembled sequences. In this report, we provide comprehensive 
      descriptions on data deposition, management, release and utility in 2019nCoVR, 
      laying important foundations in aid of studies on virus classification and origin, 
      genome variation and evolution, fast detection, drug development and pneumonia 
      precision prevention and therapy.

AB  - There is a current worldwide outbreak of the novel coronavirus Covid-19 (coronavirus 
      disease 2019; the pathogen called SARS-CoV-2; previously 2019-nCoV), which 
      originated from Wuhan in China and has now spread to 6 continents including 66 
      countries, as of 24:00 on March 2, 2020. Governments are under increased pressure to 
      stop the outbreak spiraling into a global health emergency. At this stage, 
      preparedness, transparency, and sharing of information are crucial to risk 
      assessments and beginning outbreak control activities. This information should 
      include reports from outbreak site and from laboratories supporting the 
      investigation. This paper aggregates and consolidates the epidemiology, clinical 
      manifestations, diagnosis, treatments and preventions of this new type of 
      coronavirus.

AB  - Objective: To explore imaging characteristics of children with 2019 novel 
      coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed 
      on clinical data and chest CT images of 15 children diagnosed with 2019-nCoV. They 
      were admitted to the third people's Hospital of Shenzhen from January 16 to February 
      6, 2020. The distribution and morphology of pulmonary lesions on chest CT images 
      were analyzed. Results: Among the 15 children, there were 5 males and 10 females, 
      aged from 4 to 14 years old. Five of the 15 children were febrile and 10 were 
      asymptomatic on first visit. The first nasal or pharyngeal swab samples in all the 
      15 cases were positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid. For their first chest CT images, 
      6 patients had no lesions, while 9 patients had pulmonary inflammation lesions. 
      Seven cases of small nodular ground glass opacities and 2 cases of speckled ground 
      glass opacities were found. After 3 to 5 days of treatment, 2019-nCoV nucleic acid 
      in a second respiratory sample turned negative in 6 cases. Among them, chest CT 
      images showed less lesions in 2 cases, no lesion in 3 cases, and no improvement in 1 
      case. Other 9 cases were still positive in a second nucleic acid test. Six patients 
      showed similar chest CT inflammation, while 3 patients had new lesions, which were 
      all small nodular ground glass opacities. Conclusions: The early chest CT images of 
      children with 2019-nCoV infection are mostly small nodular ground glass opacities. 
      The clinical symptoms of children with 2019-nCoV infection are nonspecific. Dynamic 
      reexamination of chest CT and nucleic acid are important.

AB  - Previous studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus 
      disease (COVID-19) were mainly based on information from adult populations. Limited 
      data are available for children with COVID-19, especially for infected infants. We 
      report a 55-day-old case with COVID-19 confirmed in China and describe the 
      identification, diagnosis, clinical course, and treatment of the patient, including 
      the disease progression from day 7 to day 11 of illness. This case highlights that 
      children with COVID-19 can also present with multiple organ damage and rapid disease 
      changes. When managing such patients, frequent and careful clinical monitoring is 
      essential.

AB  - Recently, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), officially known as severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in China. Despite drastic 
      containment measures, the spread of this virus is ongoing. SARS-CoV-2 is the 
      aetiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) characterised by pulmonary 
      infection in humans. The efforts of international health authorities have since 
      focused on rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients as well as the search for 
      therapies able to counter the most severe effects of the disease. In the absence of 
      a known efficient therapy and because of the situation of a public-health emergency, 
      it made sense to investigate the possible effect of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine 
      against SARS-CoV-2 since this molecule was previously described as a potent 
      inhibitor of most coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1. Preliminary trials of 
      chloroquine repurposing in the treatment of COVID-19 in China have been encouraging, 
      leading to several new trials. Here we discuss the possible mechanisms of 
      chloroquine interference with the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle.

AB  - The human FcγRs interact with antigen-complexed IgG ligands to both activate and 
      modulate a powerful network of inflammatory host-protective effector functions that 
      are key to the normal physiology of immune resistance to pathogens. More than 100 
      therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are approved or in late stage clinical 
      trials, many of which harness the potent FcγR-mediated effector systems to varying 
      degrees. This is most evident for antibodies targeting cancer cells inducing 
      antibody-dependent killing or phagocytosis but is also true to some degree for the 
      mAbs that neutralise or remove small macromolecules such as cytokines or other 
      immunoglobulins. The use of mAb therapeutics has also revealed a "scaffolding" role 
      for FcγR which, in different contexts, may either underpin the therapeutic mAb 
      action such as immune agonism or may trigger catastrophic adverse effects. The still 
      unmet therapeutic need in many cancers, inflammatory diseases or emerging infections 
      such as SARS-CoV-2, requires increased effort on the development of improved and 
      novel mAbs. A more mature appreciation of the immunobiology of individual FcγR 
      function and the complexity of the relationships between FcγRs and antibodies is 
      fuelling efforts to develop more potent "next-gen" therapeutic antibodies. Such 
      development strategies now include focused glycan or protein engineering of the Fc 
      to increase affinity and/or tailor specificity for selective engagement of 
      individual activating FcγRs or the inhibitory FcγRIIb or alternatively, for the 
      ablation of FcγR interaction altogether. This review touches on recent aspects FcγR 
      and IgG immunobiology and its relationship to the present and future actions of 
      therapeutic mAbs.

AB  - The novel coronavirus pneumonia (new coronavirus pneumonia) (NCP) has been prevalent 
      in Wuhan and spread rapidly to all of our country. Some cases can develop into ARDS, 
      or even death. We will share the treatment experience of severe NCP with the 
      first-line treatment experience. The best respiratory support mode should be 
      selected, but the timing of intubation and protection during intubation are two 
      difficulties; patients with high level peep and poor effect in prone position can be 
      given ECMO support. For NCP patients with mechanical ventilation, reasonable 
      sedation and analgesia strategies should be formulated; delirium should not be 
      ignored. In addition, there is up regulation of inflammatory factors in patients 
      with severe NCP, but the effect of renal replacement therapy needs to be further 
      confirmed by clinical research.

AB  - Prevention and control about the situation of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) 
      are grim at present. In addition to supporting the frontline actively, medical 
      workers in general surgery spare no efforts in making good diagnosis and treatment 
      of specialized diseases by optimizing treatment process, providing medical advice 
      online, mastering indications of delayed operation and emergency operation 
      reasonably, etc. Budd-Chiari syndrome is a complex disorder, and severity of the 
      disease varies, serious cases can be life threatening. While fighting the epidemic, 
      medical workers should also ensure the medical needs of patients. However, instead 
      of continuing the traditional treatment, a new management system should be 
      developed. Based on the characteristics of Budd-Chiari syndrome patients in China 
      and our experience, we divide the patients into ordinary and critical cases, and 
      treatment strategies suitable for the epidemic period of COVID-19 are put forward 
      for reference and discussion by physicians.

AB  - Objective: To understand the clinical characteristics, change of liver function, 
      influencing factors and prognosis in hospitalized patients with coronavirus 
      disease-19 (COVID-19) combined with liver injury. Methods: The general conditions, 
      biochemical indicators of liver, blood clotting mechanism, routine blood test, 
      UGT1A1 * 28 gene polymorphism and other data of 40 cases with COVID-19 admitted to 
      the isolation ward of Tangdu Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. The clinical 
      characteristics, influencing factors and prognosis of liver injury in patients with 
      liver injury group and those with normal liver function group were compared. The 
      mean of two samples in univariate analysis was compared by t-test and analysis of 
      variance. The counting data was measured by χ(2) tests. The non-normal distribution 
      measurement data were described by the median, and the non-parametric test was used. 
      Statistically significant influencing factors were used as the independent variables 
      in univariate analysis. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to analyze 
      the main influencing factors of liver injury. Results: Of the 40 cases, 25 were male 
      (62.5%) and 15 were female (37.5%), aged 22 to 83 (53.87 ± 15.84) years. Liver 
      injury was occurred in 22 cases (55%) during the course of the disease. Alanine 
      aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level was initially 
      increased (4.4 to 3.5 times of the normal value) along with decrease of albumin in 
      the second week, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Ten 
      cases (43.5%) had highest abnormal total blood bilirubin (54.1 μmol/ L). There was 
      no correlation between the increase in transaminase and the increase in total blood 
      bilirubin (R = -0.006, P = 0.972). Three cases had prothrombin activity (PTA) of ≤ 
      50%, 10 cases had elevated FDP, and 13 cases had elevated D-dimer, all of whom were 
      severe or critically ill. Liver function injury was more likely to occur in patients 
      who used many types of drugs and large amounts of hormones (P = 0.002, P = 0.031), 
      and there was no correlation with the TA6TA7 mutation in the UGT1A1 * 28 gene locus. 
      Multiple regression analysis showed that the occurrence of liver injury was only 
      related to critical illness. The liver function of all patients had recovered within 
      one week after conventional liver protection treatment. Conclusion: COVID-19 
      combined with liver function injury may be due to the slight elevation of 
      transaminase, mostly around the second week of the disease course. Severe patients 
      have a higher proportion of liver injury, and critical type is an independent risk 
      factor for liver injury.

LID - 10.3760/cma.j.cn112151-20200225-00138 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To investigate the clinical characteristics and placental pathology of 
      2019-nCoV infection in pregnancy, and to evaluate intrauterine vertical transmission 
      potential of 2019-nCoV infection. Methods: The placentas delivered from pregnant 
      women with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection which were received in the Department of 
      Pathology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science 
      and Technology collected by February 4th, 2020 and retrospectively studied. Their 
      clinical material including placental tissue and lung CT, and laboratory results 
      were collected, meanwhile, nucleic acid detection of 2019-nCoV of the placentas were 
      performed by RT-PCR. Results: Three placentas delivered from pregnant women with 
      confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, who were all in their third trimester with emergency 
      caesarean section. All of the three patients presented with fever (one before 
      caesarean and two in postpartum), and had no significant leukopenia and lymphopenia. 
      Neonatal throat swabs from three newborns were tested for 2019-nCoV, and all samples 
      were negative for the nucleic acid of 2019-nCoV. One premature infant was 
      transferred to Department of Neonatology due to low birth weight. By the end of 
      February 25, 2020, none of the three patients developed severe 2019-nCoV pneumonia 
      or died(two patients had been cured and discharged, while another one had been 
      transferred to a square cabin hospital for isolation treatment). There were various 
      degrees of fibrin deposition inside and around the villi with local syncytial nodule 
      increases in all three placentas. One case of placenta showed the concomitant 
      morphology of chorionic hemangioma and another one with massive placental 
      infarction. No pathological change of villitis and chorioamnionitis was observed in 
      our observation of three cases. All samples from three placentas were negative for 
      the nucleic acid of 2019-nCoV. Conclusions: The clinical characteristics of pregnant 
      women with 2019-nCoV infection in late pregnancy are similar to those of 
      non-pregnant patients, and no severe adverse pregnancy outcome is found in the 3 
      cases of our observation. Pathological study suggests that there are no 
      morphological changes related to infection in the three placentas. Currently no 
      evidence for intrauterine vertical transmission of 2019-nCoV is found in the three 
      women infected by 2019-nCoV in their late pregnancy.

TI  - Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients 
      with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed 
      clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described. 
      METHODS: In this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult 
      inpatients (≥18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan 
      Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had 
      died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, 
      including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic 
      medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We used 
      univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk 
      factors associated with in-hospital death. FINDINGS: 191 patients (135 from 
      Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this 
      study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital. 91 (48%) patients had a 
      comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed 
      by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients). 
      Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with 
      older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03-1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher 
      Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61-12·23; p<0·0001), and 
      d-dimer greater than 1 μg/L (18·42, 2·64-128·55; p=0·0033) on admission. Median 
      duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0-24·0) in survivors, but 
      SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors. The longest observed 
      duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days. INTERPRETATION: The potential 
      risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/L could 
      help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage. 
      Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of 
      infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future. FUNDING:

AB  - Coronaviruses are the well-known cause of severe respiratory, enteric and systemic 
      infections in a wide range of hosts including man, mammals, fish, and avian. The 
      scientific interest on coronaviruses increased after the emergence of Severe Acute 
      Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreaks in 2002-2003 followed by 
      Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV). This decade's first CoV, named 
      2019-nCoV, emerged from Wuhan, China, and declared as 'Public Health Emergency of 
      International Concern' on January 30(th), 2020 by the World Health Organization 
      (WHO). As on February 4, 2020, 425 deaths reported in China only and one death 
      outside China (Philippines). In a short span of time, the virus spread has been 
      noted in 24 countries. The zoonotic transmission (animal-to-human) is suspected as 
      the route of disease origin. The genetic analyses predict bats as the most probable 
      source of 2019-nCoV though further investigations needed to confirm the origin of 
      the novel virus. The ongoing nCoV outbreak highlights the hidden wild animal 
      reservoir of the deadly viruses and possible threat of spillover zoonoses as well. 
      The successful virus isolation attempts have made doors open for developing better 
      diagnostics and effective vaccines helping in combating the spread of the virus to 
      newer areas.

AB  - Novel coronavirus pneumonia was novel coronavirus infection that has dominated 
      pulmonary infection since December 2019. The main manifestations were fever, dry 
      cough, shortness of breath, normal or leukopenia in peripheral blood and changes in 
      chest CT and in severe cases, multiple organ failure might occur. The National 
      Health Commission, PRC has revised the consensus on diagnosis and treatment seven 
      times in a short period of time, indicating the growing understanding of the 
      disease. Patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia usually had history of travelling 
      or living in the epidemic area including Wuhan within 14 days before onset, or have 
      been exposed to patients who had fever or respiratory symptoms from the epidemic 
      area, or had clustering diseases. However, novel coronavirus pneumonia was becoming 
      more and more blurred after vanishing epidemic. The diagnosis and differential 
      diagnosis of novel coronavirus pneumonia was facing challenges not only because of 
      large number of tourists increasing dramatically after the relieving of epidemic, 
      but also patients with other diseases return from different areas to search for 
      medical care. In this article, the clinical and chest imaging features of the novel 
      coronavirus pneumonia were reviewed and compared with other infections and 
      non-infectious diffuse pulmonary diseases. We were trying to find the similarities 
      and differences among them, and to identify clues to the diagnosis of novel 
      coronavirus pneumonia, so as to ensure accurate diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - The next decade is likely to produce any number of global challenges that will 
      affect health and health care, including pan-national infections such as the new 
      coronavirus COVID-19 and others that will be related to global warming. Nurses will 
      be required to react to these events, even though they will also be affected as 
      ordinary citizens. The future resilience of healthcare services will depend on 
      having sufficient numbers of nurses who are adequately resourced to face the coming 
      challenges.

TI  - Clinical and computed tomographic imaging features of novel coronavirus pneumonia 
      caused by SARS-CoV-2.

LID - 10.1016/j.jinf.2020.02.017 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the clinical and imaging characteristics of computed 
      tomography (CT) in novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) caused by SARS-CoV-2. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on the imaging findings of 
      patients confirmed with COVID-19 pneumonia who had chest CT scanning and treatment 
      after disease onset. The clinical and imaging data were analyzed. RESULTS: Fifty 
      patients were enrolled, including mild type in nine, common in 28, severe in 10 and 
      critically severe in the rest three. Mild patients (29 years) were significantly 
      (P<0.03) younger than either common (44.5 years) or severe (54.7) and critically 
      severe (65.7 years) patients, and common patients were also significantly (P<0.03) 
      younger than severe and critically severe patients. Mild patients had low to 
      moderate fever (<39.1 °C), 49 (98%) patients had normal or slightly reduced 
      leukocyte count, 14 (28%) had decreased counts of lymphocytes, and 26 (52%) patients 
      had increased C-reactive protein. Nine mild patients were negative in CT imaging. 
      For all the other types of NCP, the lesion was in the right upper lobe in 30 cases, 
      right middle lobe in 22, right lower lobe in 39, left upper lobe in 33 and left 
      lower lobe in 36. The lesion was primarily located in the peripheral area under the 
      pleura with possible extension towards the pulmonary hilum. Symmetrical lesions were 
      seen in 26 cases and asymmetrical in 15. The density of lesion was mostly uneven 
      with ground glass opacity as the primary presentation accompanied by partial 
      consolidation and fibrosis. CONCLUSION: CT imaging presentations of NCP are mostly 
      patchy ground glass opacities in the peripheral areas under the pleura with partial 
      consolidation which will be absorbed with formation of fibrotic stripes if improved. 
      CT scanning provides important bases for early diagnosis and treatment of NCP.

TI  - Structure of mouse coronavirus spike protein complexed with receptor reveals 
      mechanism for viral entry.

AB  - Coronaviruses recognize a variety of receptors using different domains of their 
      envelope-anchored spike protein. How these diverse receptor recognition patterns 
      affect viral entry is unknown. Mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) is the only known 
      coronavirus that uses the N-terminal domain (NTD) of its spike to recognize a 
      protein receptor, CEACAM1a. Here we determined the cryo-EM structure of MHV spike 
      complexed with mouse CEACAM1a. The trimeric spike contains three receptor-binding S1 
      heads sitting on top of a trimeric membrane-fusion S2 stalk. Three receptor 
      molecules bind to the sides of the spike trimer, where three NTDs are located. 
      Receptor binding induces structural changes in the spike, weakening the interactions 
      between S1 and S2. Using protease sensitivity and negative-stain EM analyses, we 
      further showed that after protease treatment of the spike, receptor binding 
      facilitated the dissociation of S1 from S2, allowing S2 to transition from 
      pre-fusion to post-fusion conformation. Together these results reveal a new role of 
      receptor binding in MHV entry: in addition to its well-characterized role in viral 
      attachment to host cells, receptor binding also induces the conformational change of 
      the spike and hence the fusion of viral and host membranes. Our study provides new 
      mechanistic insight into coronavirus entry and highlights the diverse entry 
      mechanisms used by different viruses.

AB  - The recent outbreak of respiratory illness in Wuhan, China is caused by a novel 
      coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV, which is genetically close to a bat-derived 
      coronavirus. 2019-nCoV is categorized as beta genus coronavirus, same as the two 
      other strains-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle 
      East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Antiviral drugs commonly used in 
      clinical practice, including neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, paramivir, 
      zanamivir, etc.), ganciclovir, acyclovir and ribavirin, are invalid for 2019-nCoV 
      and not recommended. Drugs are possibly effective for 2019-nCoV include: remdesivir, 
      lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon-β, convalescent 
      plasma, and monoclonal antibodies. But the efficacy and safety of these drugs for 
      2019-nCoV pneumonia patients need to be assessed by further clinical trials.

AB  - Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) is a highly infectious disease, has a long 
      incubation period and a variety of clinical manifestations, which has a significant 
      impact on public health and life. Afterwards, scientific and standardized work 
      processing during the epidemic is of great significance for prevention and control. 
      In order to implement the central government's decision-making deployment and defeat 
      the NCP as soon as possible, we had focused on the key points in the clinical work 
      of general surgery according to latest relevant guidelines, literature and 
      experience in epidemic prevention. Finally, we drafted the prevention and control 
      strategies and recommendations to make a reference for medical staff of general 
      surgery to fight NCP.

AB  - Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is mainly transmitted by respiratory droplets 
      and close contact. Pulmonary function testing procedures have been associated with 
      an increasing risk of COVID-19 transmission among patients/subjects and medical 
      staffs. Effective prevention and control strategies must be compulsorily implemented 
      to prevent nosocomial infection. This recommendation is intended to be followed by 
      healthcare workers (HCWs) of pulmonary function testing laboratory when COVID-19 is 
      in epidemic. Based on the features of pulmonary function testing, precaution 
      principles and strategies are developed in three aspects of management for HCWs, 
      operating procedure, environment and equipment. Indications of pulmonary function 
      testing should be followed strictly. It is strongly recommended to suspend the test 
      for the confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 during the contagious stage, and to 
      postpone the test for other patients if it is not imperative. Medical personnel 
      should mandatorily adhere to the standard stratification of precaution measures. 
      Patients/Subjects should be isolated in a separate area for testing. Disposable 
      in-line filters must be used during pulmonary function testing. Cleaning and 
      disinfection procedures for environment and equipment in pulmonary function testing 
      laboratory should be paid more attention.

AB  - In December 2019, a new outbreak of coronavirus pneumonia began to occur. Its 
      pathogen is 2019-nCoV, which has the characteristics of strong infectivity and 
      general susceptibility. The current situation of prevention and control of new 
      coronavirus pneumonia is severe. In this context, as front-line medical workers 
      bearing important responsibilities and pressure, while through strict management 
      strategy, we can minimize the risk of infection exposure. By summarizing the 
      research progress and guidelines in recent years in the fields of colorectal cancer 
      disease screening, treatment strategies(including early colorectal cancer, locally 
      advanced colorectal cancer, obstructive colorectal cancer, metastatic colorectal 
      cancer and the treatment of patients after neoadjuvant therapy), the choice of 
      medication and time limit for adjuvant therapy, the protective measures for patients 
      undergoing emergency surgery, the re-examination of postoperative patients and the 
      protection of medical staff, etc., authors improve treatment strategies in order to 
      provide more choices for patients to obtain the best treatment under the severe 
      epidemic situation of new coronavirus pneumonia. Meanwhile we hope that it can also 
      provide more timely treatment modeling schemes for colleagues.

AB  - The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia occurred in Wuhan, Hubei province of 
      China, at the end of 2019, and spread rapidly across the country. After the outbreak 
      of this disease, the overwhelming majority of cities have launched the "first level 
      response" and the regular diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients are greatly 
      affected. The digestive systemic cancer is the most common malignancy. Most patients 
      are diagnosed in the advanced stage with poor prognosis. The epidemic of novel 
      coronavirus pneumonia poses new challenges to diagnosis and treatment of the 
      patients with digestive system malignancies. Based on the fully understanding of the 
      characteristics of digestive system tumors, we should change the treatment strategy 
      and adopt more reasonable treatment strategy timely during the epidemic period to 
      minimize the adverse effects of the epidemic of novel coronavirus pneumonia on the 
      treatment.

AB  - At the end of 2019, sporadic and clustered case with "pneumonia of unknown origin" 
      emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province. The causative pathogen was quickly confirmed as 
      "2019-nCoV" . The epidemic soon spread throughout the country and became a pandemic 
      in over a month. Government and medical institutions across the country mobilized 
      all kinds of resources and took a variety of measures to actively treat patients and 
      stop the epidemic. Based on current studies, the author summarized the clinical 
      characteristics and evolution of the novel viral pneumonia, and proposed the key 
      points of diagnosis and treatment, the scientific management of both confirmed and 
      suspected cases, and the scientific management of disease prevention and control.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, 
      treatment and the short-term prognosis of 31 cases of 2019 novel 
      coronavirus(2019-nCoV) infection in children from six provinces (autonomous region) 
      in northern China. Methods: A retrospective analysis of the epidemiological history, 
      clinical symptoms, signs, laboratory examinations, chest imaging, treatment and the 
      short-term prognosis of 31 cases of 2019-nCoV was conducted. The patients were 
      diagnosed between January 25th, 2020 and February 21st, 2020 in 21 hospitals in 17 
      cities of six provinces(autonomous region) of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Hebei, Henan 
      and Shandong. Results: The age of the 31 children with 2019-nCoV infection was 7 
      years and 1 month (6 months -17 years). Nine cases (29%) were imported cases. Other 
      21 cases (68%) had contact with confirmed infected adults. One case (3%) had contact 
      with asymptomatic returnees from Wuhan. Among the 31 children, 28 patients (90%) 
      were family cluster cases. The clinical types were asymptomatic type in 4 cases 
      (13%), mild type in 13 cases (42%), and common type in 14 cases (45%). No severe or 
      critical type existed. The most common symptom was fever (n=20, 65%), including 1 
      case of high fever, 9 cases of moderate fever, 10 cases of low fever. Fever lasted 
      from 1 day to 9 days. The fever of fifteen cases lasted for ≤3 d, while in other 5 
      cases lasted > 3 d. Other symptoms included cough (n=14, 45%), fatigue (n=3, 10%) 
      and diarrhea (n=3, 9%). Pharyngalgia, runny nose, dizziness, headache and vomiting 
      were rare. In the early stage, the total leukocytes count in peripheral blood 
      decreased in 2 cases (6%), the lymphocytes count decreased in 2 cases (6%), and the 
      platelet count increased in 2 cases (6%).Elevation of C-reactive protein (10%, 
      3/30), erythrocyte sedimentation rate(19%,4/21), procalcitonin(4%,1/28), liver 
      enzyme(22%, 6/27) and muscle enzyme (15%, 4/27) occurred in different proportions. 
      Renal function and blood glucose were normal. There were abnormal chest CT changes 
      in 14 cases, including 9 cases with patchy ground glass opacities and nodules, 
      mostly located in the lower lobe of both lungs near the pleural area. After 
      receiving supportive treatment, the viral nucleic acid turned negative in 25 cases 
      within 7-23 days. Among them, 24 children (77%) recovered and were discharged from 
      hospital. No death occurred. Conclusions: In this case series, 2019-nCoV infections 
      in children from six provinces (autonomous region) in northern China are mainly 
      caused by close family contact. Clinical types are asymptomatic, mild and common 
      types. Clinical manifestations and laboratory examination results are nonspecific. 
      Close contact history of epidemiology, nucleic acid detection and chest imaging are 
      important bases for diagnosis. After general treatment, the short-term prognosis is 
      good.

AB  - Novel coronavirus has become a global health hazard and its high infectivity is 
      alarming. The imaging findings of the 2019-nCoV infection in our young diabetic 
      patient featured ground-glass opacities and consolidations in both lungs. The lung 
      lesions may involute rapidly during the course. The patient showed improvement both 
      clinically and on computed tomography imaging at discharged after 2 weeks'treatment. 
      Computed tomography scans of patients helped monitor the changes continuously, which 
      could timely provide the information of the evolution of the disease or therapeutic 
      effect to clinicians.

      novel coronavirus: implications for the dermatology department.
LID - 10.1111/bjd.19011 [doi]
AB  - As of Feb 15, 2020, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has rapidly spread throughout 
      China and across the world with more than 60,000 laboratory-confirmed cases. Due to 
      the current lack of specific treatment and the risk of transmission during the viral 
      incubation period, infection prevention and control of 2019-nCoV are both urgent and 
      critical to global health. In this article, we aim to highlight the necessity of 
      implementing protective measures, and recommend how to set proper emergency 
      management plans for preventing and controlling nosocomial infection of 2019-nCoV in 
      dermatology departments.

LID - 10.1111/jebm.12376 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate the basic reproduction number of the Wuhan novel coronavirus 
      (2019-nCoV). METHODS: Based on the susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) 
      compartment model and the assumption that the infectious cases with symptoms 
      occurred before 26 January, 2020 are resulted from free propagation without 
      intervention, we estimate the basic reproduction number of 2019-nCoV according to 
      the reported confirmed cases and suspected cases, as well as the theoretical 
      estimated number of infected cases by other research teams, together with some 
      epidemiological determinants learned from the severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      (SARS). RESULTS: The basic reproduction number fall between 2.8 and 3.3 by using the 
      real-time reports on the number of 2019-nCoV-infected cases from People's Daily in 
      China and fall between 3.2 and 3.9 on the basis of the predicted number of infected 
      cases from international colleagues. CONCLUSIONS: The early transmission ability of 
      2019-nCoV is close to or slightly higher than SARS. It is a controllable disease 
      with moderate to high transmissibility. Timely and effective control measures are 
      needed to prevent the further transmissions.

AB  - The new coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), also named as COVID-19 by WHO on Feb 11 2020, 
      is now causing a severe public health emergency in China since. The number of 
      diagnosed cases is more than 40,000 until the submission of this manuscript. 
      Coronavirus has caused several epidemic situations world widely, but the present 
      contagious disease caused by 2019 new coronavirus is unprecedentedly fulminating. 
      The published cohorts of 2019 new coronavirus (n-Cov) are single-center studies, or 
      retrospective studies. We here share the therapeutic experiences of NCP treatment 
      with literature review. Combination of Ribavirin and interferon-α is recommended by 
      the 5(th) edition National Health Commission's Regimen (Revised Edition) because of 
      the effect on Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the effectiveness of 
      Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Remdisivir needs to be confirmed by randomized controlled 
      trial (RCT), given the situation of no specific antivirus drug on NCP is 
      unavailable. Systemic glucocorticosteroid is recommended as a short term use (1~2 
      mg·kg(-1)·d(-1), 3~5 d) by the 5(th) edition National Health Commission's Regimen 
      (Revised Edition) yet RCTs are expected to confirm the effectiveness. Inappropriate 
      application of antibiotics should be avoided, especially the combination of 
      broad-spectrum antibiotics, for the NCP is not often complicated with bacterial 
      infection.

AB  - The novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) has cost a great loss to the health and 
      economic property of Chines people. Under such a special circumstance, how to deal 
      with such patients with acute aortic syndrome has become a serious challenge. Rapid 
      diagnosis of concomitant NCP, safe and effective transportation, implementation of 
      the interventional procedure, protection of vascular surgical team and postoperative 
      management and follow-up of such patients have become urgent problems for us. 
      Combined with the latest novel government documents, the literature and the 
      experiences from Wuhan, we answered the above questions briefly and plainly. It also 
      hopes to inspire the national vascular surgeons to manage critical emergencies in 
      vascular surgery and even routine vascular diseases with NCP, as a final point to 
      limit the severe epidemic situation, and minimize the damage of NCP.

AB  - Since December 2019, Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19), a new emerging infection 
      disease occurred in Wuhan, has spread in 27 countries and regions. The clusters of 
      many cases were reported with the epidemic progresses. We collected currently 
      available information for 377 COVID-19 clusters (1 719 cases), excluded the hospital 
      clusters and Hubei cases, during the period from January 1, 2020 to February 20, 
      2020. There were 297 family clusters (79%), case median 4; 39 clusters of dining 
      (10%), case median 5; 23 clusters of shopping malls or supermarkets (6%), case 
      median 13; 12 clusters of work units (3%), case median 6, and 6 clusters of 
      transportation. We selected 325 cases to estimate the incubation period and found 
      its range is 1 to 20 days, median was 7 days, and mode was 4 days. The analysis of 
      the epidemic situation in a department store in China indicates that there is a 
      possibility of patients as the source of infection during the incubation period of 
      the epidemic. From February 5, 2020 to February 21, 2020, 634 persons were infected 
      in the Diamond Princess Liner. All persons are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. The older, 
      patients during the incubation period and the worse environment may be the cause of 
      the cases rising. The progress of the two typical outbreaks clearly demonstrates the 
      spread of the early cases in Wuhan. Whatever happens, screening and isolating close 
      contacts remains essential except for clinical treatment during the epidemic. 
      Especially for the healthy people in the epidemic area, isolation is the key.

AB  - Since December 2019, a cluster of patients have been diagnosed to be infected with 
      2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan, China. The epidemic has been spreading 
      to other areas of the country and abroad. A few cases have progressed rapidly to 
      acute respiratory distress syndrome and/or multiple organ function failure. The 
      epidemiological survey has indicated that the general population is susceptible to 
      2019-nCoV. A total of 14 children (6 months to 14 years of age, including 5 cases in 
      Wuhan) have been confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCoV in China so far. In order 
      to further standardize and enhance the clinical management of 2019-nCoV infection in 
      children, reduce the incidence, and decrease the number of severe cases, we have 
      formulated this diagnosis and treatment recommendation according to the recent 
      information at home and abroad.

AB  - The 'Healing the Schism: Epidemiology, Medicine, and the Public's Health' by 
      professor Kerr L. White's be published has a history of nearly 30 years. Since then, 
      although scholars have appealed to incorporating public health and clinical medicine 
      education, and breaking down separations between public health and clinical 
      workforce in China, the effect is yet not so obvious. The outbreak of coronavirus 
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) has opened a public class on the treatment, prevention and 
      control of infectious diseases for the Chinese citizens. Consequently, the Chinese 
      people have higher expectations on the modernization of public health governance, 
      and the social atmosphere of incorporating preventive medicine and clinical medical 
      education is establishing. In future, when combating with novel infectious diseases 
      and public health emergencies, the response capacity of public health system and 
      treatment capacity of clinical system will be significantly improved, while the 
      situation on insufficient integration of prevention and treatment is bound to be 
      reversed.

AB  - Since the outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia in December 2019, the diagnosis 
      and treatment of patients with cancer have been facing great challenges. Although 
      oncologists are not fighting on the front line to against the epidemic, during this 
      special period, we should not only protect patients, their families and medical 
      staff from the infection of novel Coronavirus, but also minimize the impact of the 
      epidemic on the diagnosis and the treatment of patients with cancer. Combining the 
      guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of tumors with our clinical experience, in 
      this epidemic period, we discuss the strategies for diagnosis, treatment, and 
      follow-up of malignant tumors of the digestive system in this article.

PG  - 91-95
AB  - 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection has been spreading in China since 
      December 2019. Neonates are presumably the high-risk population susceptible to 
      2019-nCoV due to immature immune function. The neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) 
      should be prepared for 2019-nCoV infections as far as possible. The emergency 
      response plan enables the efficient response capability of NICU. During the epidemic 
      of 2019-nCoV, the emergency response plan for the NICU should be based on the actual 
      situation, including diagnosis, isolation, and treatment, as well as available 
      equipment and staffing, and take into account the psychosocial needs of the families 
      and neonatal care staff.

PG  - E008

AB  - Objective: To investigate the principles of differential diagnosis of pulmonary 
      infiltrates in cancer patients during the outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) 
      by analyzing one case of lymphoma who presented pulmonary ground-glass opacities 
      (GGO) after courses of chemotherapy. Methods: Baseline demographics and 
      clinicopathological data of eligible patients were retrieved from medical records. 
      Information of clinical manifestations, history of epidemiology, lab tests and chest 
      CT scan images of visiting patients from February 13 to February 28 were collected. 
      Literatures about pulmonary infiltrates in cancer patients were searched from 
      databases including PUBMED, EMBASE and CNKI. Results: Among the 139 cancer patients 
      underwent chest CT scans before chemotherapy, pulmonary infiltrates were identified 
      in eight patients (5.8%), five of whom were characterized as GGOs in lungs. 
      2019-nCoV nuclear acid testing was performed in three patients and the results were 
      negative. One case was a 66-year-old man diagnosed as non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 
      underwent CHOP chemotherapy regimen. His chest CT scan image displayed multiple GGOs 
      in lungs and the complete blood count showed decreased lymphocytes. This patient 
      denied any contact with confirmed/suspected cases of 2019-nCoV infection and without 
      fever and other respiratory symptoms. Considering the negative result of nuclear 
      acid testing, this patient was presumptively diagnosed as viral pneumonia and an 
      experiential anti-infection treatment had been prescribed for him. Conclusions: The 
      2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) complicates the clinical scenario of 
      pulmonary infiltrates in cancer patients. The epidemic history, clinical 
      manifestation, CT scan image and lab test should be combined consideration. The 
      2019-nCoV nuclear acid testing might be applicated in more selected patients. Active 
      anti-infection treatment and surveillance of patient condition should be initiated 
      if infectious disease is considered.

      current gold standard for the etiological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is (real 
      time) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on respiratory tract 
      specimens, the diagnostic accuracy of this technique shall be considered a foremost 
      prerequisite. Overall, potential RT-PCR vulnerabilities include general 
      preanalytical issues such as identification problems, inadequate procedures for 
      collection, handling, transport and storage of the swabs, collection of 
      inappropriate or inadequate material (for quality or volume), presence of 
      interfering substances, manual errors, as well as specific aspects such as sample 
      contamination and testing patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. Some analytical 
      problems may also contribute to jeopardize the diagnostic accuracy, including 
      testing outside the diagnostic window, active viral recombination, use of 
      inadequately validated assays, insufficient harmonization, instrument 
      malfunctioning, along with other specific technical issues. Some practical 
      indications can hence be identified for minimizing the risk of diagnostic errors, 
      encompassing the improvement of diagnostic accuracy by combining clinical evidence 
      with results of chest computed tomography (CT) and RT-PCR, interpretation of RT-PCR 
      results according to epidemiologic, clinical and radiological factors, recollection 
      and testing of upper (or lower) respiratory specimens in patients with negative 
      RT-PCR test results and high suspicion or probability of infection, dissemination of 
      clear instructions for specimen (especially swab) collection, management and 
      storage, together with refinement of molecular target(s) and thorough compliance 
      with analytical procedures, including quality assurance.

AB  - Only a month after the outbreak of pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV, more than 
      forty-thousand people were infected. This put enormous pressure on the Chinese 
      government, medical healthcare provider, and the general public, but also made the 
      international community deeply nervous. On the 25th day after the outbreak, the 
      Chinese government implemented strict traffic restrictions on the area where the 
      2019-nCoV had originated-Hubei province, whose capital city is Wuhan. Ten days 
      later, the rate of increase of cases in Hubei showed a significant difference 
      (p = 0.0001) compared with the total rate of increase in other provinces of China. 
      These preliminary data suggest the effectiveness of a traffic restriction policy for 
      this pandemic thus far. At the same time, solid financial support and improved 
      research ability, along with network communication technology, also greatly 
      facilitated the application of epidemic prevention measures. These measures were 
      motivated by the need to provide effective treatment of patients, and involved 
      consultation with three major groups in policy formulation-public health experts, 
      the government, and the general public. It was also aided by media and information 
      technology, as well as international cooperation. This experience will provide China 
      and other countries with valuable lessons for quickly coordinating and coping with 
      future public health emergencies.

AB  - The outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) has become a public health 
      emergency in China. Chinese authorities and health agencies had devoted great 
      efforts to control this disease. As surgeons specialized in the treatment of 
      gastrointestinal tumors, we should always be aware of the prevention for NCP and 
      incorporate this awareness into every detail of clinical practice. For the patients 
      with gastrointestinal tumors, pre-admission screening should be done in order to 
      rule out NCP. Real-time RT-PCR panel and chest CT scan should be conducted for 
      patients with fever (>37.3℃), travel history to Hubei Province within 14 days, or 
      contact history with residents from Wuhan district within 14 days. Prevention 
      measures for both medical staffs and the screen-negative admitted patients should 
      also be enhanced because false negative is possible. Medical instruments should be 
      properly discarded or disinfected according to standardized procedures established 
      by the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC). Surgical operation 
      should be reduced at a minimal level to prevent cross infection in this special 
      period.Surgical intervention for benign tumor should be postponed. For malignant 
      tumor, multidisciplinary therapy (MDT) is recommended and non-surgical anti-tumor 
      therapy should be selected with higher priority. Neoadjuvant therapy is highly 
      recommended for gastrointestinal cancer at advanced stages that meet the indications 
      of NCCN guideline (gastric cancer T stage ≥ 2/rectal cancer T stage ≥ 3/unresectable 
      colon cancer). Gastric or esophagogastricjunction (EGJ) malignant tumor with 
      obstruction can be managed with gastric tube decompression or stent placement to 
      relieve the symptoms. Transnasal enteral feeding tube intubation/percutaneous 
      endoscopic gastrostomy could be adopted to ensure enteral nutrition supply. For 
      colorectal malignancy with simple intestinal obstruction, stent placement can 
      achieve a high success rate, which not only helps avoid emergency surgery, but also 
      creates a better condition for subsequent surgery. Transcatheter arterial 
      embolization for hemostasis is an alternative choice for gastrointestinal tumor with 
      bleeding. However, emergency operation still must be performed for patients with 
      acute uncontrolled bleeding, obstruction or after other alternative treatment 
      measures fail. All cases with suspicious or confirmed with NCP must be reported to 
      the local CDC department. All invasive intervention must be performed in a 
      designated isolation area. Tertiary prevention measure must be adopted for all 
      anesthetists with additional face mask or medical goggle protection to prevent 
      respiratory droplet transmission. Preventive enterostomy is preferable in lower 
      digestive tract surgery. Thoroughly disinfecting the operating room after surgery is 
      necessary. Fever after surgery must be carefully differentiated whether it's caused 
      by post-surgery abdominal infection/inflammation or NCP. Single-room isolation and 
      related examinations should be performed according to the standard procedures. We 
      believe that with the unprecedentedly joint efforts of doctors and patients, we will 
      eventually win this war against NCP.

PG  - 558-570
LID - 10.1080/22221751.2020.1736644 [doi]
AB  - World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 
      2019 (COVID-19) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The virus was 
      named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the 
      International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Human infection with SARS-CoV-2 
      leads to a wide range of clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic, mild, 
      moderate to severe. The severe cases present with pneumonia, which can progress to 
      acute respiratory distress syndrome. The outbreak provides an opportunity for 
      real-time tracking of an animal coronavirus that has just crossed species barrier to 
      infect humans. The outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection is largely determined by 
      virus-host interaction. Here, we review the discovery, zoonotic origin, animal 
      hosts, transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in relation to its interplay 
      with host antiviral defense. A comparison with SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus, community-acquired human coronaviruses and other pathogenic 
      viruses including human immunodeficiency viruses is made. We summarize current 
      understanding of the induction of a proinflammatory cytokine storm by other highly 
      pathogenic human coronaviruses, their adaptation to humans and their usurpation of 
      the cell death programmes. Important questions concerning the interaction between 
      SARS-CoV-2 and host antiviral defence, including asymptomatic and presymptomatic 
      virus shedding, are also discussed.

AB  - In order to achieve the overall victory of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease 
      epidemic in this 'war', especially to prevent the disease recurrence from rebounding 
      during the resumption of labor, the government has not loosened any control of 
      personnel mobility, which has obviously affected the normal examination and 
      treatment of lung cancer patients under the influence of this epidemic. During the 
      epidemic period, cancer patients with low immunity levels face the double ordeals of 
      disease and epidemic situation. Compared with the general population, they are more 
      likely to be infected with the new coronavirus. Among the infected cancer patients, 
      lung cancer is the most common type. It is necessary to provide more appropriate 
      individualized treatment recommendations for patients with lung cancer based on the 
      epidemic situation of the patient's location and in combination with the patient's 
      own condition. Through active prevention of infection, timely conversion of 
      treatment strategies, online and offline joint control, and positive psychological 
      counseling, we significantly hope to help patients with lung cancer to survive this 
      difficult period.

LID - 10.1042/CS20200163 [doi]
AB  - A new coronavirus, referred to as SARS-CoV-2, is responsible for the recent outbreak 
      of severe respiratory disease. This outbreak first detected in Wuhan, China in 
      December 2019, has spread to other regions of China and to 25 other countries as of 
      January, 2020. It has been known since the 2003 SARS epidemic that the receptor 
      critical for SARS-CoV entry into host cells is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 
      (ACE2). The S1 domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV attaches the virus to its 
      cellular receptor ACE2 on the host cells. We thought that it is timely to explain 
      the connection between the SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 and the rationale for soluble 
      ACE2 as a potential therapy.

AB  - Ionic calcium (Ca(2+)) is a versatile intracellular second messenger that plays 
      important roles in cellular physiological and pathological processes. Porcine 
      deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is an emerging enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes 
      serious vomiting and diarrhea in suckling piglets. In this study, the role of Ca(2+) 
      to PDCoV infection was investigated. PDCoV infection was found to upregulate 
      intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations of IPI-2I cells. Chelating extracellular Ca(2+) 
      by EGTA inhibited PDCoV replication, and this inhibitory effect was overcome by 
      replenishment with CaCl(2). Treatment with Ca(2+) channel blockers, particularly the 
      L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker diltiazem hydrochloride, inhibited PDCoV infection 
      significantly. Mechanistically, diltiazem hydrochloride reduces PDCoV infection by 
      inhibiting the replication step of the viral replication cycle. Additionally, 
      knockdown of CACNA1S, the L-type Ca(2+) voltage-gated channel subunit, inhibited 
      PDCoV replication. The combined results demonstrate that PDCoV modulates calcium 
      influx to favor its replication.

AB  - The outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is spreading rapidly. In 
      order to prevent cluster outbreaks, the government strengthened the management and 
      control of personnel mobility, which had a great impact on the examination and 
      treatment of breast cancer patients. This paper discusses how to realize scientific 
      health management of breast cancer patients outside the hospital based on the 
      existing epidemic situation, characteristics of breast cancer patients and public 
      health safety factors. The breast cancer patients should synthetically consider the 
      epidemic prevention situation of inhabitance, the disease stage and previous 
      therapeutic schedule to decide the next therapeutic schedule. If necessary, after 
      professional discussion and communication between doctors and patients online or 
      offline, the hospital visiting time should be delayed through seeking alternative 
      treatment schemes, and psychological counseling for patients should be paid 
      attention to at the same time.

AB  - The recently emerged 2019 Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and associated COVID-19 
      disease cause serious or even fatal respiratory tract infection and yet no approved 
      therapeutics or effective treatment is currently available to effectively combat the 
      outbreak. This urgent situation is pressing the world to respond with the 
      development of novel vaccine or a small molecule therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2. Along 
      these efforts, the structure of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) has been rapidly 
      resolved and made publicly available to facilitate global efforts to develop novel 
      drug candidates. Recently, our group has developed a novel deep learning platform - 
      Deep Docking (DD) which provides fast prediction of docking scores of Glide (or any 
      other docking program) and, hence, enables structure-based virtual screening of 
      billions of purchasable molecules in a short time. In the current study we applied 
      DD to all 1.3 billion compounds from ZINC15 library to identify top 1,000 potential 
      ligands for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protein. The compounds are made publicly available for 
      further characterization and development by scientific community.

AB  - Since December 2019, China has been experiencing an outbreak of a new infectious 
      disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The 
      clinical features include fever, coughing, shortness of breath, and inflammatory 
      lung infiltration. China rapidly listed SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia as a statutory

AB  - Objective: To explore the management strategies for patients with gynecological 
      malignant tumors during the outbreak and transmission of COVID19. Methods: We 
      retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics, treatment, and disease 
      outcomes of three patients with gynecological malignancies associated with COVID19 
      in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University in January 2020, and proposed management 
      strategies for patients with gynecological tumors under risk of COVID19. Results: 
      Three patients were treated COVID19 based on the national diagnosis and treatment 
      protocol as well as research progress. Meanwhile, these patients were appropriately 
      adjusted the treatment plan in accordance with the clinical guidelines for 
      gynecological tumors. Pneumonia was cured in 2 patients, and one patient died of 
      COVID-19. Conclusions: Patients with gynecological malignant tumors are high-risk 
      groups prone to COVID-19 infection, and gynecological oncologists need to carry out 
      education, prevention, control and treatment according to specific conditions. While 
      actively preventing and controlling COVID-19, the diagnosis and treatment of 
      gynecological malignant tumors should be carried out in an orderly and safe manner.

AB  - Since December 2019, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection has been prevalent 
      in China. Due to immaturity of immune function and the possibility of mother-fetal 
      vertical transmission, neonates are particularly susceptible to 2019-nCoV. The 
      perinatal-neonatal departments should cooperate closely and take integrated 
      approaches, and the neonatal intensive care unit should prepare the emergency plan 
      for 2019-nCoV infection as far as possible, so as to ensure the optimal management 
      and treatment of potential victims. According to the latest 2019-nCoV national 
      management plan and the actual situation, the Working Group for the Prevention and 
      Control of Neonatal 2019-nCoV Infection in the Perinatal Period of the Editorial 
      Committee of Chinese Journal of Contemporary Pediatrics puts forward recommendations 
      for the prevention and control of 2019-nCoV infection in neonates.

TI  - CT Manifestations of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia: A Case Report.
LID - 10.4274/balkanmedj.galenos.2020.2020.2.15 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since December 2019, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus has impacted 
      nearly >90,000 people in more than 75 countries. In this case report, we aim to 
      define the chest computed tomography findings of 2019-novel coronavirus associated 
      with pneumonia and its successful resolution after treatment. CASE REPORT: A 
      fifty-year-old female patient, who is a businesswoman, presented with chief 
      complaints of “fever for one week, diarrhea, anorexia, and asthenia.” Initially, she 
      was given Tamiflu. The influenza A virus serology was negative. Three days later, 
      levofloxacin was started because the patient’s symptoms did not improve. The novel 
      coronavirus nucleic acid test was negative. It was noted that before the onset of 
      the disease, the patient went to Wuhan on a business trip. Despite the given 
      treatment, her body temperature rose to 39.2°C and she was referred to our clinic 
      for further evaluation. Then, chest computed tomography was performed and showed 
      bilateral multifocal ground glass opacities with consolidation which suggested viral 
      pneumonia as a differential diagnosis, and the subsequent 2019-novel coronavirus 
      pneumonia nucleic acid test was positive. CONCLUSION: Chest computed tomography 
      offers fast and convenient evaluation of patients with suspected 2019-novel 
      coronavirus pneumonia.

TI  - Clinical Features of 69 Cases with Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Wuhan, China.
LID - ciaa272 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciaa272 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: From December 2019 to February 2020, 2019 severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a serious outbreak of coronavirus 
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China. Related clinical features are needed. 
      METHODS: We reviewed 69 patients who were hospitalized in Union hospital in Wuhan 
      between January 16 to January 29, 2020. All patients were confirmed to be infected 
      with SARS-CoV-2 and the final date of follow-up was February 4, 2020. RESULTS: The 
      median age of 69 enrolled patients was 42.0 years (IQR 35.0-62.0), and 32 patients 
      (46%) were men. The most common symptoms were fever (60[87%]), cough (38[55%]), and 
      fatigue (29[42%]). Most patients received antiviral therapy (66 [98.5%] of 67 
      patients) and antibiotic therapy (66 [98.5%] of 67 patients). As of February 4, 
      2020, 18 (26.9%) of 67 patients had been discharged, and five patients had died, 
      with a mortality rate of 7.5%. According to the lowest SpO2 during admission, cases 
      were divided into the SpO2≥90% group (n=55) and the SpO2<90% group (n=14). All 5 
      deaths occurred in the SpO2<90% group. Compared with SpO2≥90% group, patients of the 
      SpO2<90% group were older, and showed more comorbidities and higher plasma levels of 
      IL6, IL10, lactate dehydrogenase, and c reactive protein. Arbidol treatment showed 
      tendency to improve the discharging rate and decrease the mortality rate. 
      CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 appears to show frequent fever, dry cough, and increase of 
      inflammatory cytokines, and induced a mortality rate of 7.5%. Older patients or 
      those with underlying comorbidities are at higher risk of death.

TI  - Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus Infection Up-Regulates FcRn Expression via 
      Nucleocapsid Protein and Secretion of TGF-β in Porcine Intestinal Epithelial Cells.
PG  - 3085

AB  - Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a porcine intestinal coronavirus that 
      causes fatal severe watery diarrhea in piglets. The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is 
      the only IgG transport receptor, its expression on mucosal surfaces is triggered 
      upon viral stimulation, which significantly enhances mucosal immunity. We utilized 
      TGEV as a model pathogen to explore the role of FcRn in resisting viral invasion in 
      overall intestinal mucosal immunity. TGEV induced FcRn expression by activating 
      NF-κB signaling in porcine small intestinal epithelial (IPEC-J2) cells, however, the 
      underlying mechanisms are unclear. First, using small interfering RNAs, we found 
      that TGEV up-regulated FcRn expression via TLR3, TLR9 and RIG-I. Moreover, TGEV 
      induced IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TGF-β, and TNF-α production. TGF-β-stimulated IPEC-J2 
      cells highly up-regulated FcRn expression, while treatment with a JNK-specific 
      inhibitor down-regulated the expression. TGEV nucleocapsid (N) protein also enhanced 
      FcRn promoter activity via the NF-κB signaling pathway and its central region (aa 
      128-252) was essential for FcRn activation. Additionally, N protein-mediated FcRn 
      up-regulation promotes IgG transcytosis. Thus, TGEV N protein and TGF-β up-regulated 
      FcRn expression, further clarifying the molecular mechanism of up-regulation of FcRn 
      expression by TGEV.

AB  - Background As the number of patients increases, there is a growing understanding of 
      the form of pneumonia sustained by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which 
      has caused an outbreak in China. Up to now, clinical features and treatment of 
      patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported in detail. However, the 
      relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and coagulation has been scarcely addressed. Our aim 
      is to investigate the blood coagulation function of patients with SARS-CoV-2 
      infection. Methods In our study, 94 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      were admitted in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. We prospectively collect blood 
      coagulation data in these patients and in 40 healthy controls during the same 
      period. Results Antithrombin values in patients were lower than that in the control 
      group (p < 0.001). The values of D-dimer, fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products 
      (FDP), and fibrinogen (FIB) in all SARS-CoV-2 cases were substantially higher than 
      those in healthy controls. Moreover, D-dimer and FDP values in patients with severe 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection were higher than those in patients with milder forms. Compared 
      with healthy controls, prothrombin time activity (PT-act) was lower in SARS-CoV-2 
      patients. Thrombin time in critical SARS-CoV-2 patients was also shorter than that 
      in controls. Conclusions The coagulation function in patients with SARS-CoV-2 is 
      significantly deranged compared with healthy people, but monitoring D-dimer and FDP 
      values may be helpful for the early identification of severe cases.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the clinical characteristics of cases of novel coronavirus 
      pneumonia and a preliminary study to explore the relationship between different 
      clinical classification and liver damage. Methods: Consecutively confirmed novel 
      coronavirus infection cases admitted to seven designated hospitals during January 
      23, 2020 to February 8, 2020 were included. Clinical classification (mild, moderate, 
      severe, and critical) was carried out according to the diagnosis and treatment 
      program of novel coronavirus pneumonia (Trial Fifth Edition) issued by the National 
      Health Commission. The research data were analyzed using SPSS19.0 statistical 
      software. Quantitative data were expressed as median (interquartile range), and 
      qualitative data were expressed as frequency and rate. Results: 32 confirmed cases 
      that met the inclusion criteria were included. 28 cases were of mild or moderate 
      type (87.50%), and four cases (12.50%) of severe or critical type. Four cases 
      (12.5%) were combined with one underlying disease (bronchial asthma, coronary heart 
      disease, malignant tumor, chronic kidney disease), and one case (3.13%) was 
      simultaneously combined with high blood pressure and malignant tumor. The results of 
      laboratory examination showed that the alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate 
      aminotransferase (AST), albumin (ALB), and total bilirubin (TBil) for entire cohort 
      were 26.98 (16.88 ~ 46.09) U/L and 24.75 (18.71 ~ 31.79) U/L, 39.00 (36.20 ~ 44.20) 
      g/L and 16.40 (11.34- ~ 21.15) mmol/L, respectively. ALT, AST, ALB and TBil of the 
      mild or moderate subgroups were 22.75 (16.31- ~ 37.25) U/L, 23.63 (18.71 ~ 26.50) 
      U/L, 39.70 (36.50 ~ 46.10) g/L, and 15.95 (11.34 ~ 20.83) mmol/L, respectively. ALT, 
      AST, ALB and TBil of the severe or critical subgroups were 60.25 (40.88 ~ 68.90) 
      U/L, 37.00 (20.88 ~ 64.45) U/L, 35.75 (28.68 ~ 42.00) g/L, and 20.50 (11.28 ~ 25.00) 
      mmol/L, respectively. Conclusion: The results of this multicenter retrospective 
      study suggests that novel coronavirus pneumonia combined with liver damage is more 
      likely to be caused by adverse drug reactions and systemic inflammation in severe 
      patients receiving medical treatment. Therefore, liver function monitoring and 
      evaluation should be strengthened during the treatment of such patients.

AB  - Health professions preventing and controlling Coronavirus Disease 2019 are prone to 
      skin and mucous membrane injury, which may cause acute and chronic dermatitis, 
      secondary infection and aggravation of underlying skin diseases. This is a consensus 
      of Chinese experts on protective measures and advice on hand-cleaning- and 
      medical-glove-related hand protection, mask- and goggles-related face protection, 
      UV-related protection, eye protection, nasal and oral mucosa protection, outer ear 
      and hair protection. It is necessary to strictly follow standards of wearing 
      protective equipment and specification of sterilizing and cleaning. Insufficient and 
      excessive protection will have adverse effects on the skin and mucous membrane 
      barrier. At the same time, using moisturizing products is highly recommended to 
      achieve better protection. This article is protected by copyright. All rights
