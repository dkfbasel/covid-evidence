The follow up period is 15 days.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nAs the newest global medical emergency, the COVID-19 (diagnosed SARS-CoV2 infection with lung involvement) exhibits features that are unlikely ameliorated by antivirals-based approaches alone. First, although the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infect lung and intestine, many patients suddenly take a turn for the worse even when the viral replication appears to be under control. Second, patients with serious or critical clinical symptoms show remarked T cell lymphopenia that are more severe and more acute than human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Functional exhaustion of T cells is suggested by high expression of T-cell exhaustion markers, which again appears more acute than in HIV patients. Third, multiple cytokines are elevated among patients with severe clinical symptoms, which potentially explains the multiple organ failure associated with COVID-19. For these reasons, treatment of COVID-19 likely requires a combination of both antivirals and non-antivirals-based approaches. CD24Fc is a biological immunomodulator in Phase II/III clinical trial stage. CD24Fc comprises the nonpolymorphic regions of CD24 attached to the Fc region of human IgG1. We have shown that CD24 is an innate checkpoint against the inflammatory response to tissue injuries or danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that CD24Fc effectively address the major challenges associated with COVID-19. First, a Phase I clinical trial on healthy volunteers not only demonstrated safety of CD24Fc, but also demonstrated its biological activity in suppressing expression of multiple inflammatory cytokines. Second, in Phase II clinical trial in leukemia patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT), three doses of CD24Fc effectively eliminated severe (Grade 3-4) acute graft vs host diseases (GVHD), which is caused by over reacting immune system and transplanted T cells attacking recipient target tissues. Third, in preclinical models of HIV/SIV infections, we have shown that CD24Fc ameliorated production of multiple inflammatory cytokines, reversed the loss of T lymphocytes as well as functional T cell exhaustion and reduced the leukocyte infiltration of multiple organs. It is particularly noteworthy that CD24Fc reduced the rate of pneumonia in SIV-infected Chinese rhesus monkey from 83% to 33%. Therefore, CD24Fc maybe a prime candidate for non-antiviral biological modifier for COVID-19 therapy. The phase III trial will involve 230 patients randomized into blinded placebo and CD24Fc arms, with time to clinical improvement from severe to mild symptom as the primary endpoint.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04317040","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

The novel coronavirus attacks the human body by attaching to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), a protective enzyme against lung damage. In addition, the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 for HCoV-19 Spike protein priming is also essential for the host cell entry and spread. Coronaviruses can be deadly, in large part because they cause \"cytokine storms.\" These storms result from imbalances between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory proteins called cytokines, which can cause extreme inflammation and respiratory complications. Respiratory distress kills hundreds of thousands of people each year worldwide, and hundreds of clinical trials are testing drugs to treat it. MSCs have been widely used in cell-based therapy, from basic research to clinical trials Safety and effectiveness have been clearly documented in many clinical trials, especially in the immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.

Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to standard of care or standard of care with the addition of therapy with chloroquine.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nChloroquine is one of two therapeutics (in addition to remdesivir) that has demonstrated in vitro inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2 and the drug is immediately available from national pharmacies. No delay is accordingly expected in treatment initiation after study commencement. In light of the evidence supporting chloroquine as a promising therapeutic in patients with COVID-19, the expected impact of the current proposal is considerable both in the short- and long-term. If successful, treatment with chloroquine has the potential to be the first evidence based treatment for COVID-19. The drug is affordable and the risk of side effects is low, making it an attractive therapeutic in large proportions of the population on a global scale. In the current proposal aims to investigate the virological and clinical effects of chloroquine treatment in patients with established SARS-CoV-2 in need of hospital admission. The investigators hypothesize that early treatment with chloroquine in patients with established COVID-19 is safe and will significantly improve prognosis and impact clinical outcomes. More specifically, the investigators hypothesize that early treatment with chloroquine will increase the virological clearance rate of SARS-CoV-2, and lead to more rapid resolve of clinical symptoms, decreased proportion of patients with clinical deterioration and a decreased admission rate to intensive care units and in-hospital mortality. Considering the immediate and worldwide health emergency associated with the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and the current lack of evidence based medical interventions for this patient group, studies investigating such possible treatment modalities in COVID-19 are direly needed. The study is a two-arm, open label, pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to assess the virological and clinical effect of chloroquine therapy in patients with established COVID-19. Pragmatic clinical trials are characterized by focus on informing decision-makers on optimal clinical medicine practice and an intent to streamline procedures and data collection in the trial. By utilizing resources already paid for by the hospitals (physicians and nurses in daily clinical practice), pragmatic clinical trials can include a larger number of patients at a short time duration and at a lower cost. Due to the immediate need for study commencement and the time frame of the current proposal, a pragmatic approach will enable swift initiation of randomization and treatment. Data will be extracted from the data warehouse at Akershus University Hospital for eligible patient identification (i.e. electronic surveillance) and for automatic data extraction to the study specific database. The study will not be able to procure an acceptable placebo treatment and the study will accordingly not be placebo-controlled. All patients at Akershus University Hospital with suspicion of acute respiratory tract infections are examined with a nasopharyngeal swab, with subsequent microbiological examination, including SARS-CoV-2 specific RT-PCR. Participants will be recruited from the entirety of the inpatients at the participating hospitals. Electronic real-time surveillance of laboratory reports from the Department of Microbiology will be examined regularly, with maximum interval 24 hours, for SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects. The study aims to include patients by a sequential adaptive approach, where analyses are planned after the inclusion of 51 patients, with subsequent analyses after 101, 151 and 202 completed patients. All patients included in each sequence will be used for the final analyses of the entire study. This approach will enable frequent assessment of all outcome measures. Data will be collected from the hospital electronic record system, including electronic patient records, laboratory and medical imaging systems, and prescribing systems. The data warehouse at Akershus University Hospital will be utilized for automatic data extraction to the study specific database. All clinical variables will be registered in the study eCRF system, including clinical endpoints and quantitative virological results from serial nasopharyngeal specimens.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04316377","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

No proven vaccine is available to protect healthcare workers against SARS-CoV-2. This study will enroll 260 healthcare professionals dedicated to care for patients with proven SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subjects will be randomized either in the observational (control) group or in the inhaled nitric oxide group. All personnel will observe measures on strict precaution in accordance with WHO and the CDC regulations.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nIn their efforts to provide care for patients with novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) infection, many healthcare workers around the globe exposed to SARS-CoV-2 got infected and died over the past two months. Quarantined nurses and physicians have become the norm in regions with COVID-19 patients, putting at risk the overall functionality of the regional healthcare system. Other than strict contact-precautions, no proven vaccination or targeted therapy is available to prevent COVID-19 in healthcare workers. Inhaled nitric oxide gas (NO) has shown in a small clinical study to have antiviral activity against a Coronavirus during the 2003 SARS outbreak. We have designed this study to assess whether intermittent inhaled NO in healthcare workers might prevent their infection with SARS-CoV-2. Background: After almost two months of fight against COVID-19 infection, on February 24, more than 3,000 physicians and nurses were reported as contracting COVID-19 disease in Wuhan (China). Fatalities among those healthcare workers were reported to be related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Implementation of strict contact protections for all healthcare personnel is essential to decrease and contain the risks of exposure. However, despite best efforts, dozens of thousands of healthcare providers have been quarantined for at least 14 consecutive days in Wuhan alone. Similarly data have been reported in Italy, several healthcare providers have been quarantined, developed pneumonia and died. Most recent information from Italy reported that 12% of healthcare workers are infected. The shortage of hospital personnel, especially in the critical care and anesthesiology domains, led many hospitals to postpone indefinitely scheduled surgical procedures, including cardiac surgery or oncological procedures. Only urgent and emergent cases are performed in patients without symptoms (i.e., absence of fever, cough or dyspnea), no signs (i.e., negative chest CT for consolidations, normal complete blood count) and a negative test on SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase (rt)-PCR. If time does not allow for thorough screening (i.e., after traumatic injury), such patients are considered to be infected and medical staff in the OR are fully protected with third degree protections (i.e., N95 masks, goggles, protective garments and a gown and double gloving). Rationale. In 2004 in a collaborative study between the virology laboratory at the University of Leuven (Belgium), the Clinical Physiology Laboratory of Uppsala University (Sweden) and the General Airforce Hospital of China (Beijing, China), nitric oxide (NO) donors (e.g. S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine) greatly increased the survival rate of infected eukaryotic cells with the coronavirus responsible for SARS (SARS-CoV-1), suggesting direct antiviral effects of NO. These authors suggest that oxidation is the antiviral mechanism of nitric oxide. A later work by Akerstrom and colleagues showed that NO or its derivatives reduce palmitoylation SARS-CoV spike (S) protein affecting its fusion with angiotensin converting enzyme 2. Furthermore, NO or its derivatives reduce viral RNA synthesis in the infected cells. Future in-vitro studies should confirm that NO donors are equally effective against SARS-CoV-2, as the current virus shares 88% of its genome with the SARS-CoV [3]. However, at present it is reasonable to assess that a high dose of inhaled NO might be anti-viral against SARS-CoV-2 in the lung. The virus is transmitted by human-to-human contact and occurs primarily via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes within a range of about 1.5 meters. The incubation period ranges from 1 to 14 days with an estimated median incubation period of 5 to 6 days according to the World Health Organization [1]. COVID-19 disease is mainly a respiratory system disease, but in the most severe forms can progress to impair also other organ function (i.e., kidneys, liver, heart). Nitric oxide gas inhalation has been successfully and safely used for decades (since 1990) in thousands of newborns and adults to decrease pulmonary artery pressure and improve systemic oxygenation. Recently at the Massachusetts General Hospital, a high dose of inhaled NO (160 ppm) for 30 - 60 minutes was delivered twice a day to an adolescent with cystic fibrosis and pulmonary infection due to multi-resistant Burkholderia cepacia. There were no adverse events to this patient, blood methemoglobin remained below 5% and lung function and overall well-being improved. Clinical Gap. Thousands of healthcare workers have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and contracted COVID-19 despite their best efforts to prevent contamination. No proven vaccine is available to protect healthcare workers against SARS-CoV-2. Hypothesis. Due to genetic similarities with the Coronavirus responsible for SARS, it is expected that inhaled NO gas retains potent antiviral activity against the SARS-CoV-2 responsible for COVID-19. Aim. To assess whether intermittent delivery of inhaled NO gas in air at a high dose may protect healthcare workers from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Observational group: a SARS-CoV-2 rt-PCR will be performed once a week. Treatment group: the subjects will breathe NO at 160 parts per million (ppm) for two cycles of 15 minutes each at the beginning of each shift and before leaving the hospital. A SARS-CoV-2 rt-PCR will be performed once a week. Safety: Oxygenation and methemoglobin levels will be monitored via a non-invasive CO-oximeter. If methemoglobin levels rise above 5% at any point of the gas delivery, inhaled NO will be stopped. NO2 gas will be monitored and maintained below 5 ppm. Blinding. The treatment is not masked.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04312243","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

At present, there are no proven interventions to prevent progression of the disease. Some preliminary data on SARS pneumonia suggest that inhaled Nitric Oxide (NO) could have beneficial effects on SARS-CoV-2 due to the genomic similarities between this two coronaviruses. In this study we will test whether inhaled NO therapy prevents progression in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 disease.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nTo date, no targeted therapeutic treatments for the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak have been identified. Antiviral combined with adjuvant therapies are currently under investigation. The clinical spectrum of the infection is wide, ranging from mild signs of upper respiratory tract infection to severe pneumonia and death. In the patients who progress, the time period from symptoms onset to development of dyspnea is reported to be between 5 to 10 days, and that one to severe respiratory distress syndrome from 10 to 14 days. Globally, 15 to 18% of patients deteriorates to the need of mechanical ventilation, despite the use of non-invasive ventilatory support in the earliest phases of the disease. Probability of progression to end stage disease is unpredictable, with the majority of these patients dying from multi-organ failure. Preventing progression in spontaneously breathing patients with mild to moderate disease would translate in improved morbidity and mortality and in a lower use of limited healthcare resources. In 2004, during the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak, a pilot study showed that low dose ( max 30 ppm) inhaled NO for 3 days was able to shorten the time of ventilatory support. At the same time, NO donor compound S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine increased survival rate in an in-vitro model of SARS-CoV infected epithelial cells.Based on the genetic similarities between the two viruses, similar effects of NO on SARS-CoV-2 can be hypothesized. While further in-vitro testing is recommended, we proposed a randomized clinical trial to test the effectiveness of inhaled NO in preventing the progression of SARS-CoV-2 related disease, when administered at an early stage.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04305457","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

Its as effective as lopinavir/ritonavir for the treatment of HIV/AIDS and better tolerated because the adverse effects rate is lower (diarrhea 2% vs 27%). Another promising drug is chloroquine, that showed excellent in vitro results and strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV infection of primate cells.

Some patients rapidly progressed and suffered severe acute respiratory failure and died, making it imperative to develop a safe and effective vaccine to treat and prevent severe Covid-19 pneumonia. Based on detailed analysis of the viral genome and search for potential immunogenic targets, a synthetic minigene has been engineered based on conserved domains of the viral structural proteins and a polyprotein protease. The infection of Covid-19 is mediated through binding of the Spike protein to the ACEII receptor, and the viral replication depends on molecular mechanisms of all of these viral proteins. This trial proposes to develop universal vaccine and test innovative Covid-19 minigenes engineered based on multiple viral genes, using an efficient lentiviral vector system (NHP/TYF) to express viral proteins and immune modulatory genes to modify artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPC) and to activate T cells. In this study, the safety and immune reactivity of this aAPC vaccine will be investigated.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nBackground: The 2019 discovered new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is an enveloped positive strand single strand RNA virus. The number of SARS-CoV-2 infected people has increased rapidly and WHO has warned that the pandemic spread of Covid-19 is imminent and would have disastrous outcomes. Covid-19 could pose a serious threat to human health and the global economy. There is no vaccine available or clinically approved antiviral therapy as yet. This study aims to evaluate the safety and immune reactivity of a genetically modified aAPC universal vaccine to treat and prevent Covid-19. Objective: Primary study objectives: Injection of Covid-19/aAPC vaccine to volunteers to evaluate the safety. Secondary study objectives: To evaluate the anti- Covid-19 reactivity of the Covid-19/aAPC vaccine. Design: 1. Based on the genomic sequence of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, select conserved and critical structural and protease protein domains to engineer lentiviral minigenes to express SARS-CoV-2 antigens. 2. The Covid-19/aAPC vaccine is prepared by applying lentivirus modification including immune modulatory genes and the viral minigenes, to the artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPCs). The Covid-19/aAPCs are then inactivated for proliferation and extensively safety tested. 3. The subjects receive a total of 5x10^ 6 cells each time by subcutaneous injection at 0, 14 and 28 days.

SARS-CoV-2 is a RNA virus that display high similarity in both genomic and proteomic profiling with SARS-CoV that first emerged in humans in 2003 in China. Therefore, preventing and controlling the pandemic occurrences are extremely urgent as a global top priority. Due to the lack of effective antiviral drugs, patients may be treated by only addressing their symptoms such as reducing fever. Clinical autopsies from SARS-CoV-infected patients demonstrated that there were major pathological changes in the lungs, immune organs, and small systemic blood vessels with vasculitis. However, the detection of SARS-CoV were primarily found in the lung and trachea/bronchus, but was undetectable in spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow, heart and aorta, highlighting the overreaction of immune responses induced by viral infection were really harmful, resulting in the pathogenesis of lungs, immune organs, and small systemic blood vessels. To this respect, immune modulation strategy may be potentially beneficial to enhance anti-viral immunity and efficiently reduce the viral load, improve clinical outcomes, expedite the patient recovery, and decline the rate of mortality in patients after being infected with SARS-CoV-2. Tianhe Stem Cell Biotechnologies Inc. has developed a novel globally-patented Stem Cell Educator (SCE) technology designed to reverse the autoimmune response in Type 1 diabetes (T1D), Alopecia Areata (AA) and other autoimmune diseases. SCE therapy uses human multipotent cord blood stem cells (CB-SC) from human cord blood. Their properties distinguish CB-SC from other known stem cell types, including mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Several clinical studies show that SCE therapy functions via CB-SC induction of immune tolerance in autoimmune T cells and restore immune balance and homeostasis in patients with T1D, AA and other inflammation-associated diseases. To correct the overreaction of overreaction of immune responses, the investigators plan to treat SARS-CoV-2 patients with Stem Cell Educator therapy.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nThis is a prospective, two-arm, partially masked, single center clinical study to assess the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of SCE therapy for the treatment of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

It is mainly characterized by fever, dry cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Some patients may develop into rapid and deadly respiratory system injury with overwhelming inflammation in the lung. Currently, there is no effective treatment in clinical practice. The present clinical trial is to explore the safety and efficacy of Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells (UC-MSCs) therapy for novel coronavirus pneumonia patients.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nSince late December 2019, human pneumonia cases infected by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) were firstly identified in Wuhan, China. As the virus is contagious and of great epidemic, more and more cases have found in other areas of China and abroad. Up to February 24, a total of 77, 779 confirmed cases were reported in China. At present, there is no effective treatment for patients identified with novel coronavirus pneumonia. Therefore, it's urgent to explore more active therapeutic methods to cure the patients. Recently, some clinical researches about the 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia published in The Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine suggested that massive inflammatory cell infiltration and inflammatory cytokines secretion were found in patients' lungs, alveolar epithelial cells and capillary endothelial cells were damaged, causing acute lung injury. It seems that the key to cure the pneumonia is to inhibit the inflammatory response, resulting to reduce the damage of alveolar epithelial cells and endothelial cells and repair the function of the lung. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are widely used in basic research and clinical application. They are proved to migrate to damaged tissues, exert anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory functions, promote the regeneration of damaged tissues and inhibit tissue fibrosis. Studies have shown that MSCs can significantly reduce acute lung injury in mice caused by H9N2 and H5N1 viruses by reducing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the lungs. Compared with MSCs from other sources, human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) have been widely applied to various diseases due to their convenient collection, no ethical controversy, low immunogenicity, and rapid proliferation rate. In our recent research, we confirmed that UC-MSCs can significantly reduce inflammatory cell infiltration and inflammatory factors expression in lung tissue, and significantly protect lung tissue from endotoxin (LPS) -induced acute lung injury in mice. The purpose of this clinical study is to investigate safety and efficiency of UC-MSCs in treating pneumonia patients infected by 2019-nCoV. The investigators planned to recruit 48 patients aged from 18 to 75 years old and had no severe underlying diseases. In the cell treatment group, 24 patients received 0.5*10E6 UC-MSCs /kg body weight intravenously treatment 4 times every other day besides conventional treatment. In the control group, other 24 patients received conventional treatment plus 4 times of placebo intravenously. The lung CT, blood biochemical examination, lymphocyte subsets, inflammatory factors, 28-days mortality, etc will be evaluated within 24h and 1, 2, 4, 8 weeks after UC-MSCs treatment.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04293692","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

At present, there are no proven interventions to prevent progression of the disease. Some preliminary data on SARS pneumonia suggest that inhaled Nitric Oxide (NO) could have beneficial effects on COVID-19 due to the genomic similarities between this two coronaviruses. In this study we will test whether inhaled NO therapy prevents progression in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 disease.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nTo date, no targeted therapeutic treatments for the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak have been identified. Antiviral combined with adjuvant therapies are currently under investigation. The clinical spectrum of the infection is wide, ranging from mild signs of upper respiratory tract infection to severe pneumonia and death. In the patients who progress, the time period from symptoms onset to development of dyspnea is reported to be between 5 to 10 days, and that one to severe respiratory distress syndrome from 10 to 14 days. Globally, 15 to 18% of patients deteriorates to the need of mechanical ventilation, despite the use of non-invasive ventilatory support in the earliest phases of the disease. Probability of progress to end stage disease is unpredictable, with the majority of these patients dying from multi-organ failure. Preventing progression in spontaneously breathing patients with mild to moderate disease would translate in improved morbility and mortality and in a lower use of limited healthcare resources. In 2004, during the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak, a pilot study showed that low dose ( max 30 ppm) inhaled NO for 3 days was able to shorten the time of ventilatory support. At the same time, NO donor compound S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine increased survival rate in an in-vitro model of SARS-CoV infected eukaryotic cells.Based on the genetic similarities between the two viruses, similar effects of NO on COVID-19 can be hypothesized. While further in-vitro testing is recommended, we proposed a randomized clinical trial to test the effectiveness of inhaled NO in preventing the progression of COVID-19 related disease, when administered at an early stage.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04290858","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

In these models, Aviptadil restores barrier function at the endothelial/alveolar interface and thereby protects the lung and other organs from failure. Aviptadil is approved for human use in Europe and has a demonstrated 20 year history of safety in numerous trials for Sarcoid, Pulmonary Fibrosis, Bronchospasm, Erectile Dysfunction, and a phase I trial in ARDS. Five phase 2 trials have been conducted under European regulatory authority. Numerous healthy volunteer studies have shown that i.v. infusion of Aviptadil is well tolerated with few adverse effects including alterations in blood pressure, heart rate, or ECG. In addition to published studies of human use, Aviptadil has been used on a compounded basis in certain ICUs for many years in the belief that it preserves life and restores function in pulmonary hypertension, ARDS, and Acute Lung Injury (ALI). In this study, patients who are hospitalized and intubated for ARDS secondary to COVID-19 infection will be randomly allocated to Aviptadil administered by intravenous infusion, nebulization via the endotracheal tube, and both IV and endotracheal administration. Primary endpoints will be improvement in blood oxygenation and mortality.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04311697","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

COVID-19 caused clusters of severe respiratory illness and was associated with 2% mortality. There is currently no vaccine and no specific antiviral treatment recommended for COVID-19. About 20% of the patients were severe and the mainstay of clinical management is largely symptomatic treatment, with organ support in intensive care for seriously ill patients. Therefore, it is urgent to find a safe and effective therapeutic approach to COVID-19. In the last years, the promising features of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), including their regenerative properties and ability to differentiate into diverse cell lineages, have generated great interest among researchers whose work has offered intriguing perspectives on cell-based therapies for various diseases. These findings seem to highlight that the beneficial effect of MSC-based treatment could be principally due by the immunomodulation and regenerative potential of these cells. MSCs could significantly reduce the pathological changes of lung and inhibit the cell-mediated immune inflammatory response induced by influenza virus in animal model . MSCs has been shown to reduce nonproductive inflammation and affect tissue regeneration and is being evaluated in patients with ARDS. Our phase I preliminary data of parallel assignment study(NCT04252118) showed that three doses of MSCs was safe in patients with COVID-19. Randomized control trial are needed to assess efficacy and safety. The investigators will do a prospective, double-blind, multicentre, randomised trial to assess treatment with three intravenous doses of MSCs compared with placebo. 90 severe COVID-19 patients will be recruited in China. 60 patients receive i.v. transfusion 3 times of MSCs（ 4.0*10E7 cells per time), as the treated group, all of them receive the conventional treatment.

This protocol only describes the basic statistical analysis content, and the actual content shall be subject to the statistical analysis plan. 2.1Analysis data set 2.1.1Full Analysis Set (FAS): a set of all cases randomized to use the study drug at least once. 2.1.2Per Protocol Set (PPS): a data set generated by subjects who have fully complied with the trial protocol, including treatment received, availability of primary endpoint measurement, and no significant violation of the trial protocol. Cases withdrawn due to inefficacy will also be included in PPS. PPS will be subject to the final classification of the data audit report. 2.1.3Safety Set (SS): a set of subjects who receive at least one treatment with a safety evaluation after randomization. 2.2Missing data processing method 2.2.1The subjects who have missing primary efficiency indicators are filled in according to the treatment failure, that is, the pathogen nucleic acid testing in throat swabs, urine and stool on Days 7-14 after administration does not convert to negative. Unless otherwise specified, the secondary efficiency indicators shall be included as observed data in the statistical analysis, and the missing data shall not be filled in. 2.2.2The safety data shall not be filled in. 2.3Statistical method 2.3.1General principle Description of statistics: The primary indicators collected in this study are described with statistical method. Quantitative indicators are described by means of mean, standard deviation, median, quartile, maximum, minimum and the like; qualitative indicators are described by frequency, percentage and the like. Statistical test: Unless otherwise specified, the statistical significance level is 0.05 by two-sided test (one-sided 0.025) and the 95% confidence interval shall be provided for the estimation of inter-group variance parameters. 2.3.2Characteristics of cases Subject distribution The population and the number of enrolled and completed cases in each center are listed, and three analysis data sets (FAS, PPS, SS) are determined. A detailed list of the data set categories is made. The number and ratio of subjects who are randomly enrolled, complete the trial, and withdraw from the trial early and the reasons are calculated. The subject distribution flow chart is plotted. General information and baseline characteristics The demographic information, previous medication history and history of other diseases of the patients are described with statistical method. General information and baseline characteristics are described based on FAS. 2.3.3Analysis of drug exposure and drug combination Analysis based on SS. The drug exposure, dose intensity and exposure time of each group are calculated and subject to descriptive statistical analysis. The drug combination is coded by WHO ATC and summarized according to the ATC secondary classification and PT. The number and ratio of cases are calculated. 2.3.4Efficiency analysis Analysis based on FAS and PPS. Primary efficiency indicators: The primary effective indicators are complete antipyresis time, pulmonary imaging improvement indicators, and negative conversion ratio of pathogen nucleic acid testing in throat swabs, urine and stool on Days 7-14 after administration.The non-inferiority evaluation is based on FAS. The statistical significance level is set to one-sided 0.025 and the non-inferiority critical value is set to -10%. The negative conversion ratio of pathogen nucleic acid testing in throat swabs, urine and stool on Days 7-14 after administration in the trial group and positive control group is calculated respectively. The negative conversion ratio difference (trial group - control group) between the trial group and positive control group as well as the two-sided 95% confidence interval (95%CI) are calculated. The confidence interval is estimated by Miettinen-Nurminen. If the lower limit of 95% confidence interval for the negative conversion ratio difference between the trial group and control group is greater than -10%, it is considered that the trial drug for the indication is not inferior to the positive control drug. Given that the non-inferiority hypothesis is true, if it is further obtained that the lower limit of 95% confidence interval for the negative conversion ratio difference between the trial group and control group is greater than 0, it is considered that the trial drug for the indication is superior to the positive control drug. The inter-group ratio difference and confidence interval estimation results after the site effect control will be provided simultaneously as the sensitivity analysis and the sites with few subjects may be combined before analysis. Secondary efficiency indicators: The secondary efficiency indicators include negative conversion ratio of pathogen nucleic acid testing on Day 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14 after administration, negative conversion time, immune-related indicators (lymphocyte count, lymphocyte percentage, counts and percentages of CD4 and CD8), SOFA score, white blood cell count and C-reactive protein. The secondary efficiency indicators are subject to descriptive statistical analysis according to the data type.

The primary efficacy parameters include the time to oxygen saturation recovery to normal level (≥97%), the proportion of patients with normal level of oxygen saturation after treatment, and the total duration of oxygen inhalation, oxygen flow change by time, oxygen concentration change by time during treatment.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nThe breakout of a new type of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) begun in Wuhan of Hubei province in China in December 2019, and as a result of its rapid spreading nationwide, as of February 16, 2020, a large number of people up to 68,500 totally in China were diagnosed with a new type of disease of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 1665 peoples were died due to this disease in China. Based on the recent epidemiological investigation, the incubation period of this new coronavirus is 1-14 days and 3-7 days for most people before they show any symptom, such as fever, fatigue and dry cough that are the main clinical symptoms a few patients will also show nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat and diarrhea and other symptoms. Severe patients often have dyspnea and/or hypoxemia 1 week after onset of the disease, and the rapid progression for these patients include acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, refractory metabolic acidosis and coagulation dysfunction. According to the \"Guidance of Diagnosis and Treatment for Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Procedural Version 5 Amendment)\" recently issued by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, the general treatment will include close monitoring vital signs and oxygen saturation at finger, additionally, monitoring routine blood test, routine urine test, coagulation function, arterial blood gas analysis based on individual condition, and providing effective oxygen inhalation treatment (including nasal catheter, mask oxygen supply and transnasal high flow oxygen therapy) in time. T89 have the effects of activating blood circulation and removing blood stasis, regulating Qi and relieving pain. Four clinical trials conducted in China and abroad have shown that T89 can effectively alleviate the clinical symptoms of acute high altitude reaction, improve blood oxygen saturation, significantly increase the exercise time in treadmill and metabolic equivalents of task and enhance exercise tolerance under hypoxic environment. Modern pharmacological and gene network-based studies have shown that T89 can improve the oxygen carrying capacity of red blood cells, increase oxygen saturation, effectively reduce the injury of major organs such as heart, brain, lung and kidney caused by hypoxia, and prevent the decrease of oxygen saturation by improving the energy metabolism disorder caused by hypoxia. At the same time, T89 can inhibit the reduction of hematocrit, albumin leakage, neutrophil CD18 and adhesion factor of endothelial cells (ICAM-1), by which T89 has a good therapeutic effect on microcirculation disorders caused by many diseases. In conclusion, T89 can improve the ability of carrying oxygen of red blood cells, increase the oxygen saturation, effectively reduce the injury of heart, brain, lung and kidney and other major organs caused by hypoxia, and it can significantly improve the microcirculation disorder. At the same time, in the \"Guidance for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Atypical Pneumonia (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromes, SARS) P (2003 edition)\" has also recommended T89 can be used as a traditional Chinese patent medicine to treat patients of advanced stage and severe SARS lung asthma syndrome by its effect of promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis. In conclusion, T89 can improve the oxygen saturation and the clinical symptoms of patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), as a result, there may be some benefits for these patients to use T89 in current clinical treatment. This exploratory treatment clinical study is to investigate the effect of T89 on improving oxygen saturation and clinical symptoms in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), with the study design characterized by open-label, randomized and blank-control. In this study, an estimated total of 120-240 male and female patients aged 18-85 years old who have been diagnosed with coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), not including critical type in severity, will be enrolled and randomly assigned to one of two study groups, the T89 treatment group and the blank control group, to receive T89 or nothing for up to 14 days on the base of a standard treatment recommended by the\"Guidance of Diagnosis and Treatment for Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Procedural Version 5 Amendment) .

Some patients rapidly progressed and suffered severe acute respiratory failure and died, making it imperative to develop a safe and effective vaccine to treat and prevent severe Covid-19 pneumonia. Based on detailed analysis of the viral genome and search for potential immunogenic targets, a synthetic minigene has been engineered based on conserved domains of the viral structural proteins and a polyprotein protease. The infection of Covid-19 is mediated through binding of the Spike protein to the ACEII receptor, and the viral replication depends on molecular mechanisms of all of these viral proteins. This trial proposes to develop and test innovative Covid-19 minigenes engineered based on multiple viral genes, using an efficient lentiviral vector system (NHP/TYF) to express viral proteins and immune modulatory genes to modify dendritic cells (DCs) and to activate T cells. In this study, the safety and efficacy of this LV vaccine (LV-SMENP) will be investigated.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nBackground: The 2019 discovered new coronavirus, Covid-19, is an enveloped positive strand single strand RNA virus. The number of Covid-19 infected people has increased rapidly and WHO has warned that the spread of Covid-19 may soon become pandemic and have disastrous outcomes. Covid-19 could pose a serious threat to human health and global economy. There is no vaccine available or clinically approved antiviral therapy as yet. This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of treating Covid-19 infections with a novel lentiviral based DC and T cell vaccines. Objective: Primary study objectives: Injection and infusion of LV-SMENP DC and antigen-specific cytotoxic T cell vaccines to healthy volunteers and Covid-19 infected patients to evaluate the safety. Secondary study objectives: To evaluate the anti- Covid-19 efficacy of the LV-SMENP DC and antigen-specific cytotoxic T cell vaccines. Design: 1. Based on the genomic sequence of the new coronavirus Covid-19, select conserved and critical structural and protease protein domains to engineer lentiviral SMENP minigenes to express Covid-19 antigens. 2. LV-SMENP-DC vaccine is made by modifying DC with lentivirus vectors expressing Covid-19 minigene SMENP and immune modulatory genes.

Studies show that in 2017, the number of sepsis patients worldwide reached as high as 48.9 million, of which eleven million patients died. Studies in China also showed that more than one million patients died of sepsis in 2015. Therefore, how to effectively reduce the mortality of patients with sepsis has become a focus of clinical and basic research. Previous studies have suggested that sepsis are often secondary to excessive inflammatory response syndrome. However, treatment measures targeting excessive inflammatory response failed to effectively improve the prognosis of patients. The reason is that sepsis-related immune dysfunction can increase the risk of secondary infection and even affect the fatality rate. The immune checkpoint pathway is the endogenous component of the immune system, which is responsible for checking the immune response and keeping it in a normal physiological state. Tumor cells can evade host recognition through this pathway. One of these immunocheckpoint pathways is the PD-1 and PD-L1 pathways. PD-1 is a receptor expressed on the surface of T cells and ACTS as a negative regulator of T cell function. Monoclonal antibody blocking the activity of PD-1 can successfully reduce tumor load and has been widely used in the clinical treatment of various tumors. The immune imbalance in patients with sepsis has many similarities tumors. PD-1 and PD-L1 are key mediators in T cell depletion in sepsis patients. Animal models have shown that blocking PD-1 or PD-L1 can prevent T cell death, regulate cytokine production, reduce organ dysfunction and reduce death in sepsis. Previous study showed the clinical safety of anti-PD-1 antibody in sepsis patients through randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Thymosin has also been proved to regulate cellular immunity in sepsis patients. Some studies have shown that thymosin can significantly reduce the mortality of sepsis patients. At present, phase III clinical research is in progress to further clarify the role of thymosin in patients with sepsis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of PD-1 and thymosin in patients with severe pneumonia associated with lymphocytopenia in 2019 novel coronavirus infection.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04268537","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

Patients will be randomized to receive either inhaled nitric oxide (per protocol) or placebo. ICU Standards of care will be the institution's own protocols (such as ventilation strategies and use and dose of antivirals and antimicrobials, steroids, inotropic and vasopressor agents).\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\n2019-new Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection (COVID-19) is highly contagious and responsible for thousands of casualties. Originated in Wuhan (China), the 2019-nCoV is spreading to many countries, including Italy, Korea and Japan. While no targeted-treatment against 2019-nCoV virus is available to-date, inhaled nitric oxide gas (NO) has shown antiviral activity against Coronavirus during the 2003 SARS outbreak. The investigators designed this study to assess whether inhaled NO improves survival in patients affected with severe COVID-2019. The clinical spectrum of symptomatic patients ranges from mild upper respiratory syndrome to severe diffuse viral pneumonia in the context of severe multiorgan dysfunction leading to death. In China, overall reported fatality rate is between 2.2% in patients with proven infection. In hospitalized patients with COVID-19, about 25% required admission to ICU. Of these, 61% of patients met clinical criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In another retrospective study in Wuhan (China) on 52 critically ill patients with COVID-19, the incidence of patients with pneumonia meeting ARDS criteria was 67%. ICU mortality reached 63%, with various profiles of combined organ failure in deceased patients (81% with ARDS, 37.5% with AKI, 28% with cardiac injury and 28% with liver failure). In 2004, during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak, it was demonstrated that treatment with NO reversed pulmonary hypertension, improved severe hypoxia and shortened the length of ventilatory support as compared to matched control patients with SARS-CoV. In a subsequent in-vitro study, NO donors (e.g. S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine) greatly increased the survival rate of SARS-CoV-infected eukaryotic cells, suggesting direct antiviral effects of NO. Coronavirus responsible for SARS-CoV shares most of the genome of COVID-19 indicating potential effectiveness of inhaled NO therapy in these patients. Here, the investigators propose a randomized clinical trial aimed to prevent progression of the disease in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome. Control group: the institutional standard of care will be delivered. Treatment group: in addition to standard therapy, the subjects will receive inhalation of NO. Inspired NO/N2 will be delivered at 80 parts per million (ppm) in the first 48 hours of enrollment. After that, NO levels will be decreased to 40 ppm until severe hypoxia resolves. Weaning from NO will start when patients improves the level of oxygenation to a PaO2/FiO2 > 300 mmHg or SpO2 > 93% for more than 24 hours consecutively. Physician will follow their own institutional weaning protocols. In the absence of institutional protocols, NO will be reduced every 4 hours in step-wise fashion starting from 40 ppm to 20, 10, 5, 3, 2 and 1 ppm. If hypoxemia (SpO2 < 93%) or acute hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg) occurs during weaning, NO should be increased to a prior higher concentration. Safety: prolonged treatment with inhaled NO can lead to increased methemoglobin levels. Blood levels of methemoglobin will be monitored via a non-invasive CO-oximeter or MetHb levels in blood. If methemoglobin levels rise above 5% at any point of the study, inhaled NO concentration will be halved.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04290871","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

Pulmonary edema is one of the most detrimental symptoms and usually presents in severe and critical coronavirus disease (COVID-19), resulting in dyspnea, acute lung injury (ALI) ,acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and even death. Recent evidence revealed higher levels of blood Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls. VEGF is considered as the most potent vascular permeability inducers. Numerous studies have revealed that VEGF was a key factor and a potential therapeutic target in ALI and ARDS.

On February 11,2020, the World Health Organization officially named the disease caused by the new coronavirus \"COVID-19\". The Chinese Government takes stronger and harsher measures to control the progression of its outbreak. Meanwhile, five editions of \"Diagnosis and Treatment for Novel Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia\" has been timely and continuously issued, which play extremely important roles in guiding the clinical management of COVID-19 nationwide in China. The symptoms of human infection with SARS-CoV-2 are generally fever, fatigue, dry cough and dyspnea. Noteworthy, a considerable percentage of COVID-19 cases have rapidly progressed to severe and critical type, among which acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the most common complications, resulting in a large number of pneumonia hospitalized patients requiring supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or even ECMO.Pulmonary edema is a detrimental feature as well as a key causal factor of ALI/ARDS. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is considered as the most potent vascular permeability inducers. Recent evidence has revealed higher VEGF levels in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls. The rise of VEGF levels may be caused by hypoxia, severe inflammation, and upregulation of the infected respiratory tract epithelium itself. Numerous studies have confirmed a key role of VEGF as potential therapeutic target in acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due do increase vascular permeability and induce pulmonary edema. Thus, Bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF medication, may offer a unique approach to treat ALI/ARDS caused by COVID-19. Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody with long half-life. It has been approved by the FDA on February 26, 2004 and widely used in clinical oncotherapy, with the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics having been widely understood. Therefore, Bevacizumab is a promising drug for the treatment of ALI/ARDS as well as reduction of mortality in severe and critical COVID-19 patients through suppression of pulmonary edema.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04275414","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

This clinical trial is to inspect the safety and efficiency of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) therapy for pneumonia patients infected with 2019-nCoV.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\n2019-nCoV infection has become an urgent public health event in China. As of 24:00 on January 26, 2020, there are 2744 confirmed cases and 461 severe cases in China, the number is still increasing. There is currently no vaccine and no specific antiviral treatment recommended for 2019-nCoV infection. About 20% of the patients were severe and some died of respiratory failure or multiple organ failure. Therefore, it is urgent to find a safe and effective therapeutic approach to pneumonia patients infected with 2019-nCoV. In the last year, the promising features of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), including their regenerative properties and ability to differentiate into diverse cell lineages, have generated great interest among researchers whose work has offered intriguing perspectives on cell-based therapies for various diseases. These findings seem to highlight that the beneficial effect of MSC-based treatment could be principally due by the immunomodulation and regenerative potential of these cells. The investigators found that infusions of UC-MSC significantly improved liver function in decompensated liver cirrhosis and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) patients, increased the survival rate in acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) patients . MSCs could significantly reduce the pathological changes of lung and inhibit the cell-mediated immune inflammatory response induced by influenza virus in animal model .

In a short time, Chinese scientists had shared the genome information of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from these pneumonia patients and developed a real-time reverse transcription PCR (real time RT-PCR) diagnostic assay. Whilst the outbreak is likely to have started from a zoonotic transmission event associated with a large seafood market that also traded in live wild animals, it soon became clear that person-to-person transmission was also occurring. The number of cases of infection with 2019-nCoV identified in Wuhan increased markedly over the later part of January 2020, with cases identified in multiple other Provinces of China and internationally. Mathematical models of the expansion phase of the epidemic suggested that sustained person-to-person transmission is occurring, and the R-zero is substantially above 1, the level required for a self-sustaining epidemic in human populations. The clinical spectrum of 2019-nCoV infection appears to be wide, encompassing asymptomatic infection, a mild upper respiratory tract illness, and severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure and even death. Although the per infection risk of severe disease remains to be determined, and may differ from the initial reports of 10-15%, the large number of cases in Wuhan has resulted in a large number of patients hospitalised with pneumonia. Progression from prodromal symptoms (usually fever, fatigue, cough) to severe pneumonia requiring supplementary oxygen support, mechanical ventilation, or in some cases ECMO appears to occur most commonly during the second week of illness in association with persistent viral RNA detection. This provides a window of opportunity to test candidate antiviral therapeutics. This new coronavirus, and previous experiences with SARS and MERS-CoV, highlight the need for therapeutics for human coronavirus infections that can improve clinical outcomes, reduce risk of disease progression, speed recovery, and reduce the requirements for intensive supportive care and prolonged hospitalisation. In addition, treatments for mild cases to reduce the duration of illness and infectivity may also be of value were 2019-nCoV to become pandemic and/or endemic in human populations. Given no specific antiviral therapy for 2019-nCoV infection and the availability of remdesvir as a potential antiviral agent based on pre-clinical studies in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, this randomized, controlled, double blind trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of remdesivir in patients hospitalized with mild or moderate 2019-nCoV respiratory disease.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04252664","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

This clinical trial aims to evaluate the outcome of WMT combining with standard therapy for patients with 2019-novel coronavirus pneumonia, especially for those patients with dysbiosis-related conditions.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nAn ongoing outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan, China. 2019-nCoV has caused a cluster of pneumonia cases, and posed continuing epidemic threat to China and even global health. Unfortunately, there is currently no specific effective treatment for the viral infection and the related serious complications. It is in urgent need to find a new specific effective treatment for the 2019-nCoV infection. According to Declaration of Helsinki and International Ethical Guidelines for Health-related Research Involving Humans, the desperately ill patients with 2019-nCov infection during disease outbreaks have a moral right to try unvalidated medical interventions (UMIs) and that it is therefore unethical to restrict access to UMIs to the clinical trial context. There is a vital link between the intestinal tract and respiratory tract, which was exemplified by intestinal complications during respiratory disease and vice versa. Some of these patients can develop secondary bacterial infections and antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). The recent study on using washed microbiota transplantation (WMT) as rescue therapy in critically ill patients with AAD demonstrated the important clinical benefits and safety of WMT. Additionally, the recent animal study provided direct evidence supporting that antibiotics could decrease gut microbiota and the lung stromal interferon signature and facilitate early influenza virus replication in lung epithelia. Importantly, the above antibiotics caused negative effects can be reversed by fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) which suggested that FMT might be able to induce a significant improvement in the respiratory virus infection. Another evidence is that the microbiota could confer protection against certain virus infection such as influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus by priming the immune response to viral evasion. The above results suggested that FMT might be a new therapeutic option for the treatment of virus-related pneumonia. The methodology of FMT recently was coined as WMT, which is dependent on the automatic facilities and washing process in a laboratory room. Patients underwent WMT with the decreased rate of adverse events and unchanged clinical efficacy in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. This clinical trial aims to evaluate the outcome of WMT combining with standard therapy for patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia, especially for those patients with dysbiosis-related conditions.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04251767","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

The range of the incubation period is between 1 to 14 days. Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus have mild disease and recover. Approximately 80% of laboratory-confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, which includes non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases, 14% have severe disease, and 6% are critically ill with respiratory failure, shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction. Chloroquine or Hydroxychloroquine may have antiviral effects against SARS-COV2 which may prevent COVID19 disease or early preemptive therapy may ameliorate disease severity. This trial will use a modification of standard malaria dosing of hydroxychloroquine to provide post-exposure prophylaxis / preemptive therapy. The trial is open to enrollment of healthcare workers or household contacts from across the United States.

There is a lack of effective targeted antiviral drugs, and symptomatic supportive treatment is still the current main treatment for SARI. Vitamin C is significant to human body and plays a role in reducing inflammatory response and preventing common cold. In addtion, a few studies have shown that vitamin C deficiency is related to the increased risk and severity of influenza infections. We hypothize that Vitamin C infusion can help improve the prognosis of patients with SARI. Therefore, it is necessary to study the clinical efficacy and safety of vitamin C for the clinical management of SARI through randomized controlled trials during the current epidemic of SARI.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nAt the end of 2019, patients with unexplained pneumonia appeared in Wuhan, China. At 21:00 on January 7, 2020, a new coronavirus was detected in the laboratory, and the detection of pathogenic nucleic acids was completed at 20:00 on January 10. Subsequently, the World Health Organization officially named the new coronavirus that caused the pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan as 2019 new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and the pneumonia was named severe acute respiratory infection (SARI). Up to February 4, 2020, over 20000 cases have been diagnosed in China, 406 of which have died, and 154 cases have been discovered in other countries around the world. Most of the deaths were elderly patients or patients with severe underlying diseases. SARI has caused global concern and emergency. Statistics of the 41 patients with SARI published in JAMA initially showed that 13 patients were transferred into the ICU, of which 11 (85%) had ARDS and 3 (23%) had shock. Of these, 10 (77%) required mechanical ventilation support, and 2 (15%) required ECMO support. Of the above 13 patients, 5 (38%) eventually died and 7 (38%) were transferred out of the ICU. Viral pneumonia is a dangerous condition with a poor clinical prognosis. For most viral infections, there is a lack of effective targeted antiviral drugs, and symptomatic supportive treatment is still the current main treatment. Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, has antioxidant properties. When sepsis happens, the cytokine surge caused by sepsis is activated, and neutrophils in the lungs accumulate in the lungs, destroying alveolar capillaries. Early clinical studies have shown that vitamin C can effectively prevent this process. In addition, vitamin C can help to eliminate alveolar fluid by preventing the activation and accumulation of neutrophils, and reducing alveolar epithelial water channel damage. At the same time, vitamin C can prevent the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps, which is a biological event of vascular injury caused by neutrophil activation. Vitamins can effectively shorten the duration of the common cold. In extreme conditions (athletes, skiers, art workers, military exercises), it can effectively prevent the common cold. And whether vitamin C also has a certain protective effect on influenza patients, only few studies have shown that vitamin C deficiency is related to the increased risk and severity of influenza infections. In a controlled but non-randomized trial, 85% of the 252 students treated experienced a reduction in symptoms in the high-dose vitamin C group (1g / h at the beginning of symptoms for 6h, followed by 3 * 1g / day). Among patients with sepsis and ARDS, patients in the high-dose vitamin group did not show a better prognosis and other clinical outcomes. There are still some confounding factors in the existing research, and the conclusions are different. Therefore, during the current epidemic of SARI, it is necessary to study the clinical efficacy and safety of vitamin C for viral pneumonia through randomized controlled trials.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04264533","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

In severe cases, there will be rapid respiratory system failure. The novel coronavirus pneumonia is extremely contagious and the disease progresses rapidly. It has become a urgent and serious public health event that threatens human life and health globally. Among them, severe pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus is characterized by extensive acute inflammation of the lungs and the patient is critically ill. At present, there is no effective treatment in clinical practice.Most of them should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. For severe cases, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions. This clinical trial is to inspect the safety and efficiency of Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells (UC-MSCs) therapy for severe pneumonia patients infected with 2019-nCoV.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nSince December 2019, Wuhan has successively found multiple cases of patients with pneumonia infected by a novel coronavirus. With the spread of the epidemic, other cases in China and abroad have also found such cases. As of 24:00 on February 1, 2020, a total of 14,380 confirmed cases were reported in China, of which there were 2110 severe cases and 304 death cases. At present, there is no effective treatment for pneumonia in the clinic against new coronavirus infection, especially severe and critical cases. Therefore, it is of great significance to explore more active and effective therapeutic approach to severe pneumonia patients infected with 2019-nCoV. Human and animal studies have shown that after infection with coronavirus, the rapid replication of the virus in the body and the subsequent inflammatory response cause damage to alveolar epithelial cells and capillary endothelial cells, causing diffuse interstitial and alveolar edema, and pulmonary function. Impaired, leading to acute hypoxic respiratory insufficiency. The National Health and Medical Commission recently released the \"New Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan (Trial Version 5)\", which pointed out that the new type of coronavirus severe pneumonia usually has difficulty breathing after one week, and the severe cases quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, Septic shock and metabolic acidosis that is difficult to correct. It can be seen that the key to the treatment of new coronavirus severe pneumonia is to inhibit the super-inflammatory immune response caused by the virus, thereby reducing the damage of alveolar epithelial cells and capillary endothelial cells, and then repairing the structure and function of lung tissue. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are one of the most studied and important adult stem cells. A large amount of evidence shows that MSCs can migrate to and return to damaged tissues, exert strong anti-inflammatory and immune regulatory functions, promote the regeneration and repair of damaged tissues, resist apoptosis and inhibit tissue fibrosis, and reduce tissue damage. Many studies have shown that the anti-inflammatory effects of MSCs can significantly reduce virus-induced lung injury and mortality in mice. Studies have shown that MSCs can significantly reduce acute lung injury in mice caused by H9N2 and H5N1 viruses by reducing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and reducing the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the lungs. Compared with MSCs from other sources, human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (umbilical cord MSCs, UC-MSCs) have been widely used because of their convenient collection, no ethical controversy, low immunogenicity, fast self-renewal and strong proliferation ability Research on the treatment of various diseases. Early research in this laboratory used UC-MSCs to intervene in endotoxin (LPS) -induced acute lung injury in mice, and confirmed that UC-MSCs can significantly reduce inflammatory cell infiltration in lung tissue, reduce inflammation in lung tissue, and significantly improve lung The structure and function of tissues protect mouse lung tissue from endotoxin-induced damage. The purpose of this study is to investigate efficiency and safety of UC-MSCs in treating severe pneumonia patients infected with 2019-nCoV. This trial will recruit 48 patients. 24 patients received i.v. transfusion one round (4 times) of 5.0*10E6 cells/kg of UC-MSCs as the treated group, all of them received the conventional treatment. In addition, the equal 24 patients received conventional treatment were used as control group. The respiratory function, pulmonary inflammation, clinical symptoms, pulmonary imaging, side effects, 28-days mortality, immunological characteristics (immune cells, inflammatory factors, etc.) will be evaluated during the 90 days to 96 weeks follow up.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04273646","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

So far no specific antiviral therapy can be available for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although symptomatic and supportive care, even with mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), are strongly recommended for severe infected individuals, those with advancing age and co-morbidities such as diabetes and heart disease remain to be at high risk for adverse outcomes. This pilot clinical trial will be performed to explore the safety and efficiency of aerosol inhalation of the exosomes derived from allogenic adipose mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs-Exo) in severe patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP).\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nSince December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 infection has become a worldwide urgent public health event, especially in China. As of February 13, 2020, over 63,000 cases have been confirmed with over 10,200 severe cases in mainland of China. There is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment existing for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although symptomatic and supportive care are recommended for severe infected individuals, those with advancing age and co-morbidities such as diabetes and heart disease remain to be at high risk for adverse outcomes, with mortality of ~10%. Therefore, it is urgent to find a safe and effective therapeutic approach to patients with severe coronavirus disease-19(COVID-19) characterized by an severe acute respiratory impairment. Experimental studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or their exosomes (MSCs-Exo) significantly reduced lung inflammation and pathological impairment resulting from different types of lung injury. In addition, macrophage phagocytosis, bacterial killing and outcome are improved. It is highly likely that MSCs-Exo have the same therapeutic effect on inoculation pneumonia as MSCs themselves. Although human bone marrow MSCs have been safely administered in patients with ARDS and septic shock (phase I/II trials), it seems safer to deliver MSCs-Exo rather than live MSCs. The intravenous administration of MSCs may result in aggregating or clumping in the injured microcirculation and carries the risk of mutagenicity and oncogenicity, which do not exist by treating with nebulized MSCs-Exo. Another advantage of MSCs-Exo over MSCs is the possibility of storing them for several weeks/months allowing their safe transportation and delayed therapeutic use. The purpose of this single-arm design, open label, combined interventional clinical trial, therefore, is to explore the safety and efficiency of aerosol inhalation of the exosomes derived from allogenic adipose mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs-Exo) in the treatment of severe patients hospitalized with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP).","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04276987","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

The investigators hypothesize that hypertensive stroke survivors in the Washington, DC area who participate in the Home Blood Pressure Monitoring program will have a greater reduction in mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline to 3 months, as measured by automated office blood pressure (AOBP), as compared to usual care.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nThe purpose of this trial is to determine if a home blood pressure self-management (HBPS) program, including home monitoring and medication adjustments, is practical to use in recent stroke survivors and whether or not it is associated with lowering blood pressure after 3 months. Data from this trial may be used to do more research and may be used by doctors when seeing patients.This research is being done because high blood pressure, also called hypertension, is the leading risk factor for stroke. Lowering blood pressure (BP) has been shown to lower the risk of future strokes. The majority of stroke survivors continue to have uncontrolled BP. Currently, blood pressure (BP) is most often measured in the doctor's office. However, those single BP measurements are not the best picture of blood pressure over time and can be influenced by the stress of being in a doctor's office, known as the \"white coat effect\". This is why measuring BP at home may paint a more accurate picture of a patient's true long-term BP. Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) is recommended in the recently updated national hypertension guidelines. Home BP monitoring plus guided BP medication self-adjustments is associated with lower BP in patients with high blood pressure. The investigators believe that a HBPS program, including medication self-adjustment and home monitoring, may help to reduce blood pressure in patients with hypertension within 3 months.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04226157","is_covid":"no","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

The biochemical test showed abnormal increase in related indicators such as interleukin-8, and CT images showed a medical \"white\" lung\". According to the experience of SARS treatment in 2003, the use of hormones will indeed help the patients to alleviate their illness, but patients who survived SARS either had too much hormone at that time and took too long. Although the lungs could recover, but the femoral head was necrotic Either the amount of hormones was very conservative at the time, which kept the lungs in the storm of inflammatory factors, leading to the emergence of irreversible pulmonary fibrosis. So is there a medicine that can anti-inflammatory, reduce the load of hormone use, and have the effect of treating and preventing pulmonary fibrosis complicated by severe viral lung? At present, pirfenidone has achieved encouraging results in the treatment of idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (CTD-ILD) diseases. It is particularly encouraging that the values announced at the 2019 ATS Annual Conference suggest that pirfenidone has more anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects than its own outstanding anti-fibrotic ability. The data shows early use, Its strong anti-SOD activity can effectively inhibit IL-1beta and IL-4, and can open the prevention mode of pulmonary interstitial fibrosis. Based on the above, this project intends to make the following scientific assumptions: based on the homology of the pathogens of the new coronavirus-infected pneumonia and the coronavirus infection of pneumonia in 2003, the similarities in the occurrence and development of the disease, that is, the pulmonary inflammatory storm occurs first, and thereafter The progress of fibrosis and the progressive decline of lung function and mortality are higher than those of ordinary pneumonia. We hope that by adding pirfenidone as a treatment program in addition to standard treatment, it will be a new and severe type of coronavirus infection. Patient clinical treatment provides an effective and practical method.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nThis study is a multi-center, randomized, open, blank-controlled, multi-stage clinical study.

Hence most national and international guidelines now recommend that adults eat at least 2 servings per week of oily fish. However uptake of these recommendations is poor - many people do not eat seafood at all. A number of factors probably contribute to this poor compliance with guidelines; limited availability and costs of oily fish; distaste for oily fish; and concern about toxins in such fish. An Irish company, Devenish Nutrition, offers a possible alternative solution - by feeding omega-3 PUFA-enriched feeds to chicken, Devenish Nutrition have demonstrated that the resultant chicken meat and eggs are enriched in omega-3 PUFAs. A recently completed small study, with 30 participants, showed that 5 weeks of eating omega-3 PUFA enriched chicken resulted in increased blood levels of omega-3 PUFAs. There were also beneficial effects on blood pressure and on platelet stickiness. This study will be larger (including 160 participants) and longer in duration (6 months). It will be a double-blind, controlled, randomized study. This will allow testing whether eating omega-3 PUFA enriched chicken-meat regularly over a 6 month period, results in even greater increments in blood levels of omega-3 PUFAs, and in greater beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors. Beneficial effects of eating omega-3 PUFA enriched eggs will also be assessed.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nBACKGROUND There are four long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA 18:3n-3) is found in plants. However the remaining three omega-3 PUFAs, which are longer and more unsaturated (Eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA 20:5n-3, Docosapentaenoic acid, DPA 22:5n-3, and Docosahexaenoic acid, DHA 22:6n-3), are in large part found in oily seafood Consumption of oily fish, and of long chain seafood-derived omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), has been strongly and consistently associated with reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In a 2011 \"State of the Art Paper\" Mozaffarian and colleagues concluded that \"current data provide strong concordant evidence that long chain (seafood) n-3 PUFA are bioactive compounds that reduce risk of cardiac death\". Seafood derived omega-3 PUFAs influence a myriad of molecular pathways including membrane structure, ion channel properties, genetic regulation, hepatic fatty acid metabolism, eicosanoid and inflammatory mediator synthesis. It appears likely that the beneficial effects of omega-3 PUFAs are mediated through downstream effects on a range of cardiovascular risk factors including blood pressure, heart rhythm, lipid levels, inflammation, and lastly thrombotic tendency through effects on platelet function. The omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is proven essential to pre and postnatal brain development while eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is more influential on behaviour and mood. Because of the strong evidence of benefits of seafood derived omega-3 PUFAs, most national and international guidelines now recommend that adults eat at least 2 servings/week of oily fish (>250 mg/day of long-chain omega-3 PUFAs). However uptake of these recommendations is poor - many people do not consume seafood at all, and approximately one-half of U.S adults consume <60 mg/day of EPA+DHA. A number of factors probably contribute to this poor compliance; limited availability and costs of oily fish; distaste for oily fish; and concern about toxins in such fish including methylmercury, polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins. An Irish company, Devenish Nutrition, offers a possible alternative solution - by feeding algae derived omega-3 PUFAs enriched feeds to broiler chicken, Devenish Nutrition have demonstrated that the resultant chicken meat is enriched in EPA, DPA and DHA. Furthermore there was no detrimental effect to bird performance or on taste. Omega-3 enriched eggs are currently commercially available (Skea Egg Farms Ltd, Dungannon, Tyrone), and are produced in a similar fashion, through feeding omega-3 PUFAs enriched feeds to hens. In a just completed pilot study, portions of omega-3 PUFA enriched chicken-meat were eaten, three times weekly for five weeks, by 30 healthy human volunteers. Plasma levels of the 3 seafood derived omega-3 PUFAs increased from 82 ug/g at baseline to 93 ug/g at five weeks (12% increment, p=0.006), and the red cell omega-3 index (sum of EPA and DHA expressed as percentage of total fatty acids in erythrocyte membranes) increased from 4.9% to 5.1% (p = ns). At 5 weeks, two secondary end-points, blood pressure (BP) and platelet reactivity, had declined significantly in the 30 healthy volunteers - clinic systolic BP reduced from 116 to 113 mmHg (p = 0.014), and urinary thromboxane reduced from 1435 to 1024 pg/mg creatinine (p = 0.037). In this double-blind, controlled, randomized study, the investigators intend to test whether eating of omega-3 PUFA enriched chicken-meat over a 6 month period, results in greater increments in plasma and red cell levels of omega-3 PUFAs, and in greater beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors and on cognitive function and mood. In a second limb to this study the investigators will test for additional beneficial effects in humans of consumption of omega-3 PUFA enriched eggs. The red cell omega-3 index was chosen as the primary outcome for this study, because of its lessor variability over time compared to plasma values, and because of its proven correlation with EPA and DHA levels in human cardiac tissue, and in multiple relevant organs in animal models. STUDY AIMS AND OBJECTIVES The two co-primary objectives are to test whether; - The consumption of 3 servings of omega-3 PUFA-enriched chicken-meat per week, over a 6 month period, results in measurably higher red cell levels of EPA and DHA. - The consumption of 3 omega-3 enriched eggs per week, over a 6 month period, results in measurably higher red cell levels of EPA and DHA. Secondary objectives include the evaluation of: - Whether the consumption of 3 servings of omega-3 PUFA-enriched chicken-meat per week, over a 6 month period, results in measurably higher plasma levels of EPA and DHA. - Whether the consumption of 3 omega-3 enriched eggs per week, over a 6 month period, results in measurably higher plasma levels of EPA and DHA. - Whether the consumption of 3 servings of omega-3 PUFA-enriched chicken-meat per week, over a 6 month period, reduces BP, heart rate, lipid levels, inflammation and/or thrombotic tendencies. - Whether the consumption of 3 omega-3 enriched eggs per week, over a 6 month period, reduces BP, heart rate, lipid levels, inflammation and/or thrombotic tendencies. - Whether the consumption of 3 servings of omega-3 PUFA-enriched chicken-meat per week, over a 6 month period, results in improved cognitive function and/or mood. - Whether the consumption of 3 omega-3 enriched eggs per week, over a 6 month period, results in improved cognitive function and/or mood. STUDY PARTICIPANTS 160 participants will be recruited to the study through hospital out-patient departments, general practices, and by public advertisement by 2 clinical sites in Dublin, Beaumont and Connolly Hospitals, both of whom are part of the RCSI Teaching Hospital Network Academic Health Centre. STUDY DESIGN This will be a controlled, double-blind randomised study. Using a 2X2 factorial design, 160 healthy participants will be randomised to eat at least 3 portions/week of omega-3-PUFA enriched (or control) chicken-meat, and to eat at least 3 omega-3-PUFA enriched (or Control) eggs/week, for 6 months STUDY CONDUCT Prior to recruitment to the study, potential participants will be given comprehensive information about the study, unlimited time to study this written information, and all questions will be answered by a study investigator. If the potential participant is satisfied with this information, and wishes to participate, written informed consent will be taken. At the screening visit, a comprehensive lifestyle and medical history will be taken. A food frequency questionnaire will be completed to capture food intake over the previous year. Clinic and ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate will also be measured, as will height, weight, body mass index, and waist circumference. Finally, assessment of cognitive function and mood will be carried out by a battery of tests. A fasting blood sample will be taken to allow measurement of plasma and red cell levels of EPA and DHA, full blood count (platelet count), renal function, liver function, plasma lipid levels, inflammation (high sensitivity C-reactive protein), platelet function (platelet aggregation and serum thromboxane), and DNA extraction. Urine sampling will also occur to allow assessment of platelet turnover (urinary thromboxane/creatinine ratio), and renal function (microalbuminuria). After all screening assessments have been completed, and if all inclusion and exclusion criteria are satisfied, participants will be randomized to eating omega-3 PUFA enriched chicken-meat or control chicken-meat, and to omega-3 PUFA enriched eggs or control eggs, for the 6 month period. Randomization will be stratified according to gender. Omega-3 PUFA enriched chicken (whole chickens, breasts, thighs, drums and wings) and eggs, or the appropriate control chicken and control eggs, will be delivered to the homes of study participants at regular intervals (weekly or two-weekly), so that both they, and up to four family members, will be able to eat at least 3 servings per week of chicken meat, and at least 3 eggs weekly over the 6 month study period. The chicken-meat will be delivered frozen, and the eggs will be delivered refrigerated. Participants will be asked to avoid the taking of omega-3 PUFA supplements, antihypertensives, lipid lowering therapy, antiplatelet therapy such as aspirin, or any non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nurofen, indomethacin, diclofenac etc) for the duration of the study. If an analgesic is needed paracetamol may be used. Participants will be asked to fast, not drink tea or coffee, not smoke and not engage in intense exercise from midnight (minimum 8 hours) prior to the screening (baseline) visit, and prior to the 3 and 6 month visits. Participants may drink water and take essential medications on these mornings. At both the 3 month and the 6 month (final) visit, all baseline assessments will be repeated. At months 1,2,4 and 5 a telephone call will be made to check on participant well-being (absence of adverse events), and on compliance with diet. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Standard summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, range, %) will be used to describe baseline characteristics of the participants. Changes in both the primary and the secondary end-points, at 3 and 6 months from baseline, with consumption of omega-3 enriched chicken-meat and eggs, will be compared to the changes recorded with consumption of control chicken-meat and eggs, using two-way ANOVA. SAMPLE SIZE CONSIDERATIONS The primary objective of this study is to test whether the consumption of 3 servings per week of omega-3 PUFA-enriched chicken-meat and/or the consumption of 3 omega-3 PUFA enriched eggs, over a 6 month period results in measurably higher red levels of EPA and DHA (red cell omega-3 index). From the recently completed pilot study, wherein 30 healthy community dwelling subjects ate three servings per week of omega-3-PUFA enriched chicken meat for 5 weeks, the baseline omega-3 index was 4.93% (standard deviation 1.11%). This increased to 5.12% (1.18%) after 5 weeks. The mean difference was 0.19% (0.44%). In order to achieve a power of 95% to detect a difference of 1% in the omega-3 index between those eating control and enriched chicken-meat, and between those eating control and enriched eggs, at a 2-sided-level of 0.05, a sample size of 132 participants is required. To allow for potential losses to follow-up, enrollment of 160 participants is planned.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04127409","is_covid":"no","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

This study is a placebo-controlled trial of D-serine in the symptomatic treatment of patients with the schizophrenia prodrome. Seventy two subjects meeting criteria for the schizophrenia prodrome will be included in this study, 24 at each site (Yale, Nathan Kline Institute and Zucker Hillside Hospital). The primary outcome measures will include symptom and neuropsychological measures. The duration of this study is two and a half years. This research with D-serine holds out the prospect of direct benefit for the patient's current symptoms.

We propose for prodromal patients to be randomized to D-serine vs placebo for 16 weeks. To insure that all subjects have the opportunity to receive D-serine, there will be an optional 16 week cross-over trial on the alternate study medication. No subject will be on D-serine for longer than 16 weeks. Admission criteria, Assessment Procedures, and Study Design will be the same across all sites. The procedures and timeline are shown in Table 1. The procedures and timeline are the same for the initial randomized 16 week trial and the optional cross-over trial on the alternate study medication. If patient's opt for the 16 week treatment on the alternate medication, we will use their assessments from end of initial treatment as baseline for 16 week treatment on alternate medication. Subjects will be seen for two preliminary visits, then once in treatment, subjects will be seen weekly for the first 5 visits then biweekly thereafter. A safety blood and urine collection will be done on day 3 (3 days after the start of study medication). Vital signs and weight, blood draw and urine collection for safety measures, urine pregnancy test and urine for toxicology will be repeated throughout treatment. Adverse effects ratings and symptom assessments will be repeated at each visit. Neuropsychological assessment and optional \"Biomarker study\" visual, auditory and ERPs tasks will be administered during one of the two preliminary visits then again at study endpoint.

Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in BC has been widely studied and the positive effects of its routine evaluation on the improvement of communication between patients and medical staff and survival have been highlighted. Recently, a link between HRQoL and compliance with ET has been suggested, which would suggest a potential role for HRQoL assessment in improving compliance with ET. With the advent of digital technologies, electronic collection of HRQoL on a tablet is now possible. Since compliance is a multidimensional phenomenon, a multifaceted intervention is necessary to improve it. Thus, the investigators hypothesize that systematic HRQoL assessment (using a tablet, prior to each consultation, with delivery of scores to clinicians) coupled with therapeutic information could have an impact on 12-month compliance with ET in patients with non-metastatic BC.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nIn this study, 342 women with non-metastatic hormone receptor positive breast cancer with an indication for treatment with endocrine therapy will be include. Participants will be recruited at Dijon cancer center (Georges Francois Leclerc- center) in France. This center is specialized in cancer management, therefore clinicians are experienced in patient's HRQoL evaluation and are accustomed to take this criterion into consideration in the routine patient management. The study will be proposed to eligible participants by their doctors (oncologists, surgeons, radiation oncologists). Participants will be included at the time of the first prescription of ET (at the end of the treatments by surgery +/- chemotherapy +/- radiotherapy). Once included, participants will be randomized (ratio 1:1) by minimization and stratified by: age, stage, type of ET prescribed and presence or not of comorbidities, in 2 arms. Participants will then be referred to the clinical research associates, whose role will be to collect participant data (clinical and sociodemographic) in both study arms and to instruct participants in the interventional arm on how to use the Computer-based Health Evaluation System (CHES) software. For participants who wish to access the platform from home, a login and password will also be provided. If needed, clinical research associates will also assist participants to complete HRQoL questionnaires. This information will be collected in the case report form, to take into account the social desirability bias. The intervention will consist of numerical HRQoL assessment using the CHES software before each consultation (with delivery of scores to clinicians) coupled with therapeutic information. HRQoL assessment will be performed at each visit. As the aim of this project is to integrate this intervention in daily clinical practice, it will be performed in agreement with patients' routine follow-up. Participants will complete the questionnaires prior to each consultation, either at home via access to the web portal within 24 hours before consultation, or at the time of consultation. During consultation physician will have access to the results immediately, via the secure web portal, and will be able to discuss them with the participant. Therapeutic information will consist on 3 workshops. Workshop 1, entitled \"Understanding the Prescription\" will provide information on ET and its benefits. Two additional optional workshops on nutrition and fatigue will also be offered. Every month, a letter encouraging participants to regularly take their medication will be sent. Participants in the control group will follow standard care. Both in two arms, HRQoL will be evaluated at baseline using the FACT-G questionnaire to ensure the comparability of groups concerning HRQoL at inclusion, and again at 12 months. HRQoL assessment will be performed using a traditional paper questionnaire and scores will not be provided to clinicians. Anxiety and depression, social support and participant satisfaction with care will also be assessed in both arms at baseline and 12 months after. Sociodemographic characteristics, medical and surgical history, date of tumor diagnosis, tumor characteristics, previous treatments, participant clinical characteristics at inclusion and at each follow-up visit (weight, height, overall patient condition), concomitant treatment, type of ET received, HRQoL data (FACT-G), anxiety and depression (HADS), social support (SSQ6), treatment modification (change in the type of ET), treatment-related toxicities and their grade will be collected. Participant satisfaction with provided care will be measured. Clinicians' perceptions of systematic HRQoL assessment will be collected via an ad hoc questionnaire. Sociodemographic data and reasons for refusing to participate will also be documented for patients who refuse to participate. Data on patients' withdrawal or death will be documented in the case report form. Reasons for study withdrawal should also be documented. All data from this study will be transcribed in an electronic case report form. A descriptive analysis of participants' clinical and socio-demographic characteristics at inclusion will be performed for each arm. All HRQoL scores will be calculated according to FACT-G guidelines and described according to the arm (interventional arm or control arm). A logistic regression model will be used to assess the capacity of HRQoL to predict 12-month compliance with endocrine therapy. The modulatory potential of social support on compliance will be assessed using an interaction term between the availability / satisfaction of social support that patients receive and HRQoL in a logistic regression model. The modulatory potential of psychological distress on compliance will be assessed using an interaction term between patient anxiety / depression and HRQoL in a logistic regression model. An analysis of missing HRQoL data profiles will also be performed. If a Missing Not At Random (MNAR) profile is demonstrated / suspected, multiple imputation of missing data can be performed in sensitivity analysis, taking into account the variables associated with the occurrence of missing data. As a sensitivity analysis, the investigators will performed a contamination-based intent-to-treat analysis to account for potential cross-contamination between the arms.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04176809","is_covid":"no","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

Although the virus (SARS-Cov-2) nucleic acid RT-PCR test has become the standard method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, these real-time PCR test kits have many limitations. In addition, high false negative rates were reported. There is an urgent need for an accurate and rapid test method to quickly identify large number of infected patients and asymptomatic carriers to prevent virus transmission and assure timely treatment of patients. We have developed a rapid and simple point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay which can detect IgM and IgG antibodies simultaneously against SARS-CoV-2 virus in human blood within 15 minutes which can detect patients at different infection stages. With this test kit, we carried out clinical studies to validate its clinical efficacy uses. The clinical detection sensitivity and specificity of this test were measured using blood samples collected from 397 PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients and 128 negative patients at 8 different clinical sites. The overall testing sensitivity was 88.66% and specificity was 90.63%. In addition, we evaluated clinical diagnosis results obtained from different types of venous and fingerstick blood samples. The results indicated great detection consistency among samples from fingerstick blood, serum and plasma of venous blood. The IgM-IgG combined assay has better utility and sensitivity compared with a single IgM or IgG test. It can be used for the rapid screening of SARS-CoV-2 carriers, symptomatic or asymptomatic, in hospitals, clinics, and test laboratories. This article is protected by copyright.

Methods: A continuous cohort of adults and adolescent (≥12 years) who screened COVID-19 was included in Xiangya Hospital of Central South University from January 23 to February 3, 2020 in which cases were divided the test library and the verification library. Their gender, age, onset time were recorded. Take epidemiological history, fever, and the blood lymphocytes decline as clinical indicators, used CT to evaluate the possibility of COVID-19 and range of lung involvement. According to the current national standards, throat swabs of suspected cases were collected and the nucleic acid of COVID-19 was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The Xiangya process was constructed according to multi-index, compared with clinical indicators, CT results and national standards, the efficiency of detecting confirmed cases were verified in the test and verification library. Results: A continuous cohort of 382 adults who screened COVID-19 was included in which 261 cases were in the test library and 121 cases were in the verification library. In the 382 cases, 192 were males (50.3%) and 190 were females (49.7%), with a median age of 35 years (range: 15-92 years). There were 183 cases (47.9%) with epidemiological history, 275 cases (72.0%) with fever, 212 cases (55.5%) with decreased hemolytic lymphocytes, CT positive 114 cases (29.8%), 43 cases (11.3%) with positive CT-COVID-19, and 30 cases (7.9%) with positive throat swab nucleic acid. Compared with clinical indicators, the sensitivity and specificity of CT were 0.950 and 0.704, respectively. The accuracy of CT to make a definite diagnosis was higher than that of epidemiological history, fever, and blood lymph count decline (0.809 vs 0.660, 0.532, 0.596, P=0.001, 0.002, 0.003, respectively). The sensitivity of this process and the program recommended by the Health Commission all were high (all were 1.000) , and the specificity and accuracy of the process were higher than the program recommended by the Health Commission (0.872 vs 0.765, 0.778 vs 0.592, both P<0.001). The CT-COVID-19 would have reduced the missed diagnosis rate caused by false negative of nucleic acid test (31 vs 64, difference rate 51.6%), the positive rate of nucleic acid test was 64.5% (20/31). In validation library, the specificity and accuracy of the Xiangya process was 0.967, the positive rate of nucleic acid test was 76.9% (10/13). Conclusions: The Xiangya process can predict the nucleic acid test results of COVID-19 well, and can be applied as a reliable basis for confirmed cases detection in adults and adolescent (≥12 years) in areas other than Hubei during the epidemic period of COVID-19. The cohort size needs to be increased for further validation.","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"unclear","is_observational":"unclear","is_duplicate":false},

The virus has since rapidly spread to all provinces and autonomous regions of China, and to countries outside of China. Patients who become infected with 2019-nCoV may initially develop mild upper respiratory tract symptoms. However, a significant fraction of these patients goes on to subsequently develop serious lower respiratory disease. The effectiveness of adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy uses in the management of 2019-nCoV infected patients with severe lower respiratory tract infections is not clear, and warrants further investigation. METHODS: The present study will be conducted as an open-labelled, randomised controlled trial. We will enrol 48 subjects from Chongqing Public Health Medical Center. Each eligible subject will be assigned to an intervention group (methylprednisolone via intravenous injection at a dose of 1-2mg/kg/day for 3 days) or a control group (no glucocorticoid use) randomly, at a 1:1 ratio. Subjects in both groups will be invited for 28 days of follow-up which will be scheduled at 4 consecutive visit points. We will use the clinical improvement rate as our primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints include the timing of clinical improvement after intervention, duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of hospitalization, overall incidence of adverse events, as well as rate of adverse events at each visit, and mortality at 2 and 4 weeks. DISCUSSION: The present coronavirus outbreak is the third serious global coronavirus outbreak in the past two decades. Oral and parenteral glucocorticoids have been used in the management of severe respiratory symptoms in coronavirus-infected patients in the past. However, there remains no definitive evidence in the literature for or against the utilization of systemic glucocorticoids in seriously ill patients with coronavirus-related severe respiratory disease, or indeed in other types of severe respiratory disease. In this study, we hope to discover evidence either supporting or opposing the systemic therapeutic administration of glucocorticoids in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.

Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir-ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first. RESULTS: A total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir-ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group. Treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72). Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir-ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs. 25.0%; difference, -5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, -17.3 to 5.7). The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar. In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir-ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir-ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group. Lopinavir-ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir-ritonavir treatment beyond standard care.

Os casos possuíam vínculo epidemiológico entre si e exposição a um mercado de produtos marinhos. Foi aventada a possibilidade de transmissão por meio do contato com animais marinhos manipulados no mercado. Inicialmente observado como um evento limitado à cidade de Wuhan, o número de casos e óbitos aumentou rapidamente e disseminou-se para outras províncias chinesas. O governo chinês adotou, então, medidas de contenção e isolamento de cidades no intuito de mitigar o evento. Pesquisadores chineses conseguiram identificar o provável causador da SRA: um novo coronavírus, denominado inicialmente como 2019­nCoV. Atualmente chamado SARS-CoV-2. A doença é chamada COVID-2019 (do inglês: CO=Corona, VI=Vírus, D=Disease). Em 30/01/2020, diante da realidade de disseminação mundial do novo coronavírus, que naquele momento já havia sido notificado em 18 países, além da China, e com transmissão pessoa a pessoa confirmada em três deles, a Organização Mundial de Saúde (OMS) declarou o evento como Emergência de Saúde Pública de Importância Internacional (ESPII). Enfatizou a necessidade, urgente, de estudos que identificassem a fonte da infecção, a forma de transmissão, o sequenciamento genético do vírus para o desenvolvimento de vacinais e medicamentos antivirais, bem como o fortalecimento da preparação e resposta ao novo evento, especialmente nos países e regiões mais vulneráveis. Em 03 de fevereiro de 2020 foi declarada Emergência em Saúde Pública de Importância Nacional (ESPIN) em decorrência da infecção humana pelo novo Coronavírus (SARS-CoV-2): Portaria GM/MS Nº188, 03/02/2020.

We ran high-fidelity, in situ simulation of high-risk procedures on patients with COVID-19 in a negative-pressure side room on our intensive care unit. Our aim was to identify potential problems, to test the robustness of our systems and to inform modification of our standard operating procedures for any patients with COVID-19 admitted to our intensive care unit. The simulations revealed several important latent risks and allowed us to put corrective measures in place prior to the admission of patients with COVID-19.

Nas semanas seguintes, foram detectados casos em outras províncias da China, que concentrava aproximadamente 99% dos casos ocorridos em todo o mundo (até 12 de fevereiro de 2020). Outros países também foram afetados, com predominância da ocorrência de casos importados da China, embora há registro de transmissão autóctone em alguns países. A evolução da situação levou a OMS a declarar o evento como uma Emergência de Saúde Pública de Importância Internacional, em 30 de janeiro de 2020, conforme estabelece o Regulamento Sanitário Internacional (RSI 2005). O agente etiológico é um novo Coronavirus (COVID ­ 19; nome anterior - 2019- nCoV) 1 , que foi transmitido inicialmente a partir de contato ou consumo de animais silvestres na cidade de Wuhan, posteriormente com transmissão predominante por meio de contato de pessoa-a-pessoa em algumas localidades na China e outros países, como por exemplo na Alemanha. Com a confirmação de mais de 40.000 casos no início de fevereiro de 2020, as principais características dessa epidemia são: o período de incubação estimado por meio de 6 estudos publicados até este momento apresenta uma variação entre 0 a 24 dias 2,3,4,5,6,7, embora a OMS estime entre 1 a 12,5 dias (mediana 5-6) 8 ; a transmissibilidade, medida pelo número básico de transmissão (1,4 a 2,5)9 , é maior do que a registrada em epidemia anterior pelo Coronavírus (2002/2003); a taxa de letalidade é estimada em 2%1 é menor do que a registrada na epidemia anterior pelo Coronavírus (9,6%). Este documento tem o objetivo de sistematizar as ações e procedimentos no que diz respeito à resposta à epidemia pelo Coronavírus 2019 (COVID-19), a serem desenvolvidas pela Secretaria de Estado de Saúde do Distrito Federal (SES/DF). As ações propostas estão previstas para a fase atual da epidemia e a situação de risco do país em relação à potencial introdução e disseminação no território nacional. Nesse contexto, considerando a organização do Plano Nacional Contingência para Infecção Humana pelo Coronavírus 2019 (COVID ­ 19)10, em que as atividades previstas são elaboradas a partir de uma classificação de risco em três níveis de resposta (Alerta, Perigo Iminente e Emergência em Saúde Pública) e tendo em vista que o Ministério da Saúde (MS) declarou Emergência de Saúde Pública de Importância Nacional em 04 de fevereiro de 202011 , a organização das ações a serem desenvolvidas pela SES/DF já parte desse nível de resposta. Cabe destacar que no momento da elaboração do presente plano não havia sido detectado nenhum caso confirmado de infecção pelo Coronavírus no país. Assim, a eventual detecção e disseminação poderá implicar algumas mudanças neste Plano, de acordo com a evolução da situação epidemiológica. Este cenário deve ser monitorado periodicamente, tendo em vista o desenvolvimento de conhecimento científico e situação em evolução, para garantir que o nível de resposta seja adequado e as medidas correspondentes sejam adotadas.","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"unclear","is_observational":"unclear","is_duplicate":false},

No Brasil, os estados vêm fortalecendo as suas capacidades básicas para a detecção e resposta ao 2019-nCoV, que é zoonótico e causa doenças respiratórias. Nesse contexto, são indispensáveis a implementação e o fortalecimento de políticas públicas de saúde que possam contribuir para minimizar os impactos de uma epidemia, contudo, sua eficiência está condicionada a atuação conjunta e ordenada dos setores públicos e privados. Partindo dessa compreensão, e observando as diretrizes nacionais propostas pela Secretaria de Vigilância em Saúde/Ministério da Saúde ­ SVS/MS, a Secretaria de Estado da Saúde do Maranhão (SES/MA) vem juntando esforços no sentido de promover resposta coordenada para uma situação de instalação da doença no estado.O Plano de Contingência para o 2019-nCov no Maranhão, elaborado com base no modelo de Gestão de Riscos, propõe a identificação de ações de gestão, vigilância epidemiológica e sanitária, assistência à saúde, diagnóstico e educação em saúde, onde contempla os três níveis de resposta e as ações em cada nível, conforme o perfil epidemiológico do momento. Os três níveis de resposta são: Alerta, Perigo Iminente e Emergência em Saúde Pública de Importância Nacional ­ ESPIN.

However, it is also important for clinicians and epidemiologists to differentiate COVID-19 from other respiratory infectious diseases, such as influenza viruses. Research question The aim of the study was to explore the different clinical presentations between COVID-19 and influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Study Design and Methods: This was a retrospective case-control study. We compared two independent cohorts of ARDS patients infected with either COVID-19 (n=73) or H1N1 (n=75). We analyzed and compared their clinical manifestations, imaging characteristics, treatments, and prognosis. Results The median age of COVID-19 patients was higher than that of H1N1 patients, and there was a higher proportion of males among COVID-19 patients (p<0.05). COVID-19 patients exhibited higher proportions of non-productive coughs, fatigue, and gastrointestinal symptoms than those of H1N1 patients (p<0.05). H1N1 patients had higher sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores than COVID-19 patients (p<0.05). The PaO2/FiO2 of 198.2 mmHg in COVID-19 patients was significantly higher than the PaO2/FiO2 of 107.0 mmHg of H1N1 patients (p<0.001). Ground-glass opacities was more common in COVID-19 patients than in H1N1 patients (p<0.001). There was a greater variety of antiviral therapies administered to COVID-19 patients than to H1N1 patients. The in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients was 28.8%, while that of H1N1 patients was 34.7% (p=0.483). SOFA-score adjusted mortality of H1N1 patients was significantly higher than that of COVID-19 patients with the rate ratio was 2.009 (95% CI [1.563, 2.583], p<0.001). Interpretation There were many differences between COVID-19 and H1N1-induced ARDS patients in clinical presentations. Compared with H1N1, patients with COVID-19 induced ARDS had lower severity of illness scores at presentation and lower SOFA-score adjusted mortality.","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

Although the case fatality rate is not high, the number of people infected is large, and there are still a large number of patients dying. With the collation and publication of more and more clinical data, a large number of data suggest that there are mild or severe cytokine storms in severe patients, which is also an important cause of death. Therefore, the treatment of cytokine storm has become an important part of rescuing severe patients. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays an important role in cytokine release syndrome (CRS). If it can block the signal transduction pathway of IL-6, it is expected to become a new method for the treatment of severe patients. Tocilizumab is a blocker of IL-6R, which can effectively block IL-6 signal transduction pathway. So, tocilizumab is likely to become an effective drug for patients with severe COVID-19.","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

The clinical and laboratory findings were extracted from the electronic medical records of the patients. The data were analysed and reviewed by a trained team of physicians. Information on clinical signs and symptoms, medical treatment, virus clearance, and laboratory parameters including interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein were collected. COVID-19 mRNA clearance ratio was identified significantly correlated with the decline of serum creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. Furthermore, COVID-19 mRNA clearance time was positively correlated with the length of hospital stay in patients treated with either IFN-α + lopinavir/ritonavir or IFN-α + lopinavir/ritonavir + ribavirin. Therapeutic regimens of IFN-α + lopinavir/ritonavir and IFN-α + lopinavir/ritonavir + ribavirin might be beneficial for treatment of COVID-19.

METHODS: To assess the factors associated with severity and prognosis of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, we retrospectively investigated the clinical, imaging, and laboratory characteristics of confirmed 280 cases of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from January 20 to February 20, 2020. RESULTS: The median age of patients in the mild group was 37.55 years old, while that in the severe group was 63.04 years old. The proportion of patients over 65 years old in the severe group was significantly higher than that of the mild group (59.04% vs. 10.15%, P < 0.05). 85.54% of severe patients had diabetes or cardiovascular diseases, which was significantly higher than that of the mild group (51.81% vs 7.11%, P = 0.025; 33.73% vs 3.05%, P = 0.042). Patients in the mild group experienced earlier initiation of antiviral treatment (1.19 ± 0.45 vs 2.65 ± 1.06 days in the severe group, P < 0.001). Our study showed that comorbidity, time from illness onset to antiviral, and age >=65 were three major risk factors for COVID-19 progression, while comorbidity and time from illness onset to antiviral were two major risk factors for COVID-19 recovery. CONCLUSIONS: The elderly and patients with underlying diseases are more likely to experience a severe progression of COVID-19. It is recommended that timely antiviral treatment should be initiated to slow the disease progression and improve the prognosis.","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

However, its efficacy remains to be validated. METHODS: Coagulation results, medications and outcomes of consecutive patients being classified as severe COVID-19 in Tongji hospital were retrospectively analysed. The 28-day mortality between heparin users and nonusers were compared, also in different risk of coagulopaphy which was stratified by the sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) score or D-dimer result. RESULTS: There were 449 patients with severe COVID-19 enrolled into the study, 99 of them received heparin (mainly with low molecular weight heparin, LMWH) for 7 days or longer. The D-dimer, prothrombin time and age were positively, and platelet count was negatively, correlated with 28-day mortality in multivariate analysis. No difference on 28-day mortality was found between heparin users and nonusers (30.3% vs 29.7%, P=0.910).

The unabated spread of the disease is due to lack of vaccine and effective therapeutic agents against this novel virus. Hence, the situation demands an immediate need to explore all the plausible therapeutic and prophylactic strategies that can be made available to stem the spread of the disease. Towards this effort, the current review outlines the key aspects of the pathobiology associated with the morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients, which includes a viral response phase and an exaggerated host response phase. The review also summarizes therapeutic agents that are currently being explored along with those with potential for consideration. The broad groups of therapeutic agents discussed include those that: (i) block viral entry to host cells, (ii) block viral replication and survival in host cells, and (iii) dampen exaggerated host immune response. The various kinds of pharmaceutical prophylactic options that may be followed to prevent COVID-19 have also been discussed.","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

We evaluate the role of hydroxychloroquine on respiratory viral loads. PATIENTS AND METHODS: French Confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in a single arm protocol from early March to March 16(th), to receive 600mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and their viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs was tested daily in a hospital setting. Depending on their clinical presentation, azithromycin was added to the treatment. Untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the protocol were included as negative controls. Presence and absence of virus at Day6-post inclusion was considered the end point. RESULTS: Six patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and eight had lower respiratory tract infection symptoms. Twenty cases were treated in this study and showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage at D6-post inclusion compared to controls, and much lower average carrying duration than reported of untreated patients in the literature.

Objective To analyze the clinical characteristics of elderly patients with 2019 new-type coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19). Methods This is a retrospective study of patients with new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) who were hospitalized in Hainan Provincial People's Hospital from January 15, 2020 to February 18, 2020. Compare the clinical characteristics of elderly with Young and Middle-aged patients. Results A total of 56 patients were enrolled 18 elderly patients (32.14%), and 38 young and middle-aged patients (67.86%). The most common symptoms in both groups were fever, followed by cough and sputum. Four patients in the elderly group received negative pressure ICU for mechanical ventilation, and five patients in the young and middle-aged group. One patient died in the elderly group (5.56%), and two patients died in the young and middle-aged group (5.26%). The PSI score of the elderly group was higher than that of the young and middle-aged group (P < 0.001). The proportion of patients with PSI grades IV and V was significantly higher in the elderly group than in the young and middle-aged group (P < 0.05). The proportion of multiple lobe involvement in the elderly group was higher than that in the young and middle-aged group (P < 0.001), and there was no difference in single lobe lesions between the two groups. The proportion of lymphocytes in the elderly group was significantly lower than that in the young and middle-aged group (P < 0.001), and the C-reactive protein was significantly higher in the young group (P < 0.001).

In this study, we collected the daily death numbers of COVID-19, meteorological parameters and air pollutant data from 20 January 2020 to 29 February 2020 in Wuhan, China. Generalized additive model was applied to explore the effect of temperature, humidity and diurnal temperature range on the daily death counts of COVID-19. There were 2299 COVID-19 death counts in Wuhan during the study period. A positive association with COVID-19 daily death counts was observed for diurnal temperature range (r = 0.44), but negative association for relative humidity (r = −0.32). In addition, one unit increase in diurnal temperature range was only associated with a 2.92% (95% CI: 0.61%, 5.28%) increase in COVID-19 deaths in lag 3. However, both 1 unit increase of temperature and absolute humidity were related to the decreased COVID-19 death in lag 3 and lag 5, with the greatest decrease both in lag 3 [−7.50% (95% CI: −10.99%, −3.88%) and −11.41% (95% CI: −19.68%, −2.29%)].

More than 16% of patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, and the fatality ratio was about 1%–2%. No specific treatment has been reported. Herein, we examine the effects of Favipiravir (FPV) versus Lopinavir (LPV)/ritonavir (RTV) for the treatment of COVID-19. Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who received oral FPV (Day 1: 1600 mg twice daily; Days 2–14: 600 mg twice daily) plus interferon (IFN)-α by aerosol inhalation (5 million U twice daily) were included in the FPV arm of this study, whereas patients who were treated with LPV/RTV (Days 1–14: 400 mg/100 mg twice daily) plus IFN-α by aerosol inhalation (5 million U twice daily) were included in the control arm. Changes in chest computed tomography (CT), viral clearance, and drug safety were compared between the two groups. For the 35 patients enrolled in the FPV arm and the 45 patients in the control arm, all baseline characteristics were comparable between the two arms. A shorter viral clearance time was found for the FPV arm versus the control arm (median (interquartile range, IQR), 4 (2.5–9) d versus 11 (8–13) d, P < 0.001). The FPV arm also showed significant improvement in chest imaging compared with the control arm, with an improvement rate of 91.43% versus 62.22% (P = 0.004).

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of N95 respirators versus surgical masks for prevention of influenza by collecting randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods We searched PubMed, EMbase and The Cochrane Library from the inception to January 27, 2020 to identify relevant systematic reviews. The RCTs included in systematic reviews were identified. Then we searched the latest published RCTs from the above three databases and searched ClinicalTrials.gov for unpublished RCTs. Two reviewers independently extracted the data and assessed risk of bias. Meta-analyses were conducted to calculate pooled estimates by using RevMan 5.3 software. Results A total of six RCTs involving 9 171 participants were included. There were no statistically significant differences in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza (RR = 1.09, 95% CI 0.92-1.28, P > .05), laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections (RR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.70-1.11), laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection (RR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.42-1.29) and influenzalike illness (RR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.33-1.14) using N95 respirators and surgical masks. Meta-analysis indicated a protective effect of N95 respirators against laboratory-confirmed bacterial colonization (RR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.43-0.78). Conclusion The use of N95 respirators compared with surgical masks is not associated with a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza. It suggests that N95 respirators should not be recommended for general public and nonhigh-risk medical staff those are not in close contact with influenza patients or suspected patients.","is_covid":"no","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

METHODS: We conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao(2)) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao(2)) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio(2)) of less than 300 mm Hg. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir-ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first. RESULTS: A total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir-ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group. Treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72). Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir-ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs. 25.0%; difference, -5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, -17.3 to 5.7). The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar. In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir-ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir-ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group. Lopinavir-ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir-ritonavir treatment beyond standard care.

For this, both ACE and AII have been widely exploited as pharmacological targets in the treatment of hypertension, heart failure or diabetic nephropathy by means of ACE inhibitors and AII receptor antagonists, respectively [1]. In addition, homologous ACE2 receptors have been identified on the oral mucosa, in type-II pneumocytes, along the intestine and on the kidney and heart endothelia [1], [2]; these receptors have been found overexpressed in course of ACE inhibitors and AII receptor antagonists administration in murine models [3], [4]. Hypothesis Surprisingly, the surface spike proteins of the ‘severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-2’ (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of the ongoing ‘coronavirus disease 2019’ (COVID-19), are able to bind the ACE2 receptors [2]. Therefore, a hypothesis arises: could a chronic therapeutic assumption of ACE inhibitors or AII receptor antagonists have induced several elderly and middle-aged patients to be more vulnerable to the virus by upregulating ACE2 receptors? If we translate the murine model to the human cells, the expected result would be that shown in the figure (Fig. 1). In our opinion, during the COVID-19 pandemic, it would be more prudent to replace these drugs, when possible, with calcium channel blockers, adrenergic receptor blockers, diuretics or vasodilators.

In light of the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we aimed to review existing health security capacities against public health risks and events. METHODS: We used 18 indicators from the IHR State Party Annual Reporting (SPAR) tool and associated data from national SPAR reports to develop five indices: (1) prevent, (2) detect, (3) respond, (4) enabling function, and (5) operational readiness. We used SPAR 2018 data for all of the indicators and categorised countries into five levels across the indices, in which level 1 indicated the lowest level of national capacity and level 5 the highest. We also analysed data at the regional level (using the six geographical WHO regions). FINDINGS: Of 182 countries, 52 (28%) had prevent capacities at levels 1 or 2, and 60 (33%) had response capacities at levels 1 or 2. 81 (45%) countries had prevent capacities and 78 (43%) had response capacities at levels 4 or 5, indicating that these countries were operationally ready. 138 (76%) countries scored more highly in the detect index than in the other indices. 44 (24%) countries did not have an effective enabling function for public health risks and events, including infectious disease outbreaks (7 [4%] at level 1 and 37 [20%] at level 2). 102 (56%) countries had level 4 or level 5 enabling function capacities in place. 32 (18%) countries had low readiness (2 [1%] at level 1 and 30 [17%] at level 2), and 104 (57%) countries were operationally ready to prevent, detect, and control an outbreak of a novel infectious disease (66 [36%] at level 4 and 38 [21%] at level 5). INTERPRETATION: Countries vary widely in terms of their capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to outbreaks. Half of all countries analysed have strong operational readiness capacities in place, which suggests that an effective response to potential health emergencies could be enabled, including to COVID-19. Findings from local risk assessments are needed to fully understand national readiness capacities in relation to COVID-19.

Methods A retrospective study of patients’ data was conducted using the Emergency Rescue Database of Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital. Patients were divided into the fatal adverse prognosis group and the good prognosis group. The commonly used clinical indicators were compared. Recursive feature elimination (RFE) method was used to determine the optimal number of the included variables. In the training model, logistic regression, random forest, adaboost and bagging were selected. We also collected the emergency room data from December 2018 to December 2019 with the same inclusion and exclusion criterion. The performance of the model was evaluated by accuracy, F1-score, precision, sensitivity and the areas under receiver operator characteristic curves (ROC-AUC). Results The accuracy of logistic regression, decision tree, adaboost and bagging was 0.951, 0.928, 0.924, and 0.924, F1-scores were 0.938, 0.933, 0.930, and 0.930, the precision was 0.943, 0.938, 0.937, and 0.937, ROC-AUC were 0.808, 0.738, 0.736, and 0.885, respectively. ROC-AUC of ten-fold cross-validation in logistic and bagging models were 0.80 and 0.87, respectively. The top six coefficients and odds ratio (OR) values of the variables in the Logistic regression were cardiac troponin T (CTnT) (coefficient=0.346, OR = 1.413), temperature (T) (coefficient=0.235, OR = 1.265), respiratory rate (RR) (coefficient= –0.206,OR = 0.814), serum kalium (K) (coefficient=0.137, OR = 1.146), pulse oxygen saturation (SPO2) (coefficient= –0.101, OR = 0.904), and albumin (ALB) (coefficient= –0.043, OR = 0.958). The weights of the top six variables in the bagging model were: CTnT, RR, lactate dehydrogenase, serum amylase, heartrate, and systolic blood pressure. Conclusions The main clinical indicators of concern included CTnT, RR, SPO2, T, ALB and K. The bagging model and logistic regression model had better diagnostic performance comprehesively. Those may be conducive to the early identification of critical patients with fever by physicians.","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

The French government decided to repatriate the 337 French nationals living in Wuhan and place them in quarantine in their home country. We decided to test them all for SARS-Cov2 twice in order to reduce anxiety among the population and decision-makers. Methods We investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-19 in asymptomatic carriers by testing all repatriated patients within the first 24 h of their arrival in France and at day 5. Viral RNA was extracted from pooled nasal and oropharyngeal swab fluids or sputum in the absence of nasal/oropharyngeal swabs. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was then carried out using several real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays. Results We tested 337 passengers at day 0 and day 5. All the tests for SARS-CoV2 were negative.

Recently, a severe pneumonia-associated respiratory syndrome caused by a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was reported at December 2019 in the city Wuhan, Hubei province, China3, 4, 5, which was also named as pneumonia-associated respiratory syndrome (PARS)6 and can cause coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to seriously endanger human health.

However, the immune mechanism that potential orchestrated acute mortality from COVID-19 patients is still unknown. Here we show that after the SARS-CoV-2 infection, CD4+ T lymphocytes are rapidly activated to become pathogenic T helper (Th) 1 cells and generate GM-CSF etc. The cytokines environment induces inflammatory CD14+CD16+ monocytes with high expression of IL-6 and accelerate the inflammation. Given that large amount of inflammatory cells infiltrations have been observed in lungs from severe COVID-19 patients7, 8, these aberrant pathogenic Th1 cells and inflammatory monocytes may enter the pulmonary circulation in huge numbers and play an immune damaging role to causing lung functional disability and quick mortality. Our results demonstrate that excessive non-effective host immune responses by pathogenic T cells and inflammatory monocytes may associate with severe lung pathology.

The transition from first symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is highly likely to be due to uncontrolled cytokine release. There is an urgent need to identify safe and effective drugs for treatment. Chloroquine (CQ) exhibits a promising inhibitory effect. However, the clinical use of CQ can cause severe side effects. We propose that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which exhibits an antiviral effect highly similar to that of CQ, could serve as a better therapeutic approach. HCQ is likely to attenuate the severe progression of COVID-19, inhibiting the cytokine storm by suppressing T cell activation. It has a safer clinical profile and is suitable for those who are pregnant. It is cheaper and more readily available in China.

The virus has since rapidly spread to all provinces and autonomous regions of China, and to countries outside of China. Patients who become infected with 2019-nCoV may initially develop mild upper respiratory tract symptoms. However, a significant fraction of these patients goes on to subsequently develop serious lower respiratory disease. The effectiveness of adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy uses in the management of 2019-nCoV infected patients with severe lower respiratory tract infections is not clear, and warrants further investigation. METHODS: The present study will be conducted as an open-labelled, randomised controlled trial. We will enrol 48 subjects from Chongqing Public Health Medical Center. Each eligible subject will be assigned to an intervention group (methylprednisolone via intravenous injection at a dose of 1-2mg/kg/day for 3 days) or a control group (no glucocorticoid use) randomly, at a 1:1 ratio. Subjects in both groups will be invited for 28 days of follow-up which will be scheduled at 4 consecutive visit points. We will use the clinical improvement rate as our primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints include the timing of clinical improvement after intervention, duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of hospitalization, overall incidence of adverse events, as well as rate of adverse events at each visit, and mortality at 2 and 4 weeks. DISCUSSION: The present coronavirus outbreak is the third serious global coronavirus outbreak in the past two decades. Oral and parenteral glucocorticoids have been used in the management of severe respiratory symptoms in coronavirus-infected patients in the past. However, there remains no definitive evidence in the literature for or against the utilization of systemic glucocorticoids in seriously ill patients with coronavirus-related severe respiratory disease, or indeed in other types of severe respiratory disease. In this study, we hope to discover evidence either supporting or opposing the systemic therapeutic administration of glucocorticoids in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.

Among the three novel assays, the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay had the lowest limit of detection in vitro (1.8 TCID50/ml with genomic RNA and 11.2 RNA copies/reaction with in vitro RNA transcripts). Among 273 specimens from 15 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Hong Kong, 77 (28.2%) were positive by both the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel and RdRp-P2 assays. The COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay was positive for an additional 42 RdRd-P2-negative specimens [119/273 (43.6%) vs 77/273 (28.2%), P<0.001], including 29/120 (24.2%) respiratory tract specimens and 13/153 (8.5%) non-respiratory tract specimens. The mean viral load of these specimens was 3.21*104 RNA copies/ml (range, 2.21*102 to 4.71*105 RNA copies/ml). The COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay did not cross-react with other human-pathogenic coronaviruses and respiratory pathogens in cell culture and clinical specimens, whereas the RdRp-P2 assay cross-reacted with SARS-CoV in cell culture. The highly sensitive and specific COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay may help to improve the laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19.","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

The absence of a commercial vaccine and the limited success of current therapeutic strategies against RSV make further research necessary. We used a multi-cohort analysis approach to investigate host transcriptomic biomarkers and shed further light on the molecular mechanism underlying RSV-host interactions. We meta-analyzed seven transcriptome microarray studies from the public Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository containing a total of 922 samples, including RSV, healthy controls, coronaviruses, enteroviruses, influenzas, rhinoviruses, and coinfections, from both adult and pediatric patients. We identified &gt; 1500 genes differentially expressed when comparing the transcriptomes of RSV-infected patients against healthy controls. Functional enrichment analysis showed several pathways significantly altered, including immunologic response mediated by RSV infection, pattern recognition receptors, cell cycle, and olfactory signaling. In addition, we identified a minimal 17-transcript host signature specific for RSV infection by comparing transcriptomic profiles against other respiratory viruses. These multi-genic signatures might help to investigate future drug targets against RSV infection.","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

Human coronaviruses (CoVs) are a major cause of respiratory infection and institutional outbreaks, yet the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of these viruses is poorly described among the elderly residing in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). Methods. We performed a retrospective cohort study of LTCF residents with positive nasopharyngeal or mid-turbinate swabs for CoVs (OC43, 229E, NL63 and HKU1) between January 2013 and December 2018. Demographic and clinical data were obtained from resident charts including clinical presentation, treatment, outcome, and transmission to other residents. Variables were compared using univariate analysis. Results. 3268 residents met inclusion criteria (median age 93 years, 90% male) comprising 7.5% (246/3268) of all positive respiratory virus specimens detected during the study period. 97(39%) of cases were associated with a respiratory outbreak while 149(61%) were sporadic cases that did not result in transmission. OC43 (52%) was the most commonly identified CoV and was more commonly associated with outbreak cases (76% vs. 37%; P < 0.001). In total, 87% of all cases had two or more of runny nose/ congestion, cough, sore throat/hoarse voice or fever. The most common symptoms among residents were cough (85%), runny nose/congestion (79%), and sore throat/ hoarse voice (59%) and only 17% of residents had a measured temperature of ≥ 37.8C. Only 6% of residents received antibiotic treatment for suspected secondary bacterial pneumonia. The 30-day mortality rate was 3.7% with 67% of deaths attributable to the CoV infection. There was no statistically significant difference in symptoms, treatment or outcomes associated with outbreaks or seasonality. Conclusion. CoVs make up an important proportion of respiratory viral infections among LTCF residents and may result in frequent outbreaks. Most residents remain afebrile and have self-limited illness while only a small minority develop secondary bacterial pneumonia and death. Given these findings the benefits of control measures should be weighed against the impact on resident quality of life.","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

It has been designed in accordance with CONSORT guidelines. Randomization will be stratified by age (<50 and ‚â•50) and study site. Participants will be healthcare workers at risk for contracting SARS-CoV-2. Participants will be randomized into one of four arms: - Low-dose (300mg chloroquine base weekly); - Medium-dose (300mg chloroquine base twice weekly); - High-dose (150 mg chloroquine base daily); - Placebo. In all treatment arms, an induction dose of 1200mg chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine base (or equivalent number of placebo tablets in the placebo arm) will be taken in 4 divided daily doses (that is 300mg chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine base per day for four days) before starting the low, medium, or high dose regimen . In certain countries (especially where malaria is not endemic), hydroxychloroquine is more readily available and will be used instead of chloroquine. Based on in vitro studies and reviews of drug toxicity , we consider 150mg of hydroxychloroquine base to be equivalent to 150mg of chloroquine base in terms of efficacy. New dosage-based arm(s) might be added or removed. The trial will evaluate which of the intervention arms is most effective at decreasing the incidence of severe COVID-19 disease, without unacceptable side effects or safety events. Participants will complete weekly (smart phone- based) data logs, and follow- up information will be collected until 2 months after enrolment or death. In addition, where possible, we will use telemedicine approaches to collection information on participants. The study flow overview is outlined in Figure 4.

Currently two groups of medicines are hypothesized to be effective therapeutic options in COVID-19: (1) classical antiviral drugs interfering with pathogen dissemination / replication, and (2) compounds inhibiting host inflammatory reactions, especially (and potentially selectively) in respiratory tract / system (cytokine inhibitors and specific antibodies). Special hopes are placed in quinoline derivatives such as chloroquine (CQ), based on some unpublished data from China and a few experiments in vitro. CQ is an old antimalarial drug that has been used for more than 50 years in the therapy and prevention of this parasitosis. Anti-inflammatory features of quinolone derivatives such as CQ or hydroxychloroquine have also been used in rheumatology (for the therapy of lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis) due to the inhibition of the production of proinflammatory cytokines.

These patients often require intubation and ventilator support in order to sustain adequate oxygenation. Once a COVID-19 patient is intubated, Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) is a mainstay of treatment and is used in order to improve lung function, treat underlying atelectasis, improve oxygenation, and improve survival. In fact, early clinical data as well as reports from front line physicians treating COVID-19 suggest that PEEP has been the most effective treatment modality. In many cases, PEEP has resulted in improved oxygenation and improved survival. PEEP decreases the propensity for the alveoli to collapse by increasing the air pressure in the lungs. This residual pressure in the lungs at the end of exhalation decreases shunting and allows for more complete gas exchange and improved oxygenation. In patients, PEEP is one of the safest ways to increase PaO2 and is used on almost all modern ventilator settings. The GO2 PEEP MOUTHPIECE is a simple, comfortable, and straightforward mouthpiece with a bidirectional valve that effectively delivers PEEP with every breath. Early application of the GO2 PEEP MOUTHPIECE in non-intubated COVID-19 patients may improve outcomes and save lives. Furthermore, this device may allow for less strain on limited resources, especially ventilators. This PEEP mouthpiece could be employed under an oxygen non-rebreather mask to improve oxygenation and avoid intubation.","entry_type":"registration","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

More than 400 articles have been published and more than 160 clinical trials are registered but no specific treatment has been successful as of March 2020. Antiviral drugs Lopinavir-Ritonavir did not show any significant benefit compared to standard care in a Chinese randomized controlled study with 199 patients. Even though the overall mortality is low (0.2-7.2% the figures from critical care are fearsome. Mortality rates have been reported as high as 90% in patients developing Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in early reports from the Wuhan province and more recent reports has reported overall 28-d mortality rates of 61,5% in ICU patients with acute respiratory illness (ALI), almost double the mortality of ARDS of any cause. ARDS associated with COVID-19 differs from other described ARDS with rapidly progressing respiratory failure and fibrosis. The mechanism behind the rapid progress is still an enigma but theories have evolved around severe inflammatory involvement with a cytokine storm. Macrophage activation is involved in the early phase of ARDS and cytokine modulators such as Interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitors have been tried in experimental settings but no proper clinical trials have proven positive outcome. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) significantly reduces inflammatory cytokines including IL-1Œ≤, IL-6 and TNF-Œ± through several transcription factors regulating inflammation, including Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 (HIF-1), Nrf2 and NFkB. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) has been used for almost a century, initially for decompression sickness, but it nowadays mainly used for its anti-inflammatory effects. Several randomized clinical trials have been conducted on humans for a variety of inflammatory diseases including diabetic foot ulcers and radiation injury. HBO is generally regarded as safe with very few adverse events. The broad and physiological anti-inflammatory effects of HBO shown in extensive experimental and clinical evidence suggest that HBO is a promising drug to ameliorate ARDS associated with COVID-19.","entry_type":"registration","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

The elevated death risk estimates are probably associated with a breakdown of the healthcare system, indicating that enhanced public health interventions, including social distancing and movement restrictions, should be implemented to bring the COVID-19 epidemic under control.\\\" March 21st 2020 -Much of the United States is currently under some form of self- or mandatory quarantine as testing abilities ramp up.. March 24th, 2020 - Hot spots are evolving and identified, particularly in the areas of New York-New Jersey, Washington, and California Immediate attention is turned to testing, diagnosis, epidemiological containment, clinical trials for drug testing started, and work on a long-term vaccine started. The recovering patients are presenting with mild to severe lung impairment as a result of the viral attack on the alveolar and lung tissues. Clinically significant impairment of pulmonary function appears to be a permanent finding as a direct result of the interstitial lung damage and inflammatory changes that accompanied. This Phase 0, first-in-kind for humans, is use of autologous, cSVF deployed intravenously to examine the anti-inflammatory and structural potential to improve the residual damaged tissues. Previous utilization of cSVF remains in Clinical Trials at this moment for uses in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrotic Lung disorders, showing encouraging safety profile and clinical efficacy. It is the intention of this study, driven by the ongoing pandemic as a direct causative etiology for permanent lung damage within the oxygen/carbon dioxide exchange resulting the the direct alveolar disruption and scarring reaction. The inflammatory mediation, autoimmune modulatory capabilities, and revascularization potentials of the cSVF is becoming well recognized and documented in peer-reviewed literature and in scientific studies. Due to the urgency presented from the ongoing CoronaVirus pandemic, many patients that survive experience demonstrate direct pulmonary damage residua. There is available a relative new technology offered by Fluidda Inc in European Union (EU) known as \\\"Functional Respiratory Imaging (FRI) and examines pulmonary function and vascular capabilities in damaged lung tissues. This study examines the lung baseline (post-infection), and at 3 and 6 month intervals post-cSVF treatment to examine the functional airway configuration and efficiency at those intervals. Sporadic reports of use of stem cells or stem/stromal cells have revealed some positive clinical outcomes, although not within a traditional randomized trial format at this point in time. This study proposed in the specific situation of permanent residual dysfunction created by the SARS-Co2 (Coronavirus) infection is felt to warrant a pilot study using the cSVF that is in current Clinical Trials, which, at this point presents a very good safety profile with the absence of adverse event (AE) or severe adverse events (SAE) as yet reported by the trials.\"","entry_type":"registration","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

This virus family causes upper respiratory tract disease and sometimes severe and fatal lung disease, as in the past: SARS-CoV and -MERS-CoV. Since the outbreak of the pandemic there has been a constant search for effective drug treatment for the disease. Following IN-VITRO evidence of the antiviral effect of CHLOROQUINE in CORONA viruses, this drug has been used empirically for COVID-19 patients and is currently recommended in Israel for the treatment of intermediate and severity disease. Currently, it is not common to treat patients with mild illness or asymptomatic carriers. In these situations, isolation is recommended until upper respiratory tract surfaces no longer show the presence of the virus, a period of approximately 20 days. . The mechanism of action of chloroquine is in part by inhibiting the virus distribution, and changing the intracellular acidity, the virus distribution site. The intracellular chloroquine concentration is determined by a pump called PGP that removes the drug from the cell and is activated by the drug. In the treatment of malaria, the benefit of low dosage of the drug has been shown to be effective due to the fact that the intracellular concentration of the drug is probably higher, and therefore the logic to examine this issue in COVID-19 treatment. The purpose of this study is to test whether a low dose of Chloroquine will reduce the duration of the viral shedding and prevent the disease from worsening. Reducing the duration of viral shedding, shortens the time when there is a risk that the person will spread the disease, and the time when the person is in isolation and cannot return to his normal life. The trial will be conducted in two stages, first in patients with mild-grade symptomatology disease , and then, depending on the results of the first phase, we will condider chloroquine therapy in asymptomatic patients (carriers only) to reduce the duration of viral shedding and prevent the onset of symptomatic disease. (Chloroquine dosage at this stage will be determined by the results of the first stage) In the first stage, patients will be recruited at a slight level and will compare two doses of chloroquine (low and normal) with stadard of care. In the second stage, we plan to examine asymptomatic carriers. Progress between Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the experiment will be contingent upon receiving a renewed approval from the Helsinki Committee, based on an interim report to be submitted. For the first study, patients diagnosed with COVID-19 patients will be recruited in a mild condition, with no background disease or drug therapy that endangers them with the side effects of chloroquine. We will monitor patients' clinical status and periodic PCR results from nasal and pharyngeal surfaces.","entry_type":"registration","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

GMCSF, a pleiotropic cytokine, is an important leukocyte growth factor known to play a key role in hematopoiesis, effecting the growth and maturation of multiple cell lineages as well as the functional activities of these cells in antigen presentation and cell mediated immunity. Leukine inhalation or intravenous administration, as an adjuvant therapy, may confer benefit to patients with ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) due to COVID-19 exposure, who are at significant risk of mortality. While there is no active IND (Investigational New Drug) for Leukine in the proposed patient population, Leukine is being studied in Fase II as an adjuvant therapy in the management of life-threatening infections to boost the hosts innate immune response to fight infection, reduce the risk of secondary infection, and in varied conditions as prevention of infection during critical illness. Inhaled Leukine has also been successfully used as primary therapy to improve oxygenation in patients with disordered gas exchange in the lungs. We propose that based on preclinical and clinical data, Leukine inhalation, as an adjuvant therapy, has an acceptable benefit-risk for use in patients with hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS due to COVID-19 exposure, who are at significant risk of mortality. Confirmed COVID19 patients with hypoxic respiratory failure (saturation below 93% on minimal 2 l/min O2) will be randomized to receive sargramostim 125mcg twice daily for 5 days as a nebulized inhalation on top of standard of care, or to receive standard of care treatment.

This enzyme is responsible to turn angiotensin II into angiotensin1-7. It is also turns angiotensin I into angiotensin 1-9. When ACEII would be blocked by virus level of angiotensin II will be increased and this enzyme along with vasoconstriction, makes cells to manufacture TNF Œ± and IL-6 which are responsible for cytokine storm and Lymphopenia. Also presence of virus and virus shell on the surface of the infected cells make immune system to attack to the respiratory system hence effect of angiotensin II inside the cell causes fibrosis of the respiratory cells. This inflammation and tissue damage make Acute Respiratory Distress syndrome (ARDS) which is lethal for patients. There is a dilemma in treatment of this infection. From one side it doesn't make sense to decrease the immune response hence it will make the infection worse. And from other side stimulation of the immune response because of respiratory inflammation can expedite process of lethal ARDS. A new strategy for treatment of this disease which consists of local anti- inflammatory and systemic immune stimulant drugs can be considered as a reasonable strategy.As immunostimulator, Levamisole can increase Lymphocytes and empower the immunity of the body. This drug can also bind to Papaine Like Protease(PL-pro) of the shell of the virus which is necessary for virulence of COVID-19. It also can decrease level of TNF Œ± and IL-6, and as a chemical adjutant can introduce the virus to the immune system. In addition to Levamisole, Formoterol+Budesonide inhaler can be used in this protocol. Budesonide is a steroid and can suppress the immune reaction locally in the respiratory system. Formoterol is Œ≤2 agonist and can open airways.

Pulmonary infections are the leading causes of ARDS. Clinical and experimental research has established a strong association between dysregulated systemic and pulmonary inflammation and progression or delayed resolution of ARDS. The COVID-19 pandemic is a critical moment for the world. Severe pneumonia is the main condition leading to ARDS requiring weeks of MV with high mortality (40-60%) in COVID-19 patients. There is no specific therapy for Covid-19, although patients are receiving drugs that are already approved for treating other diseases. There has been great interest in the role of corticosteroids to attenuate the pulmonary and systemic damage in ARDS patients because of their potent anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic properties. However, the efficacy of corticosteroids in viral ARDS remains controversial. We justify the need of this study based on the positive results of a recent clinical trial by our group, showing that dexamethasone for 10 days was able to reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) and increase hospital survival in patients with ARDS from multiple causes (Villar J et al. Lancet Respir Med 2020). Dexamethasone has never been evaluated in viral ARDS in a randomized controlled fashion.

According to the WHO, Health-care workers (HCW) face an elevated risk of exposure to - and infection of Covid-19. Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) was developed as a vaccine against tuberculosis, but studies have shown its ability to induce potent protection against other infectious diseases: the so called non-specific effects (NSEs). A favorable in vitro or in vivo effect has been observed in studies for distinct viral pathogens, e.g. respiratory syncytial virus, yellow fever, herpes simplex virus; human papilloma virus. Based on the capacity of BCG to reduce the incidence of respiratory tract infections in children, to exert antiviral effects in experimental models; and to reduce viremia in an experimental human model of viral infection, the hypothesis is that BCG vaccination induces (partial) protection against susceptibility to and/or severity of Covid-19 infection. This study evaluates the efficacy of BCG to improve the clinical course of Covid-19 infection and to prevent absenteeism in order to safeguard continuous patient care. This randomized controlled trial has been designed as a pragmatic study with a highly feasible primary endpoint, which is unplanned absenteeism, that can be continuously measured on a bi-weekly basis). This allows for the most rapid identification of a beneficial outcome that would allow other HCWs to also benefit from the intervention if and as soon as it has been demonstrated to be effective.","entry_type":"registration","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

(1,2) The exacerbated inflammatory response in COVID-19 infected critically ill patients calls for appropriate anti inflammatory therapeutics combined with antiviral effects. Thus, drugs combining anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects may reduce the symptoms of respiratory distress caused by COVID-19. This dual effect may simultaneously protect severely ill patients and reduce the viral load, therefore limiting virus dissemination. Naproxen, an approved anti-inflammatory drug, is an inhibitor of both cyclo oxygenase (COX-2) and of Influenza A virus nucleoprotein (NP). The NP of Coronavirus (CoV), positive-sense single-stranded viruses, share with negative-sense single-stranded viruses as Influenza the ability to bind to- and protect genomic RNA by forming self-associated oligomers in a helical structure with RNA. Naproxen was shown to bind the Influenza A virus NP making electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with conserved residues of the RNA binding groove and C terminal domain. (3) Consequently, naproxen binding competed with NP association with viral RNA and impeded the NP self-association process which strongly reduced viral transcription/replication. This drug may have the potential to present antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2 suggested by modelling work based on the structures of CoV NP. The high sequence conservation within the coronavirus family, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the present SARSCoV-2 coronavirus allows to perform this comparison. (4) A recent clinical trial shown that the combination of clarithromycin, naproxen and oseltamivir reduced mortality of patients hospitalized for H3N2 Influenza infection. (5).

Outbreaks have been reported in more than 50 countries with more than 118,223 confirmed cases and 4,291 deaths worldwide. In Italy, the scenario is progressively worsening with 8514 confirmed cases and 631 deaths at 10/3/2020. Along with the spread of this new virus there has been an increase in the number of pneumonia identified with the term novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (NCIP), which are characterized by fever, asthenia, dry cough, lymphopenia, prolonged prothrombin time, elevated lactic dehydrogenase, and a tomographic imaging indicative of interstitial pneumonia (ground glass and patchy shadows). Recent studies have shown the efficacy of vitamin C and thiamine administration in patients hospitalized for sepsis in the setting of intensive wards in terms of mortality reduction. The use of intravenously vitamin C arises from the experimental evidence of its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Vitamin C causes a greater proliferation of natural killers without affecting their functionality. Moreover, the vitamin C reduces the production of ROS (reactive oxygen species) that contribute to the activation of the inflammosomi and, in particular, the NLRP3 that affetcs the maturation and secretion of cytokines such as IL1beta and IL-18 that are involved in the inflammatory systemic syndrome that characterized sepsis. Vitamin C blocks the expression of ICAM-1 and activation of NFKappaB that are involved in inflammatory, neoplastic, and apoptotic processes by the inhibition of TNFalfa. For this reason, the use of vitamin C could be effective in terms of mortality and secondary outcomes in the cohort of patients with covid-19 pneumonia. In view of the emergency of SARS-VOC-2 and the impossibility of carrying out a randomized controlled study, it is their intention to conduct an intervention protocol (administration of 10 grams of vitamin C intravenously in addition to conventional therapy) involving the cohort of hospitalized patients with covid-19 pneumonia. Methods: An uncontrolled longitudinal study will be conducted at the Arnas Civico-di Cristina-Benfratelli National Relevance Hospital in Palermo. This study will include all patients consecutively hospitalized with positive swab test of SARS-CoV-2 and interstitial pneumonia or with interstitial pneumonia with indication of intubation.

In virological analyses of samples from the patients' deep respiratory tract, a novel coronavirus was isolated (first named 2019-nCoV, then SARS-CoV-2). The disease spread rapidly in the city of Wuhan in early 2020 and soon beyond. On 30 January 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, and on 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the virus a pandemic. In humans, an infection with the virus can cause respiratory infections and even very severe pneumonia, which often ends fatally, especially in old and previously ill patients. Due to the novelty of the virus, the data basis for therapy is very limited. To date, there are no clinical data for an effective specific therapy, nor is there a vaccination against the virus available, so that therapy, especially intensive care treatment for very severe cases, must concentrate only on supportive treatment of lung failure and other complications. The virus is very contagious and infection results in a relevant number of deaths. Due to very uncertain data on the spread of the virus in the population, it is difficult to estimate the mortality rate - case mortality is about 4% based on known case numbers. In reports on the treatment of the first cases in Wuhan (Hubei Province, China) in January 2020, the need for intensive care treatment is described for about a quarter of the inpatient cases, 10-17% had to be ventilated invasively, and venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vv-ECMO) was necessary in 2-4% of the inpatient cases. Patients requiring ECMO have an extremely high mortality rate of 83-100% in the studies described so far. In severe cases a pronounced release of vasoactive cytokines was repeatedly observed. Excessive release of these vasoactive mediators (\\cytokine storm\\\") can result in pronounced vasodilatation and membrane leakage, which can ultimately lead to severe vasoplegic shock that is difficult to control. Ruan et al. and Zhou et al. have identified high interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels as a potential predictor of a fatal outcome when compared between survivors and patients who died of COVID-19 disease. IL-6 is also an important factor in the pathophysiology of severe septic shock and excessive immune response in hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) - for both indications has been shown, that the extracorporeal adsorption of IL-6 and other vasoactive substances in a CytoSorb¬Æ adsorber (CytoSorbents Corporation, Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA) leads to a significant reduction of these cytokines in the patient blood. Clinical experience and (previously unpublished) data from our monocentric registry study show that cytokine adsorption in a CytoSorb¬Æ Adsorber can also be safely integrated into a vv-ECMO system. The aim of the study is to investigate the influence of extracorporeal cytokine adsorption on humoral inflammation parameters and patient survival under controlled conditions in patients with severe COVID-19 disease requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.\"","entry_type":"registration","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

Interventions to decrease the incidence and severity of COVID-19 are emergently needed. Hydroxychloroquine (brand name, Plaquenil), an inexpensive anti-malarial medication with immunomodulatory effects, is a promising therapy for COVID-19. Chloroquine, a related compound with a less favorable toxicity profile, has shown benefit in clinical studies conducted in approximately one-hundred SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. In vitro, hydroxychloroquine has been recently shown to have greater efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 versus chloroquine. Currently, there is no established post-exposure prophylaxis for persons at high risk of developing COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine (brand name, Plaquenil), is a medicine that has been found to be effective against the novel coronavirus in some recent experiments. Previously, hydroxychloquine has been safety used to prevent malaria or to treat autoimmune diseases. This study will test if hydroxychloroquine may be used to prevent the development of COVID-19 symptoms in persons who live with an individual who has been diagnosed with COVID-19. If hydroxychloroquine is shown to reduce the risk of developing symptoms of COVID-19 among people at high risk of infection, this could help to reduce the morbidity and mortality of the COVID-19 epidemic.

Studies indicate that inflammation and cytokine storm might be involved in the pathophysiological pathway to ARDS in these patients. Corticosteroids have been tested in deferent scenarios of ARDS, including viral pneumonia, and the early use of dexamethasone is safe and appears to reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation in ARDS patients. A recent small retrospective study evaluating the role of corticosteroids found no association between corticosteroids and hospital length of stay, virus clearance, and symptoms' duration. However, the retrospective nature of data, small sample size (31 patients), and no protocol for corticosteroids administration undermine its results. Therefore, the present study will evaluate the effectiveness of dexamethasone compared to control (no corticosteroids) in ventilator-free days at 28 days in patients with moderate and severe ARDS due to SARS-CoV2 virus in Brazil.","entry_type":"registration","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

As of March 10, 2020, it had caused more than 160,000 cases of corona virus disease (COVID-19), including more than 6,500 deaths worldwide. France is one of the main epidemic outbreaks with more than 5,000 confirmed cases and the number of diagnosed patients is increasing every day. The number of confirmed paediatric cases is relatively low, and the mortality rate in children is close to zero. This contrast suggests that children are more likely to present pauci-symptomatic or even asymptomatic forms of the disease, which are therefore undiagnosed in most cases. Given the rapid spread of this virus, and the fact that indigenous cases without an obvious chain of transmission now appear to be frequent in France, it is possible that the pauci-symptomatic or asymptomatic child may play a role in the transmission of the pathogen and the dynamics of the epidemic, as documented for other respiratory pathogens such as influenza. Based on this hypothesis, the closure of children's communities has been organized in France and other highly endemic countries.","entry_type":"registration","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

With a 1-sided 5% alpha a fixed sample of 558 patients per group will provide 80% power to reject the null hypothesis of no difference between study groups (PS power and sample size). However, the trial will use an adaptive approach to determine the final sample size. Interim analyses for the primary outcome will be conducted by statisticians with expertise in adaptive design. Patients will be follow-up daily in-hospital. Vital and respiratory signs and symptoms will be captured daily. Electrocardiogram will be performed on day 3 for all patients, with follow-up as required. Adverse effects will be monitored daily and documented, including gastrointestinal symptoms, skin rash or other skin manifestations. If antibiotic treatment will be needed, we will refrain from using azithromycin. Laboratory tests, including complete blood count, electrolytes, creatinine levels, CPK and liver enzymes (including LDH) will be obtained at recruitment if unavailable from the last 24 hours. Blood count, electrolytes and creatinine levels will be repeated on days 5+/-2. Other tests will be performed as clinically indicated. Chest x-ray or other chest imaging will be performed at recruitment if not performed previously and repeated as necessary according to clinical judgment. PCR from respiratory or body samples will be obtained on day 5 (or discharge if prior to day 5) and otherwise as clinically indicated. Blood samples for serology will be taken at recruitment and at day 14 (or at discharge if before day 14). Samples will be frozen and batch analyzed at the end of the study. Patients will not be contacted after discharge, assuming no change in status after discharge (carry-forward assumption). Survival at day 30 will be ascertained using the health ministry records. The data will be entered anonymously into a central case report form (CRF) designed in RedCap. We will document the follow-up, patients' medical treatment, including antiviral, antimicrobial and supportive care and all adverse events. Trial follow-up and monitoring will be performed by The Rambam-Technion ID research using a risk-based monitoring approach with adaptive on-site monitoring. Trial flow and recruitment follow-up: Recruitment reports will be collected monthly, detailing the number of eligible patients, excluded patients, reason for exclusion and number of included patients, in a structured table. The recruitment status vs. expected recruitment rate will be reported monthly, overall and per site. Remote monitoring will be performed continuously throughout the trial to check for data completion and quality. Critical variables will be defined, based on data needed for baseline description of the study cohort, information regarding the intervention and outcome data. Feedback will be provided to local study coordinators via email or telephone. Data will be completed or corrected in real time with the support of the monitoring center. Risk thresholds will be defined for onsite monitoring. Onsite monitoring will be performed periodically and as required following the remote monitoring thresholds. The regular onsite monitoring visits will include: - Inspection of the informed consent forms with dates corresponding to recruitment - Inclusion criteria confirmed vs. patients' charts - Confirmation of primary outcome data in source documents The trial will be followed by an independent data and safety monitoring board and a steering committee. No interim analyses are planned. All serious adverse events will be reported to the independent monitoring board. Interim analyses and serious adverse events will be reported to the local ethics committees, as per local good practice guidelines. The primary analysis will include all randomized patients by intention to treat. A per-protocol analysis will include patients who received the allocated intervention for at least 5 calendar days. Patients' baseline characteristics will be reported as mean with standard deviation, or median with interquartile based on variable distributions. The relative risk for the primary outcome will be computed with 95% confidence intervals. Time dependent variables will be analyzed using Kaplan Meyer curves. The trial will not be powered for subgroup analyses. The study will be approved by the local ethics committees in participating hospitals. Informed consent will be required for participation from the patients or their legal guardians. Owing to severe isolation precautions, a modification to the informed consent process is required. The investigators will present the study drug and related information to the subjects through a phone call. Subjects who agree to participate will sign an informed consent form which will be documented via a video chat. The informed consent process and form will be reviewed by the IRB in order to ensure that the informed consent process is understandable.

As of March 21, 14,469 cases have been confirmed in France, of which 562 have been fatal while 1,525 patients are currently hospitalized in intensive care units. Whereas the pandemic continues to spread, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in 30% of patients (Murthy et al., 2020) with a 30%-60% mortality rate. The main physio-pathological hallmark is an acute pulmonary inflammation. Currently, there is no treatment. The objective of this project is to treat intubated-ventilated patients presenting with a SARS-CoV2-related Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) of less than 96 hours by three intravenous infusions of umbilical cord Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (UC-MSC) one every other day (duration of the treatment: one week). The primary endpoint is the PaO2/FiO2 variation from baseline at day 7. The evolution of several inflammatory markers, T regulatory lymphocytes and donor-specific antibodies will also be monitored. The trial will include 60 patients, of whom 20 will be randomized to cell-treatment administered via intravenous route while the remaining 40 patients will be randomized to receive a placebo solution in addition to the standard of care. Patients will be followed up to 12 months after treatment. State of the art: Mesenchymal stem cells feature several attractive characteristics: ease of procurement, high proliferation potential, capacity to home to inflammatory sites, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and immunomodulatory properties. Their therapeutic benefits have been demonstrated in > 100 animal models, including sheep. Specifically, the therapeutic effects of MSC have been demonstrated in ARDS models induced by H1N1, H5N1, H9N2 influenza virus-associated pneumoniae and were also shown to reduce bacterial-induced acute lung injury in a human model of ex vivo perfused lung (Lee et al., 2013). In the clinics, MSC have demonstrated an excellent tolerance in over 3,000 patients (Thompson et al., 2020), regardless of the dosing and delivery route. Three phase I/II trials have included patients with an ARDS and in one (START II), MSC significantly reduced pulmonary endothelial injury (Matthay et al., 2019). If all MSC share several characteristics regardless of the tissue source, the highest productions of bioactive molecules and the strongest immunomodulatory properties are yielded by those from the Wharton's jelly of the umbilical cord (Romanov et al., 2019) which can be scaled-up to generate banks of cryofrozen and thus readily available products. So far, UC-MSC have been used in a wide variety of diseases (reviewed in Scarfe et al., 2018) and, in most cases, they have been delivered via the intravenous route which is clinically attractive because of its non invasive nature and the subsequent possibility of repeated administrations. Labeling techniques have shown that >80% of intravenously injected MSCs are rapidly trapped in the lungs, followed by a rapid distribution of some of the injected MSCs to other tissues including liver, spleen, and inflammatory or injured sites (Brooks et al., 2018). Over all, these biodistribution patterns have been confirmed by human studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) and/or single‚Äêphoton emission computed tomography (SPECT).2 A four-parameter model (injection rate, clearance rate, rate of extravasation and rate of intravasation) predicts that transplanted MSCs are only therapeutically active for a short period of time (probably less than 24 h) (Parekkadan and Milwid, 2010), a timescale consistent with that of the biological responses that they trigger. These assumptions are an incentive to repeated MSC administrations within a short period of time to induce a sustained therapeutic effect and has rationalized our protocol of injecting MSC one every other day over a one week-period, a design consistent with the earlier report of the benefits of delivering MSC at relatively small doses but in a repeated fashion in patients with graft-versus-host disease (Zhou et al., 2010). Once they have homed in the lungs, MSC have been reported to first induce an inflammatory response which is detectable at the tissue level and systemically (Hoogduijn et al., 2013) and is likely due to their interaction with resident lung cells once they have accumulated in the microvasculature. This initial response is then followed by a downstream phase of reduced immune reactivity (Hoogduijn et al., 2013), the mechanisms of which have been extensively investigated. Thus, 24 hours after their intravenous infusion, most of the UC-MSC that have accumulated in the lungs are dead after their phagocytosis by monocytes and neutrophils which then migrate through the blood stream, particularly in the liver (Leibacher et al., 2017; de Witte et al., 2018). Co-culture experiments have shown that the internalization of MSC fragments by monocytes triggers a phenotypic shift which translates into the upregulation of PD-L1 and CD90 along with an increased expression of mRNA levels for IL-1Œ≤, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 and a decreased expression of TNF-Œ±. Of note, monocytes polarized towards an immune-regulatory phenotype increase the expression of Foxp3+ T regulatory lymphocytes while decreasing that of activated CD4+ cells (de Witte et al., 2018). That apoptosis of intravenously infused MSC is a requirement for their immunosuppressive function is further supported by the observation that the cytotoxic activity against MSC is predictive of clinical responses in patients treated by MSC for graft-versus-host disease, i.e., the best responders are those with high cytotoxicity; in this study, the postulated mechanistic link is that phagocytes that have engulfed apoptotic MSC then produce indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and thus ultimately deliver MSC immunosuppressive activity (Galleu et al., 2017). Given the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV2, it is thus sound to hypothesize that the intravenous administration of UC-MSC during the initial phase of ARDS could control inflammation, accelerate its recovery with improved oxygenation, reduced mechanical ventilation and ventilation weaning time and therefore reduced length of stay in intensive care. This assumption is indeed supported by the recent results of a preliminary Chinese trial in which MSC (the source of which has not be specified) have been reported to improve pulmonary function and symptoms in 7 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia along with a rapid clearance of overactivated cytokine-secreting immune cells (CXCR3+CD4+ T cells, CXCR3+CD8+ T cells, and CXCR3+ NK cells), a decrease in TNF-Œ± circulating levels and an increase in CD14+CD11c+CD11bmid regulatory DC cells and IL-10 levels, compared with a placebo group (Leng et al., 2020).","entry_type":"registration","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

Eligible patients and the next of kin (whenever possible) should be informed about the rationale and the aims of the study and potential risks of drug infusion. Local ethical regulations should be otherwise followed. Due to the eligibility criteria and the urgency setting, a delayed written consent may be obtained after randomization from the next of kin and/or the patient (i.e. after ICU discharge). Randomization will be performed using sealed envelopes with a ratio of 1:1 including information on treatment assignment and a five-digit number, which will be open by the person responsible for drug constitution. Each vial or syringe will be then labeled with the randomly allocated number it will be assigned to the nursing personnel. The doctors and nurses administering the drugs, as well as the local investigators and research personnel who collected data, were unaware of the treatment assignments. Randomization should occur within 24 hours since orotracheal intubation and drug infusion initiated within 4 hours from randomization. Trial will be conducted in adherence to the current Helsinki Declaration and the standard of good clinical practice. Screening of patients will only start after approval of the ethical committees (EC) in the trial sites. No deviation of the protocol will be implemented without the prior review and approval of the ECs. Study Treatment Ang-(1-7) is a pre-constitute intravenous lyophilized formulation containing 0.5 mg/ ampoule and will be administered to patients via a dedicated central venous line at the initial dose of 0.1 mcg/Kg/h (equivalent to 2.5 mcg/Kg/day). After the first hour of infusion, if no decrease in mean arterial pressure (decrease superior to 30% or need to increase vasopressors ‚â• 50% of an initial dosage to maintain a MAP ‚â• 65mmHg), the infusion rate will be increased to 0.2 mcg/Kg/h (equivalent to 5 mcg/Kg/day). The infusion will be continued for up to 48 hours and then stopped. To this end, the substance solution, prepackaged, will be diluted in 1000ml of NaCl 0.9% and then infused using an infusion pump at corresponding speed. The placebo substance, made up of the vehicle alone, will also be intravenously administrated using the same procedure as that for the substance containing the active principle. Patient's management Management of any underlying comorbidity will be at discretion of the attending physicians; the use of international guidelines for the monitoring and the adequate therapeutic interventions are recommended in all patients. In particular, patients ventilation should be managed according to ATS/ESICM/SCCM 2017 consensus for the ventilation in ARDS patients which suggest low tidal volume ventilation (4-8 mL/Kg predicted body weight) associated with low plateau pressure (<30 cmH2O), high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) associated with recruitment maneuvers and prone positioning for periods longer than 12h in severe ARDS patients. Arterial gas analysis assessment should be performed at maximum intervals of six hours or more often according to the attending physician beliefs. Maintenance fluid should be chosen among balanced crystalloids and the quantity will be decided by the attending physician. Glucose management, nutrition protocols, decision to administer neuromuscular blockade, prone positioning, ECMO, nitric oxide or any other adjunctive therapies will be continued according to center current clinical practice and will be recorded in the CRF file. Weaning procedure Regarding the weaning from mechanical ventilation, in order to standardize and reduce bias we will comply with the following procedures based on ARDS Network protocol (ARDSnet). Each day the patients enrolled will be assessed by the medical staff for the following weaning criteria: 1. FiO2 ‚â§ 0.40 and PEEP ‚â§ 8 cmH2O OR FiO2 < 0.50 and PEEP < 5 cmH2O 2. PEEP and FiO2 ‚â§ values of previous day. 3. No neuromuscular blocking agents 4. Patient has acceptable spontaneous breathing efforts (It will be allowed to decrease the respiratory rate on the ventilator up to 50% for 5 min to detect inspiratory effort) 5. Systolic BP ‚â• 90 mmHg If all the above conditions will be met, medical staff will start a spontaneous breathing test (SBT) for up to 120 minutes using one of the following methods and maintaining a: FiO2 ‚â§ 0.5: 1. T-piece Tube 2. Pressure Support Ventilation ‚â§ 5 cmH2O with PEEP ‚â§ 5 cmH2O 3. CPAP with PEEP ‚â§ 5 cmH2O 4. Tracheal Collar mask To test the tolerance at such measures the medical staff will evaluate the following goals for a minimum of 30 minutes up to 120 minutes: 1. SpO2 ‚â• 90% and / or PaO2 ‚â• 60 mm Hg 2. Mean spontaneous tidal volume ‚â• 4 ml/kg PBW (if measured) 3. Respiratory Rate ‚â§ 35 / min 4. pH ‚â• 7.30 (if measured) 5. No respiratory distress (defined as 2 or more of the following): 1. Heart rate ‚â• 120% of the rate (‚â§ 5 min at > 120% may be tolerated) 2. Marked use of accessory muscles 3. Abdominal paradox 4. Diaphoresis 5. Marked subjective dyspnea If all these goals will be met, the medical staff will consider extubation, otherwise the patient will be treated with the pre-weaning settings. Data Collection Data collection on admission will include: demographic characteristics, comorbidities, including use of antihypertensive medications, source of admission, primary and secondary diagnosis, delay since symptoms begin, APACHE II Score (the worst values within the first 24 hours), SOFA score on admission, Chest X-ray and Thoracic CT scan results if available, EKG trace, PaO2/FiO2 on admission. Daily data collection during ICU stay will include: continuous hemodynamic monitoring, including invasive arterial pressure monitoring and continuous EKG; SaO2 and PaO2/FiO2 every 2 hours; blood samples including Hb, glucose and several other chemical variables will be collected at least once per day at 8 am (or the first value of the day); ventilatory parameters and arterial gas analysis will be also collected every six hours; SOFA score; presence of any other documented infection (site, pathogen, treatment); presence of septic shock; daily diuresis and daily total fluid infusion, urine analysis including main electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium) and osmolarity every morning. The occurrence of serious adverse events (see specific paragraph in the text). Duration of ICU stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, need for tracheostomy. In case of death, reasons for withdrawal of care will be recorded. All the data will be recorded using the specific CRF forms, divided into a core section and a daily section and will be uploaded to a web-centralized protected database. Statistical Analysis First phase (Phase IIb) = 15 vs 15 patients Second phase (Phase III) = expected 30 vs 30 patients in total (recalculation of sample size after 15 vs. 15 patients included) The primary outcome of this study is the number of ventilator free days at day 28. Considering an expected median duration of mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 related respiratory insufficiency patients of 14 days, to provide an absolute reduction of 22,5% with an alpha error of 0.05 and to provide a power to detect the effect of 80% and a dropout rate of 3%, 60 patients will need to be included in the primary analysis, 30 in each group. Pre-planned Stratified group analysis will be performed for the following group of patients: 1. History of hypertension vs. no history of hypertension 2. Treatment with ACEi, ARB or DRI drugs vs no treatment 3. Age (<65 vs. ‚â• 65 years) 4. PaO2/FiO2 values at randomization (<100 vs ‚â• 100) 5. Confirmed vs highly suspected COVID-19 Data Safety Management Members of the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) are individuals free of conflicts of interest for this protocol; DSMC will analyze the safety of the study and their membership within the DSMC will be for the duration of this clinical trial. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be recorded at the participating site on the specific CRF and their occurrence will be monitored by the DSMC at the different interim analysis. Formal meeting will be held for each interim analysis to review the data related to the primary outcome, the safety findings as well as the quality of the trial conduct. To enhance the integrity of the trial, the DSMC will have access to the different results aggregated by treatment group and remain unaware of the treatment assignment (the groups will be encoded as A and B). A report including data on recruitment and baseline characteristics and pooled data on eligibility violations will be prepared by the statistician for each DSMC meeting. Only the independent statistician will have access to the whole database. A closed report will be then prepared to allow confidential discussion of clinical data and the DSMC has to prepare minutes of their meetings, with a list of recommendations for the Steering Committee (to continue, to hold or to terminate the trial). If the recommendation is to stop the trial, a final decision will be made after the analysis of all patients included at the time (including patients randomized after data collection for the DSMC meeting). The Steering Committee will be responsible for deciding whether to continue, hold or stop the trial based on DSMC recommendations. The DSMC will be notified of all changes to the trial protocol or conduct. Organization Data will be recorded using pre-printed CRF by the attending physician or a trained research nurse. All data will be periodically introduced by trained personnel in the central web-based database. The study coordinator will contact each time a patient is included the local PI to ensure data collection and reporting as well as completion of patient follow-up or on premature termination of the study protocol. The individual data provided by a participating ICU are primarily property of the ICU who generated the data. All investigators have the right to access their data every time. The Principal Investigators of the study have the responsibility to perform periodic and spot checks visits to monitor the progress of the clinical study. Completed CRFs will be reviewed for completeness, compliance with investigation plan and appropriate device use and accountability. Case report forms will be uploaded on a website with the help of an independent statistician, which will be overseen data entry and data quality management. Data on safety will be provided to the DMSC with regular time intervals. The steering committee will review study integrity, safety and risk/benefit issues after 25 included patients. The rate of these reviews could increase according to report of relevant safety issues. Independent analyses of serious adverse events will be performed and adjudicated if the frequency or nature of serious adverse events warrants it.","entry_type":"registration","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

Preliminary evidence, indeed, point out the efficacy of an IL-6 receptor inhibitor in improving clinical conditions in a proportion of rapidly deteriorating patients. Our hypotesis is that a precocious inhibition of IL-6 signal, by the administration of tofacitinib (JAK 1/3 Inhibitor), could hinder the progression to more severe grades of lung inflammation leading to pulmonary function deterioration. In a prospective single cohort open study, 50 patients admitted in Hospital due to SARS-CoV 2 symptomatic interstitial pneumonia, but not requiring mechanical ventilation, will be enrolled.

The COVID-19 public health crisis requires the full resources and attention of healthcare systems. This has led to several healthcare changes that affect obstetrics and gynecology patients, including delays and cancellations in elective surgery, visitor restrictions, and transitioning from in person outpatient visits to telemedicine visits. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) joined with several other OB/Gyn societies to announce their joint statement on March 16th, 2020 to reduce the number of elective surgeries in OB/Gyn to free up healthcare resources. Hospitals and outpatient clinics are instituting visitor restrictions. Specifically, at Banner University Medical Center - Phoenix (BUMCP), they are not allowing any visitors with the exception of one visitor for an obstetric laboring patient or for pediatric patients. All \\non-essential\\\" OB and Gyn visits are transitioning to telemedicine visits through the telephone or video conferencing platforms, with the exception of obstetric visits that require labs, vitals, or fetal assessments. These healthcare changes to OB/Gyn patients is likely impacting their level of stress. Evidence-based interventions for stress include cognitive behavior therapy, although this can be time consuming, requires the need for specialized providers, and is not feasible for all patients during this COVID-19 pandemic. Pharmacotherapy can be used, including antidepressants and anxiolytics, however they have inherent limitations such as side effects, tolerance, and interactions that limit their use. Consumer based mobile applications (apps) may help individuals with self-management strategies for stress (1). Mindfulness meditation is one type of self-management strategy and is the practice of moment-to-moment awareness in which the person purposefully focuses on the present without judgement (1,2). \\\"Calm\\\" is a mindfulness meditation mobile app that offers a range of mindfulness meditation practice guide modules that vary in length, instruction, and content. The app includes meditation lessons, sleep stories (bed-time stories for grown-ups), sleep music, and nature sounds. Few studies on the use of \\\"Calm\\\" exist and include a randomized controlled trial evaluating its affect to decrease stress among college students and a descriptive study evaluating cancer patient's perceptions of the app (1,3). There is limited literature on the effects of mindfulness meditation in obstetrics and gynecology and include its effects on postoperative pain, infertility, and painful bladder (4-6). During these unprecedented times of the COVID-19 pandemic, mindfulness meditation mobile apps such as Calm may be potentially beneficial to help with stress in OB/Gyn patients, although this requires further investigation. The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of the mindfulness meditation app \\\"Calm\\\" on stress, anxiety, and sleep in outpatient obstetrics and gynecology patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants will be randomized to two groups; Arm 1 receives a 30 day free trial at the start of the study, Arm 2 receives a 30 day free trial at the conclusion of the study. All participants will complete a baseline survey on perceived stress, anxiety, and sleep at the start of the study, again at 2 weeks into the study, and again one month later. The investigator's primary objective is to evaluate perceived stress (validated Perceived Stress Scale) with use of the mindfulness meditation app, \\\"Calm,\\\" among outpatient OB/Gyn patients during COVID-19 pandemic. The investigator's secondary objectives are to evaluate anxiety (validated Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and sleep (validated PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Short Form) with use of the mindfulness meditation app, \\\"Calm,\\\" among outpatient OB/Gyn patients during COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the investigators want to assess feasibility with using the app which includes measurements of adherence and participant satisfaction with use of the app.\"","entry_type":"registration","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

Most of the time they depend on mechanical ventilation support due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Infection rates are higher than the capacity for intensive care, which represents a serious problem in medical care. Around 20% of those infected have severe pneumonia and so far it does not have a specific therapy, or even, an effective clinical management. Therapeutic options using malaria drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have shown promising results in vitro and in vivo test. A recent, small, non-randomized study with hydroxychloroquine in 36 patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 proved to be promising in the ability to reset the viral load in 6 days after starting treatment.

Hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir and other antiviral medications are currently under research investigations. Natural honey has been well known for its high health properties in diabetes, nutrition, dyslipidemia, skin lesions and it got FDA approval for topical wound treatment in 2007 as the most potent antimicrobial agent. Honey has been previously considered as an alternative for acyclovir in the treatment of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and it also demonstrated for its significant antiviral effect against varicella zoster virus (VZV). Many studies have demonstrated the broad spectrum antimicrobial effect of honey as an antibacterial, anti fungal, antiviral and antimycobacterial. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the Public Health England (PHE) guidelines recommended honey as a first line of treatment for acute cough caused by upper respiratory tract infection which is currently a cornerstone symptom in COVID-19 infectious disease. Moreover, natural honey should no longer be used as \\alternative\\\" and deserves to gain more attention by scientists and researchers. The aim of this trial is to study the efficacy of natural honey in treatment of patients infected with COVID-19 in comparison with current standard care. Methods: This will be a randomized , multi center, double armed clinical trial, patients will be randomly assigned to two groups on 1:1 basis.

In addition, isolation at home puts another kind of pressure (psychic in essence) on the patients who are also suffering from the mentioned chronic pathology. These patients bring the stress of isolation in relation to their own person, family / contacts, but also with the medical team in possible digital / wireless contact. At this time, there are no management protocols for patients with such a degree of complexity, the telemetry problem being only isolated, as far as local resources and specific objectives are concerned, in no case viewed in their entirety. The major problem that arises with the isolation of these patients is that they cannot be admitted to hospitals for problems of low severity compared to the current territorial capacities, and at the same time, they cannot be left unattended - by abolishing / blocking the medical activity in the specialized outpatient clinics. . It cannot be said that there is similar experience with the current epidemiological situation and there are no Guides or directions of institutionalized medical practice. This particular situation more likely makes experts to witness an increase in the complications of cardiovascular diseases through the lack of direct management (heart failure compensations), early and long-term complications of tension jumps or uncontrolled tension values, and possibly acute coronary syndromes). Moreover, the coronary patients who are instrumented by stenting, see the impossibility to come to the periodic checks at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and one year after the coronary stenting, as there is no alternative solution to the closure of the outpatients.

The World Health Organization launched a simple,pragmatic worldwide open-label trial to test Remdesivir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Interferon and Hydroxychloroquine or Chloroquine.The most important complication of COVID-19 severe cases is respiratory failure from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the leading cause of mortality. Accumulating evidence suggests that patients with severe COVID-19 might have a cytokine storm syndrome, a hyperinflammatory syndrome characterized by a fulminant and fatal hypercytokinemia and multiorgan failure. The proposed pathophysiological mechanism of cytokine storm and inflammatory cascade activation is based on evidence collected primarily during the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics (with a significant increase in IL1B, IL6, IL12, IFNŒ≥, IP10, TNFŒ±, IL15, and IL17 among others). The data collected during the pandemic with COVID-19 also shows a significant increase in inflammatory cytokines (GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFŒ±, among others) in sicker patients admitted to intensive care. In the absence of effective treatments for the management of patients with COVID-19 and respiratory failure, the immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effect of colchicine on cytokines involved in the hyper-inflammatory state is postulated. Several lines of research worldwide are testing powerful anti-inflammatory drugs for the pandemic, with different options including steroids, cytokine blockers, and other potent anti-inflammatory agents. Steroids are partially contraindicated in viral infections. Colchicine is a powerful anti-inflammatory drug approved for the treatment or prevention of gout and Familial Mediterranean Fever at doses ranging between 0.3 mg and 2.4 mg/day. Its mechanism of action is through the inhibition of tubulin polymerization, as well as through potential effects on cellular adhesion molecules and inflammatory chemokines. It might also have direct anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting key inflammatory signalling networks known as inflammasome and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, evidence suggests that colchicine exerts a direct anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the synthesis of tumor necrosis factor alpha and IL-6, monocyte migration, and the secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-9. Through the disruption of the cytoskeleton, colchicine is believed to suppress secretion of cytokines and chemokines as well as in vitro platelet aggregation. All these are potentially beneficial effects that might diminish or ameliorate the COVID-19 inflammatory storm associated with severe forms of the disease. Importantly, in one contemporary trial low-dose colchicine administered to patients who survived from acute coronary syndrome shows a statistically significantly reduction of cardiovascular complications. We have therefore designed in a simple, pragmatic randomized controlled trial to test the effects of colchicine on severe hospitalized COVID-19 cases with the aim of reducing mortality.","entry_type":"registration","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

Participants will complete a basic demographics survey and preoperative/ baseline patient reported outcome surveys at enrollment, including the Patient-reported outcomes measurement information system (PROMIS) Pain Intensity 1A short form, PROMIS Pain Intensity 3A short form, PROMIS Pain Interference 8A short form, and PROMIS 8A Emotional Distress-Anxiety 8A short forms. Following completion of these surveys, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio using a random number generator into one of two study groups. The intervention group will receive mobile messages communicating the behavior intervention. The control group will not receive the intervention. Subjects will not be blinded to their study group. Participants randomized to the intervention group were subsequently enrolled into the automated mobile messaging protocol and received a confirmation message welcoming them to the study, which was reviewed with them by the research assistant. Subjects were instructed that they were only required to read all messages, no responses were required. A single instance of follow-up will take place on Day 14 of the study. This will occur over the phone with a research team member. Subjects will fill out a second set of the patient reported outcome surveys completed at enrollment. Collection of these followup items marks the end of the subject's participation in the study. No data collection is planned following the two week study period. The study hypothesis is that subjects receiving the behavior intervention delivered via an automated mobile messaging robot would demonstrate better patient reported outcome survey scores than controls at follow-up.","entry_type":"registration","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

The burden of sepsis is increasing worldwide. It is the cause of 8 million global deaths each year. Currently, treatment options are limited to antimicrobials and supportive care such as intravenous fluids, vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, and renal replacement therapy. In the absence of effective therapies specifically targeting the dysregulated immune response, prolonged use of these life-sustaining therapies can be debilitating. A growing body of evidence suggesting that vitamin C, an inexpensive and readily available intervention, is potentially lifesaving in sepsis. Intravenous vitamin C may be the first therapy to mitigate the dysregulated cascade of events that leads to sepsis. If proven effective, vitamin C could be used worldwide and drastically change outcomes in high- and low-income settings alike. Objectives. To determine whether intravenous vitamin C, compared to placebo, reduces mortality and morbidity in sepsis (induced by bacterial and viral pathogens (as COVID-19)), and compare clinical and biochemical measures of organ dysfunction, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) at 6 months. To ascertain the volume of distribution, clearance, and plasma concentration over a course of 96 hours of intravenous vitamin C 50 mg/kg of weight every 6 hours or matching placebo (pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy). Methods. Patients will be randomly assigned to vitamin C (intravenous, 50 mg/kg every 6h) or placebo (0.9% NaCl or dextrose 5% in water) for 96 hours. Study personnel at the clinical sites will document the composite of death or persistent organ dysfunction at day 28. Daily assessments will occur for organ function, on days 1, 3, 7 for inflammation, infection, and endothelial injury biomarkers, at baseline for vitamin C level, and at 6 months for mortality and HRQoL. The LOVIT Trial will be conducted in adult general Canadian and international intensive care units. For the PK substudy: Blood samples will be drawn around the 6th dose (second dose on day 2) at time 0 and then after administration at times 1h, 2h, 4h and 6h (the 6h level will be immediately prior to the next dose). The PK substudy will be conducted with 100 participants in 3 of the 25 participating centers. Relevance. In the context of increasing off-label use of vitamin C for sepsis and ongoing trials of vitamin C bundled with other pharmacological interventions, the LOVIT Trial will constitute a rigorous assessment of the effect of vitamin C monotherapy on patient-important outcomes.","entry_type":"registration","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) has shown its efficacy in the treatment of behavior disorders. Objective: This study aims to evaluate an online mindfulness-based brief intervention skill named \\STOP touching your face\\\" in reducing face-touching behavior. Methods: This will be a single-blind, randomized, controlled, trial. The investigators will recruit 4,000 participants, and will randomize and allocate participants 1:1 to the \\\"STOP touching your face\\\" intervention group (n=2000) and the control group (n=2000). All participants will be asked to monitor and record their face-touching behavior. The intervention group will receive the brief online mindfulness-based \\\"STOP touching your face\\\" program, and the control group will receive control intervention. Primary outcome will be the efficacy of short-term mindfulness-based \\\"STOP touching your face\\\" intervention for reducing the frequency of face-touching. The secondary outcomes will the reduction of the duration of face-touching after intervention; the association between the psychological traits of mindfulness and face-touching behavior; and the differences of face-touching behavior between left-handers and right-handers. Results: The investigators will recruit 4000 participants from March to April 2020 or until the recruitment process is complete. The follow-up will be completed in April 2020. The investigators expect all trial results to be available by the end of April 2020. Conclusions: This is the first RCT to evaluate the efficacy of brief mindfulness intervention to reduce face-touching behavior. The investigators expect that \\\"STOP touching your face\\\" has a significantly greater reduction of frequency of face-touching behavior than the control intervention. As \\\"STOP touching your face\\\" is a brief and simple skill, the public health impact of its expansion into world-wide could be enormous, which will greatly help us coping with any face-touching spread infectious diseases, like COVID-19.\"","entry_type":"registration","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

One exception is a brief 6-hr dissonance-based program (Project Health) wherein participants make small lasting incremental lifestyle changes to dietary intake and exercise to reach energy balance, and discuss costs of obesity, an unhealthy diet, and sedentary behavior, and benefits of leanness, a healthy diet, and exercise, which prompts them to align their attitudes with their publically displayed behavior. These activities promote the internalization of health goals and executive control over lifestyle behaviors. Late adolescents randomized to Project Health showed fewer increases in BMI and a 41% and 43% reduction in overweight/obesity onset over 2-yr follow-up compared to a version of the program lacking dissonance induction activities and an obesity education condition. Project Health appears to be the first program to produce these key obesity prevention effects relative to an alternative intervention, but it is critical to increase effects. A dissonance-based prevention program was more effective when implemented in single- versus mixed-sex groups, theoretically, because it promoted greater participation in dissonance-inducing discussions. Aim 1a is to test whether the weight gain prevention effects will be larger when Project Health is implemented in single-sex groups; we will randomize 450 17-20-year-olds to complete Project Health in female, male, or mixed-sex groups, assessing outcomes at pretest, posttest, and 6, 12, 24, and 36-month follow-ups. Aim 1b is to test whether greater participation in dissonance-inducing discussions and group cohesion mediate the effect of condition on any superior weight gain prevention effects. Adolescents who show greater fMRI-assessed reward and attention region responsivity to food images exhibit elevated future weight gain, implying that reducing this responsivity may reduce future weight gain. In a pilot trial, late adolescents who completed go/nogo, stop-signal, and respond-signal computer training in which they repeatedly inhibit responses to high-calorie foods and respond to low-calorie foods, and dot-probe and visual-search computer tasks that train attention away from high-calorie foods and to low-calorie foods, showed a greater reduction in reward and attention region responsivity to, palatability rating of, and willingness to pay for, high-calorie foods, suggesting reduced valuation and attentional bias, as well as greater fat loss over 1-yr follow-up versus controls who completed the training with non-food images. Aim 2a is to test whether adding food response and attention training to Project Health will produce larger weight gain prevention effects. Participants in the 3 conditions will be randomized to complete response and attention training for 25-mins after each of the 6-sessions with either food or non-food images. Aim 2b is to test whether reduced palatability ratings of, willingness to pay, and attentional bias for high-calorie foods mediate the effect of training condition on any superior weight gain prevention effects. During the COVID-19 shelter-at-home order, we will not measure in person only outcomes including BodPod assessments, and height and weight measurement for BMI calculation for all participants that have assessments due during this order. We will continue to conduct intervention groups that will be administered on a virtual platform.","entry_type":"registration","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false}
