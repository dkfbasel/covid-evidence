Participants will be randomised using online software (where good sleepers will be randomised to treatment or no treatment).<br>","country":"United Kingdom","status":"recruiting","out_primary_measure":"Insomnia severity measured using the Insomnia Severity Index at one week post-intervention","start_date":"06/04/2020","title":"Testing an early online intervention for the treatment of disturbed sleep during the COVID-19 pandemic (Sleep COVID-19)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ","entry_type":"registration","url":"http://isrctn.com/ISRCTN43900695"},

It is expected that this study will not require individual patient consent. This study is in effect a large-scale clinical audit during a global health emergency, as all data is already recorded as part of routine clinical care, therefore justifying participant enrolment using a waiver of consent. Retrospective data will be sourced from all collaborating hospitals across Australia from January 2020 to March 2020. Whereas, international hospitals will provide their retrospective data between January 2019 and march 2020. Prospective data will be collected in Australian and International hospitals until completion of COVID-19 global epidemic, as judged by the World Health Organization. The total duration of observation per participant will be until hospital discharge or 28 days post intensive care unit admission, whichever comes first. The study will combine prospective observation, and retrospective observations sourced from clinical charts. <br>","country":"Australia;Hong Kong;Taiwan, Province Of China;Indonesia;Korea, Republic Of;Japan;Italy;Singapore;Viet Nam;Thailand;United Kingdom;United States of America","status":"recruiting","out_primary_measure":"Mortality<br>[At hospital discharge or 28 days post intensive care unit admission, whichever comes later. ]","start_date":"05/03/2020","title":"ExtraCorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for 2019 novel Coronavirus Acute Respiratory Disease (COVID-19)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://anzctr.org.au/ACTRN12620000421932.aspx"},

The helmet will be connected to oxygen and room air flow meter to deliver a minimum of 60L of fresh gas flow and a PEEP valve. The PEEP will be increased using a PEEP valve in increments of 2-3 cmH20 to improve peripheral oxygen saturation of at least 90% at an inspired oxygen requirement (FiO2) of ≤ 60%.14 After application of the helmet, arterial blood gas sampling will be utilized to follow gas-exchange; this is a part of usual care for the management of patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Noninvasive support will be reduced progressively in accordance to clinical improvement and will be discontinued if patient maintains respiratory rate <30breaths/min and PaO2 >75mm Hg with FiO2 0.5 without ventilatory support. If endotracheal intubation is required, the helmet will be removed and the patient will be intubated without delay.\n\nControl: Usual Care Patient randomized to the control group will continue invasive mechanical ventilation until the following weaning criteria are met:15 Resolution or improvement of the condition leading to intubation Hemodynamic stability, defined as systolic blood pressure between 90 and 160 mm Hg and heart rate less than 140/min without vasopressors or with low doses of vasopressors Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13 or greater Respiratory stability (oxygen saturation >90% with fraction of inspired oxygen [Fio2] ≤0.4, respiratory rate <35/min, Noncopious secretions (<3 aspirations in the last 8 hours).\n\nOnce weaning criteria are met, patients will undergo a spontaneous breathing trial for 30 minutes on pressure support mode. Criteria for failure to tolerate the SBT were agitation, anxiety, low level of consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale score <13), respiratory rate higher than 35/min and/or use of accessory muscles, oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry less than 90% with Fio2 higher than 0.5, heart rate higher than 140/min or greater than a 20% increase from baseline, systolic blood pressure lower than 90 mm Hg, or development of arrhythmia. If the spontaneous breathing trial is successful, then the patient will be extubated.\n\nSubjects will be followed for long term followup at 90 day and 1year mortality","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04349332"},

These changes may cause some problems. For women who perceive menopause as the first step of old age, loss of physical strength, energy, attraction and fertility, menopause can also lead to anxiety. In addition to these, they are among the emotional changes in the menopausal period in symptoms such as hypersensitivity to events, fatigue, and insomnia. Sometimes it can even be seen in psychological disorders such as melancholy and depression.

This virus resulted in a total of 1679720 confirmed cases and 101734 deaths worldwide. All countries in the world are taking some precautions to prevent the spread of this epidemic disease, which World Health Organization (WHO) declared as \"epidemic\". Staying home and social isolation are among these precautions. For this purpose, it began to implement the curfew for all individuals on 10 March 2020, Turkey. However, not leaving the house and social isolation bring about the limitation of physical activity. Physical activity (PA) is defined as anybody's movement produced by WHO by contraction of skeletal muscles. Studies investigating the relationship between social isolation and health behavior report consistent findings. Individuals with smaller social networks report less healthy diets, excessive alcohol consumption, and less physical activity. Traditional exercises; It takes place outdoors in gyms or rehabilitation centers. However, with the increase in the time we spent at home due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic, technologies have been used as an alternative method. Home-based exercise programs are also a viable solution to prevent various health problems that may be encountered in this direction. The decrease in physical performance is associated with loss of muscle strength, low quality of life, emotionalization, comorbidity, premature death, and increased health costs. When today's conditions are evaluated, technology-supported education programs are effective in increasing motivation for physical support. The purpose of this study; To prevent the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, to evaluate the physical activity levels of individuals between the ages of 18-40 who have social isolation due to the measures taken in our country and to investigate the effectiveness of their video-based exercises.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nSedentary life invites various diseases. Especially cardiovascular diseases are the leading ones. Researches show that the rapid development of technology has pushed people to laziness and therefore to immobility. A sedentary lifestyle causes many serious health problems. Many diseases such as obesity and cardiovascular diseases, which are characterized as contemporary diseases, such as muscular weakness, postural disorder, and diabetes are more common in immobile and sedentary individuals.\n\nWe know that still life has some drawbacks. These may cause tissue injuries between the vertebrae and kyphosis, lordosis, scoliosis problems, respectively. It may also cause calcification in the lumbar vertebrae, disc problems, risk of sciatica, and an increase in excess adipose tissue under the skin. Again high blood cholesterol and triglyceride findings and blood sugar abnormalities may occur in the blood table. Of course, the susceptibility to high blood pressure, the loss of elasticity of the rib cage, low respiratory capacity, and the risk of coronary vascular disease may be uncertain. Still life can create weak abdomen and back muscles, posture disorder, digestive and excretion difficulties, postpartum drooping abdomen, hip slope abnormality, loss of strength, flexibility and functionality in all muscle and muscle groups, weight problem and formlessness. Also in skeleton structure; osteoporosis, calcification, joint problems, easy injury, weak body, easy sickness and recovery can be observed. All these diseases are serious health problems that can be encountered in individuals who do not exercise regularly. In many developed countries of the world, people have included sports in many compulsory habits such as eating, drinking, lying, education, and worship. This compulsory exercise is a lifelong activity in humans. People who make it compulsory to exercise will feel discomfort as soon as they do not.\n\nAt the moment, we know that the most valid method to protect against coronavirus is to stay at home. Many scientists are told that this virus protection is to strengthen the immune system through exercise, and that the weight problem can be eliminated with exercise due to staying at home all day long. Because, it is explained one by one that exercise will increase the body resistance of the people, children and adults will stay away due to movement from obesity, the skeletal-muscular system will be regular, and the social environment will make people healthier.\n\nIn addition, constant home, restricted mobility and freedom, limited sociability, decreased communication, increased social-physical distance with our loved ones, and decreased physical contact can make us more depressed, angry and anxious.\n\nFor all these reasons, the home quarantine process created due to the Corona virus necessitates exercise. We believe that this process can be managed in the most effective way with video exercise and information booklets in order to reduce inactivity in this process, which is left at home with the philosophy of life is movement, movement is life.\n\nScience and technology have been developing since the day human beings existed. Technology; It is used in many fields such as education, health, communication, defense, industry and transportation. Technology has brought many benefits and a new perspective to the health sector as well as other fields. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the effects of the exercise program that we applied remotely with video-based exercises during the quarantine days on the parameters such as physical activity level, balance, endurance, sleep quality, depression, anxiety and quality of life.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04346966"},

Hypertension and cardiovascular disease are risk factors for death in COVID-19. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an important component of the renin-angiotensin system, serves as the binding site of SARS-CoV-2 and facilitates host cell entry in the lungs. In experimental models, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been shown to increase ACE2 expression in several organs, potentially promoting viral cell invasion, although these findings are not consistent across studies. Alternatively, ACEIs and ARBs may actually improve mechanisms of host defense or hyperinflammation, ultimately reducing organ injury. Finally, ACEIs and ARBs may have direct renal, pulmonary and cardiac protective benefits in the setting of COVID-19. Therefore, it is unclear if ACEIs and ARBs may be beneficial or harmful in patients with COVID-19. Given the high prevalence of hypertension, cardiovascular and renal disease in the world, the high prevalence of ACEIs or ARBs in these conditions, and the clinical equipoise regarding the continuation vs. discontinuation of ACEIs/ARBs in the setting of COVID, a randomized trial is urgently needed.

The World Health Organization (WHO) designated the respiratory disease as coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on February 12, 2020. Numerous reports have since characterized the COVID-19 clinical syndrome, ranging from asymptomatic/mild disease to severe disease leading to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation (i.e., ARDS, multi-organ failure, sepsis, and death).\n\nA safe, effective, and inexpensive therapy is urgently needed, one that can alter the natural course of the disease process and reduce strain on healthcare systems. High Dose Intravenous Vitamin C is a safe and possibly effective treatment for ARDS and has been described to be effective for ARDS of viral origin.\n\nA double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized control trial from our institution involving 167 patients with ARDS who were randomized to receive 50 mg/kg every 6 hours of HDIVC for 4 days versus placebo showed a statistically significant difference in 28-day all-cause mortality. The 28-day mortality was 29.8% in the vitamin C group versus 46.3% in the placebo group, although this was a secondary outcome.\n\nThis can be translated as a Number Needed to Treat (NNT) of 6-8 patients to save one life from ARDS. The statistical effect on mortality remained up to 60-days following trial completion.\n\nWe, therefore, cannot withhold the treatment from patients with ARDS. It remains unknown if HDIVC given early can prevent the progression to ARDS and if it is effective in COVID-19 ARDS.\n\nThe first study, published in 1986, treated 16 ARDS patients with intravenous vitamin C (1000 mg IV every 6 hours) plus antioxidants versus 16 ARDS patients who received the standard care at that time (i.e., control group). There was a reduction in mortality in the vitamin C group: 37% versus 71% in the standard care group (p<0.01). A phase I trial in 2014 proved that plasma vitamin C in patients with severe sepsis and ARDS were low, almost at scorbutic levels and that HDIVC administration had a dose-dependent effect in the prevention of multi-organ failure, as measured by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores.\n\nPatients who received a total of 200 mg/kg/day of HDIVC for 4 days (administered in 50 mg/kg/dose, every 6 hours), had significantly lower organ failure scores than placebo, and even lower scores than the patients who received lower-doses of IV vitamin C (50 mg/kg/day administered at 12.5 mg/kg/dose, every 6 hours for 4 days). In this trial, the patients in the HDIVC group (200 mg/kg/day) achieved plasma levels up to 3,000 µM on day 4.\n\nTo assess the treatment effect of a 72-hour intravenous vitamin C infusion protocol (100 mg/kg every 8 hours) in patients with hypoxemia and suspected COVID-19 (Novel Coronavirus ID-19). In the course of performing this phase 2 trial we will explore three following hypotheses:\n\nPrimary Endpoint: HDIVC infusion will increase 28-day ventilator-free days. Secondary Endpoint A: HDIVC infusion will reduce 28-day all-cause hospital mortality.\n\nSecondary Endpoint B: HDIVC infusion will significantly increase acute inflammation-free days (defined as CRP >=10 mg/L) among COVID-19 patients.\n\nSecondary Endpoint C: HDIVC infusion will be safe, as demonstrated by organ-failure-free days up to 28 days.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04344184"},

All the countries of the world take some precautions to prevent the spread of this epidemic disease, which WHO declared as \"pandemic\". Apart from compulsory situations, non-home and social isolation are the primary measures. However, not leaving the house and social isolation brings with it the restriction of physical activity.\n\nAccording to World Health Organization (WHO), in order to obtain health benefits, adult individuals between the ages of 18-64 should perform at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week (30 minutes a day for 5 days a week) or intensive physical activity for at least 75 minutes a week. For additional health benefits, adults should increase their moderate-intensity physical activities to at least 300 minutes a week or equivalent. Physical activity; It is directly related to the prevention of chronic diseases, increasing fitness, strengthening the muscles and increasing the quality of life. It is reported that one of the ten main risk factors in terms of mortality in the world is insufficient physical activity. The effects of social isolation are related to physical inactivity, smoking and the possibility of having both health risk behaviors together. Practical and innovative interventions are needed to reduce physical performance and decrease in muscle mass, strength and physical performance in the aging population. Considering today's conditions and current COVID-19 Pandemic, technology-supported exercise programs are effective in increasing the motivation for physical activity. The purpose of this study; In order to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, social isolation, which is one of the measures taken in our country, is to evaluate the physical activity level of adults and to investigate the effectiveness of home exercises.

SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and may lead to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome in affected individuals. No therapeutic intervention has yet been approved for COVID-19, and initial interventional studies with single agents showed only minimal improvement in outcome or were not convincing in design. Therefore, the CLOCC trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of a combination therapy consisting of hydroxychloroquine, which was used already as single agent with some effect, together with camostat mesylate in hospitalized patients with moderate COVID-19 infection. The rationale for this combination therapy stems from the observation that hydroxychloroquine interferes with viral entry and replication through several mechanisms including changes in endosomal pH and in glycosylation of the ACE2 receptor, which serves as entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Camostat acts as inhibitor of the host cell serine protease TMPRSS2, which is needed to prime the viral S protein for cell entry. Participants will be recruited in a total of 6 German centers, and the trial will be randomized (1:1) and enrolled in either the hydroxychloroquine + placebo or the hydroxychloroquine + camostat arm (7-day treatment). The trial will be carried out in a double-blinded fashion. The primary efficacy outcome is the number of patients discharged by day 14 (status 1 and 2 of a 7-point ordinal clinical status scale).

We hypothesize that dexamethasone (20 mg for 5 days followed by 10 mg for 5 days) combined with 600 mg per day dose of hydroxychloroquine for 10 days will reduce the 28-day mortality compared to hydroxychloroquine alone in patients with severe ARDS related COVID-19.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic causing COVID-19 disease affects hundreds of thousands of patients. Of these, 5% will present with acute respiratory failure, the most severe form of which is Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Hospital mortality affects 45% of patients with severe ARDS. The improvement in mortality associated with ARDS seems largely explained by the reduction in lesions induced by mechanical ventilation, in particular a tidal volume (Vt) set at 6 ml / kg of the weight predicted by the size associated with a plateau pressure must not exceed 30 cm of water. Unfortunately and despite the application of these recommendations, ARDS related COVID-19 is associated with a mortality of 65%. About 42% of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonitis will develop ARDS and the onset of ARDS is rapid after admission with a median of 2 days. Interestingly, a study reported that patients suffering from ARDS and having received corticosteroids had a mortality rate of 46% (23 out of 50) compared to 61.8% (21 out of 34) in patients who did not receive corticosteroids. However, this difference was not significant (P = 0.15). The survival curve showed, however, that the administration of corticosteroids (Methylprednisolone) reduced the risk of death (Hazard ratio: 0.38 (95% confidence interval 0.20-0.72); P = 0.003). The authors concluded that a randomized study was necessary to confirm this impression.\n\nThe theoretical justification for treatment with corticosteroids is related to the recognition of the inflammatory syndrome as a factor in the development of an uncontrolled and harmful fibroproliferative phase. It seems certain that late administration (beyond the 14th day after the start of ARDS) is deleterious in patients by increasing mortality. However, a recent study shows that early administration of dexamethasone (within 30 hours after the start of ARDS) is associated with an increase of ventilator-free days and a decrease in mortality at 2 months.\n\nIn COVID-19 disease, there is also a cytokine storm and an intense inflammatory reaction. Currently the use of corticosteroids is not recommended during a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Administration of corticosteroids may delay elimination of the virus. Recently, a preliminary study reported that the administration of hydroxychloroquine (200mg x3 per day) decreased or even made disappear the viral load. This clinical study appears to corroborate an experimental study. However, hydroxychloroquine can have cardiac toxicity which, although rare, can be serious.\n\nIn summary:\n\nThe appearance of an ARDS during a COVID-19 is burdened with a mortality of 65%\nThe viral load has decreased when ARDS is present\nThe use of hydroxychloroquine makes it possible to significantly reduce the viral load\nEarly administration of corticosteroids seems beneficial in ARDS","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04347980"},

A portion of individuals with COVID-19 experience life-threatening hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation. Management of hypoxia in this population is complicated by contraindication of non-invasive ventilation and limitations in access to mechanical ventilation and critical care staff given the clinical burden of disease. Positional therapy is readily deployable and may ultimately be used to treat COVID-19 related respiratory failure in resources limited settings; and, it has been demonstrated to improve oxygenation and is easy to implement in the clinical setting.\n\nThe overall goal of this randomized controlled trial is to establish the feasibility of performing a randomized trial using a simple, minimally invasive positional therapy approach to improve hypoxia and reduce progression to mechanical ventilation. The objectives are to examine the effectiveness and feasibility of maintaining an inclined position in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 associated hypoxemic respiratory failure. The investigators hypothesize that (1) oxyhemoglobin saturation will improve with therapy, (2) participants will tolerate and adhere to the intervention, and that (3) participants who adhere to positional therapy will have reduced rates of mechanical ventilation at 72 hours. If successful, this feasibility trial will demonstrate that a simple, readily deployed nocturnal postural maneuver is well tolerated and reverses underlying defects in ventilation and oxygenation due to COVID-19. It will also inform the design of a pivotal Phase III trial with estimates of sample sizes for clinically relevant outcomes.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nStudy Design: The investigators will conduct a pilot study to examine the acute effects of inclined posture on oxyhemoglobin saturation and the feasibility of conducting randomized controlled clinical trial among patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19-associated hypoxia.\n\nIn a subgroup of participants, the investigators will examine the acute effect of postural therapy (15-degree incline on hospital beds) on oxyhemoglobin saturation among hypoxic patients to establish a biologic response. The investigators will enroll a subset of participants (n=16) who will lie supine on hospital beds, which will be placed in the horizontal (flat) or 15-degree inclined (reverse Trendelenberg) orientation in random order. During this time, the investigators will continuous record pulse oximetry, pulse rate and variations in peripheral arterial tone with WatchPAT one devices. Subjects will be visually monitored for work of breathing during this time. If work of breathing becomes excessive, as defined as a sustain respiratory rate of >25 and an increase of >5 breaths per minute from baseline, or oxygenation decreases below 88% for > 30 seconds in the inclined position, then maneuvers will be stopped. If the patient meets these criteria in the flat position, then the investigators sit the patient upright, and allow breathing to return to baseline before examining responses in the inclined position.\n\nThe investigators will randomize participants to have beds placed in 15-degree incline or usual care (ad-lib positioning) for 72 hours. During the first night in a subgroup of participants, the investigators will record oxygenation, sleep wake state and markers of sympathetic activity with WatchPAT One devices, which can obtain cardiopulmonary parameters with high temporal resolution. The investigators will obtain vital signs from the data warehouse, which archives telemetry data with a maximum sampling frequency of 1 minute. The investigators will record adherence with continuous accelerometry sensors placed on the bed rails and on the anterolateral surface of participants' chests to measure bed and participants' positions, respectively. Aside from position, participants will receive usual treatment for COVID-19.\n\nThe investigators will enroll in 3 phases. At the end of each phase, the investigators will assess for completion of milestones for proceeding to the subsequent phase, as detailed below:\n\nPilot Study: The investigators will pilot the study in 16 participants to obtain critical information on logistics of conducting the trial including performance of recording instruments in a biocontainment environment, to examine the feasibility of the intervention, perform preliminary safety evaluations to ascertain potential harm and to determine whether the intervention results in a meaningful difference in body position.\nPhase II RCT: If inclined therapy results in a difference in body position and no significant safety issues were detected, the investigators will conduct a phase II randomized-controlled trial (RCT) in 70 participants (see sample size calculation below) to estimate the effect size of inclined position on rates of intubation and determine sample size for a Phase III trial.\n\nRandomization will be occur in both phases and will be stratified by study phase and study site.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04344561"},

Hypovitaminosis D is common in Winter (October to March) at Northern latitudes above 20 degrees North, and from April to September at Southern latitudes beyond 20 degrees below the equator.\n\nIn the past, coronaviruses and influenza viruses have exhibited very high seasonality, with outbreaks occurring preferentially during the Winter. The Covid-19 pandemic is indeed more severe above Winter latitudes of 20 degrees, while it remains until now less severe in the Southern hemisphere, with a much lower number of deaths.\n\nPreclinical research suggests that the SARS-Cov-2 virus enters cells via the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Coronavirus viral replication downregulates ACE2, thereby dysregulating the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and leading to a cytokine storm in the host, causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n\nResearch also shows that vitamin D plays a role in balancing RAS and in reducing lung damage. On the contrary, chronic hypovitaminosis D induces pulmonary fibrosis through activation of RAS. Similarly, hypovitaminosis D has been strongly associated in the literature with ARDS, as well as with a pejorative vital prognosis in resuscitation but also in geriatric units, and with various comorbidities associated to deaths during SARS-Cov-2 infections. Conversely, vitamin D supplementation has been reported to increase immunity and to reduce inflammatory responses and the risk of acute respiratory tract infections.\n\nHigh-dose oral vitamin D3 supplementation has been shown to decrease short-term mortality in resuscitation patients with severe hypovitaminosis D (17% absolute risk reduction). It is considered safe to take oral vitamin D supplementation at doses up to 10,000 IU/day for short periods, particularly in older adults, i.e. a population that is mostly affected by hypovitaminosis D and who should receive at least 1,500 IU of vitamin D daily to ensure satisfactory vitamin D status.\n\nVitamin D supplementation is mentioned as a potentially interesting treatment for SARS-Cov-2 infection but on a scientific basis with a low level of evidence until now.\n\nWe hypothesize that high-dose vitamin D supplementation improves the prognosis of older patients diagnosed with COVID-19 compared to a standard dose of vitamin D.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\n• Inclusion visit A clinical examination is carried out.

These challenges, when faced by those who live with a chronic disease, such as diabetes mellitus (DM), can negatively influence quality of life and adherence to treatment, compromising the control of the disease.\n\nOBJECTIVES The present study aims to investigate the effectiveness of a tele-intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic in improving glycemic control, lipid profile, blood pressure levels and parameters of medication adherence, mental well-being and sleep quality in patients with type 1 DM and type 2 DM.\n\nMETHODS A randomized clinical trial will be carried out with patients with a previous diagnosis of type 1 DM and type 2 DM, who are registered at the Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA). Inclusion criteria will be age greater than or equal to 18 years, collection of HbA1c in the HCPA laboratory in January, February or March 2020 and availability to receive weekly phone calls. Patients will be randomized, stratified by type of diabetes, in two groups: G1: participants will receive a tele-intervention by a case manager weekly to discuss topics related to diabetes management and mental well-being during the social distancing period ; G2: participants will receive the usual care. The primary outcome assessed will be the variation in HbA1c levels comparatively between groups, with or without a tele-guided strategy, after four months of social distancing (or as long as the recommendation of social distancing measures remains). Secondary outcomes will include experiencing confirmation of COVID-19 infection, variation in lipid profile, blood pressure levels and variation in parameters of emotional distress related to diabetes, eating disorders, medication adherence, symptoms minor psychiatric disorders and altered sleep patterns, which will be evaluated with specific and validated scales. According to the sample calculation, 150 patients will be included in the study (92 with type 2 DM and 58 with type 1 DM). Analysis by intention to treat will be performed separately for patients with type 1 DM and with type 2 DM.\n\nSCHEDULE The proposed experiment will start immediately after approval of this project by the research ethics committee. The duration of the proposed intervention is 4 months (or as long as the recommendation of social distancing measures remains. This means that the study may be completed before or after that period, based on national recommendations for social distancing in Brazil), with a data analysis plan and publication of the results until September 2020.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04344210"},

ARDS is characterized by the loss of pulmonary tissue compliance and severe hypoxia. The central pathophysiologic changes of COVID-19+ ARDS are dysregulated inflammation within the alveolar space and altered permeability of the alveolar-capillary barrier. The public health impact of this COVID-19+ ARDS is considerable with a large number of ARDS cases that need to be treated currently on German Intensive Care Units. To date, the associated mortality ranges between 30 to 50%. In the ongoing COVID-19 crisis cases of ARDS will still increase and pose a significant challenge to the German Medical System. Despite the emerging understanding of COVID-19+ ARDS, treatment only remains to be symptomatic using mechanical ventilation, prone positioning and in severe cases of hypoxia extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Current evidence generated by clinical trials demonstrates that patients with ARDS should be referred to a specialized center to receive expert treatment. The use of ECMO might have a beneficial effect on overall patient outcome, yet this has not been proven by clinical trials and to date ECMO is recommended as measure of last resort in the current ARDS treatment guidelines. The timing of ECMO placement to relieve hypoxia is an important question for the treating clinician but is not well studied to date. This might also have impact on the long-term functional outcome of patients. In addition, evidence about the role of ECMO in the outcome of COVID-19+ patients might have significant impact on the referral of patients to a specialized center and is important for the treating physician. Therefore, the investigators want to pursue the questions whether early ECMO placement is superior than the placement of ECMO as a rescue measure, and whether this could result in improved overall outcome of patients with COVID-19+ ARDS.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04341285"},

All the countries of the world take some precautions to prevent the spread of this epidemic disease, which WHO declared it as \"pandemic\". Staying home and social isolation are at the top of these precautions. For this purpose, in Turkey on March 21, 2020, '65 and older individuals began to apply the curfew to individuals with chronic illnesses. However, not leaving the house and social isolation brings with it the limitation of physical activity. Physical activity (PA) is defined by WHO as any bodily movement produced by the contraction of skeletal muscles that increases energy consumption. Recommended PA levels for the elderly (≥65 years) are similar to adults (18 to 64 years old). At the global level, approximately 45% of people over the age of 60 do not meet the recommended level of PA. Studies investigating the relationship between social isolation and health behavior report consistent findings. Individuals with smaller social networks report less healthy diets, excessive alcohol consumption, and less physical activity. The effects of social isolation are related to physical inactivity, smoking and the possibility of having both health risk behaviors together. The decrease in physical performance is associated with the risk of falling, sarcopenia, fragility, decreased quality of life, emotionalization, comorbidity, early death, and increased health care costs. Practical and innovative interventions are needed to reduce the decline in muscle mass, strength and physical performance in the aging population. When today's conditions are evaluated, technology-supported education programs are effective in increasing the motivation for physical activity. The purpose of this study; to evaluate the physical activity level of individuals over the age of 65 who experience social isolation due to the precautions taken in our country to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to investigate the effectiveness of home-based telerehabilitation exercises. It is aimed to use an innovative model based on the digitally supported, home-based exercise program.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04334434","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Scientists and Researchers are working on many aspects of treatment options for the development of vaccination and medication to combat this life-threatening problem. Convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients contains antibodies against COVID-19 which may be beneficial to severely sick COVID019 infected patients. We have planned a randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of this therapy in COVID-19 infected sick patients. We will collect up to 500 ml Convalescent Plasma from the COVID-19 infected recovered patient after 14 days of clinical and radiological recovery with two consecutive COVID-19 negative tests by PCR. We will further test the sample from the collected plasma for COVID-19 specific antibodies and their titer. This plasma will be frozen and sent to the treating center (MAMC). Up to 500ml of convalescent plasma will be transfused to patients who fit the eligibility criteria and are randomized to the convalescent plasma group. This will be done in severely sick patients. Data will be collected for the benefit and adverse events related to convalescent plasma transfusion.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nFor Donors:\n\nMicrotiter plates will be coated overnight at 4°C with 4 μg/mL recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD (receptor binding domain) proteins (50 μL per well). The plates will be washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% vol/vol Tween-20(PBST) and blocked with blocking solution (PBS containing 2% wt/vol nonfat dry milk) for 2 hours at 37 °C. The plates will be then washed with PBST. The serum samples will be diluted to 200-fold into PBS as initial concentration, and serial 3-fold dilutions of serum will be added to the wells and incubated at 37 °C for 60 minutes. After 3 washes, 100 μL of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (for IgG antibody titer detection)and IgM (for IgM antibody titer detection) antibodies solution will be added to each plate, respectively, and incubated at 37 °C for 60 minutes. After 5 washes, 100 μL of tetramethylbenzidine substrate will be added at room temperature in the dark. After 15 minutes, the reaction will be stopped with a2MH2SO4 solution (sulfuric acid). The absorbance will be measured at 450nm. All samples will be run in triplicate. The ELISA titers were determined by endpoint dilution.\n\nSerum Neutralization Assay Vero cells (104) will be seeded 24 hours before the infection in a 96-well plate. On the day of infection, the cells will be washed twice. Serum samples from patients will be incubated at 56 °C for 30 minutes and then diluted 2-fold in cell culture medium (modified eagle medium). Aliquots (40 μL) of diluted serum samples (from2-fold to 2056-fold) will be added to 50 μL of cell culture medium containing 50 times the tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) of the virus strain on a 96-well plate and incubated at 37 °C for 2 hours in CO2 5% vol/vol. Virus antibody mix will be added to cells in 96-well plates and plates will be incubated at 37 °C with a microscopic examination for cytopathic effect after 5-day incubation. The highest dilution of serum that showed inhibition activity of SARS-CoV-2 will be recorded as the neutralizing antibody titer. Assays will be performed in triplicate with negative control samples from healthy volunteers.\n\nFor recipients:\n\nThe serum of each recipient will be obtained and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and neutralizing antibody titers will be tested one day prior to the convalescent plasma transfusion. Changes of Receptor Binding Domain-Specific IgG and IgM ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers before and after convalescent plasma transfusion in patients will be obtained on day 0, day 1, day 3 and day 7.\n\nAll included patients would be randomized to receive either standard medical therapy (supportive therapy) or up to 500 ml of convalescent plasma and standard medical therapy Clinical information of all enrolled patients including symptoms at presentation, time to presentation to the hospital and development of pulmonary symptoms would be recorded.

To date, no randomized controlled trials have tested interventions to reduce mental health consequences of contagious disease outbreaks.\n\nSystemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma) is a rare, chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by vasculopathy and excessive collagen production. Systemic Sclerosis can affect multiple organ systems, including the skin, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and heart. Many people with scleroderma are at risk of serious complications from COVID-19 if infected due to lung involvement (> 40% have interstitial lung disease) and common use of immunosuppressant drugs.\n\nThe objective of The Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network COVID-19 Home-isolation Activities Together (SPIN-CHAT) Trial is to evaluate a videoconference-based intervention designed to improve symptoms of anxiety and other mental health outcomes among individuals with systemic sclerosis at risk of poor mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The trial is a pragmatic randomized controlled trial that will be conducted using an existing cohort of systemic sclerosis patients. We will use a partially nested design to reflect dependence between individuals in training groups but not in the waitlist control. The SPIN-CHAT Program includes activity engagement, education on strategies to support mental health, and mutual participant support.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nBackground: Social distancing and movement restrictions during contagious disease outbreaks are necessary to reduce spread but can lead to negative social and psychological outcomes, including loneliness, depression, and anxiety, particularly in vulnerable populations. An online survey that used snowball sampling techniques and collected data from 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China in January-February 2020 found that over 50% rated the psychological impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak as moderate or severe. Symptoms of anxiety were rated as the most common psychological problem. Self-reported poor physical health status and the presence of a chronic illness were associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety.\n\nSystemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma) is a rare, chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by vasculopathy and excessive collagen production. Onset typically occurs between the ages of 30 and 50 years, and approximately 80% of people with SSc are women. SSc can affect multiple organ systems, including the skin, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and heart. Disease presentation is extremely heterogeneous, and the course of the disease is highly unpredictable. People with SSc commonly experience hand function and mobility limitations, pain, fatigue, sleep problems, pruritus, symptoms of depression, and body image distress from disfiguring aspects (e.g., skin tightening, pigment changes, hand contractures, telangiectasias). Many people with SSc are at risk of serious complications from COVID-19 if infected due to lung involvement (> 40% have interstitial lung disease) and common use of immunosuppressant drugs.\n\nThe Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network (SPIN) COVID-19 Home-isolation Activities Together (SPIN-CHAT) Program is a group videoconference-based intervention designed to improve symptoms of anxiety and other mental health outcomes among individuals with SSc at risk of poor mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary objective of the SPIN-CHAT Trial is to evaluate the effect of the program compared to waitlist control on patient reported symptoms of anxiety as measured by the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Anxiety 4a v1.0 scores.\n\nRecruitment and Enrolment: SPIN is a collaboration of SSc researchers, health care providers, people living with SSc, and patient organizations from Canada, the United States, Europe, Mexico and Australia that has assembled a large multinational patient cohort to collect longitudinal data on patient-reported outcomes in SSc and as a framework for embedding RCTs of e-health interventions. SPIN Cohort participants complete online assessments upon enrolment and at 3-month intervals. To date, over 2000 SSc patients from 47 centres have been enrolled in SPIN's web-based cohort (currently approximately 1800 active participants).\n\nSPIN Cohort participants will be invited by email and by popups to enrol in the SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort, a sub-cohort of the SPIN Cohort. Additionally, recruitment announcements for the SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort will be posted on SPIN's social media and distributed through our patient organization partners. All SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort participants will be invited to complete measures at baseline and every two weeks for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. They will receive email reminders to complete bi-weekly follow-up assessments.\n\nParticipants in the SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort eligible for the SPIN-CHAT Trial will be provided with a brief description of the trial in the SPIN-COVID-19 Qualtrics platform and will be asked if they would be interested in participating in the trial. Those who express interest will be provided with an online version of the trial consent form, which they can also download, and will be given the options of (1) consenting to participate; (2) declining participation; or (3) requesting that a member of SPIN's research team call them to answer questions they have about participating in the trial before consenting.\n\nMethods: The SPIN-CHAT Trial is a pragmatic, two-arm partially nested RCT (PN-RCT) that will be conducted using the SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort. Pragmatic RCTs are conducted to replicate real-world delivery of interventions as much as possible and support decisions on whether interventions should be provided in practice. The trial will be a PN-RCT because participants randomised to the intervention arm will be clustered into intervention groups, and members of each intervention group will interact during videoconference sessions; participants randomly assigned to the waitlist control will not be clustered and will only complete trial measures.\n\nRandom Selection and Allocation: SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort participants who provide consent for participation will be entered into different pools based on their availabilities and taking into consideration time zone differences. Once there are enough participants to complete an intervention group and assign an equal number of participants to waitlist control, SPIN personnel will provide the external service with an anonymised list of participants (only identification numbers will be provided) who could participate in an intervention group based on language and day and time availabilities. For each intervention group and waitlist control pairing, the service will randomly select 16 participants from the pool of enroled participants available based on language, day, and time and will randomly allocate 8 to the intervention group and 8 to the waitlist group using block randomization.This process will be repeated until trial enrolment is complete. One intervention and waitlist control pairing will include 18 participants (9 intervention, 9 waitlist) to accommodate the total number that we anticipate randomizing.\n\nIntervention and Comparator: Mental health outcomes, including anxiety, among people in quarantine are associated with modifiable factors such as degree of isolation, boredom, and ability to manage worry and anxiety. In addition to psychological strategies, including worry reduction and meditative exercises, exercise has been shown to reduce anxiety. Among older adults, where isolation is a common challenge, activity and social engagement are commonly used to address loneliness and feelings of isolation. Recommendations for the World Health Organization and major national public health organizations for managing mental health during COVID-19 emphasize setting and following a routine, managing information sources and quantity, staying connected with others, and finding a way to be physically active.\n\nThe SPIN-CHAT Program is a brief group videoconference intervention that was developed based on best-practice principles for managing anxiety and worry, recommendations for maintaining mental health during COVID-19, and input from the SPIN COVID-19 Patient Advisory Team. Educational segments in each session will be delivered by a research team member with experience and training related to the topic. Leisure activities that will be done at the start of each session will include games (e.g., Pictionary, charades), creative activities (e.g., roll-a-story), cultural activities (e.g., virtual museum tours), social activities (e.g., share your favourite recipe). In the healthy information management and social connection segment, strategies will be provided and discussion will be facilitated on how to stay informed via accurate information sources while avoiding sensationalist and other non-helpful information. Information on using simple (e.g., phone) or more advanced technology (e.g., group videoconferencing) to stay connected will be discussed, along with strategies for connecting regularly with others. The managing worry segments will include an overview of worry, including what it is, the difference between helpful and harmful anxiety or worry, how to identify triggers of worry, and strategies to manage worry, including identifying different types of worrying, using worry journals, worry postponement, and worry time. Exercises will be done with the group to illustrate techniques. In the relaxation segments, an introduction to the purpose of relaxation techniques will be presented, and participants will be guided through brief breathing, mindfulness, and visualization exercises.\n\nThe physical activity segments will include an overview of the physical and psychosocial benefits of physical activity for maintenance of health for chronic disease management, including mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic; movement guidelines to ensure safety; and how to monitor daily physical activity. Participants will be guided through movement options for the home-based setting, including warm-ups, aerobic, and strength activities. Behaviour change techniques to foster building the habit of moving more at home will be taught, including goal-setting, scheduling, addressing barriers, and building social support.\n\nActivity engagement sessions will be guided by the leisure education content model. Sessions will involve interactive group discussion about the benefits of leisure engagement for persons with SSc, addressing physical, social, emotional, intellectual and spiritual realms of health and wellbeing. Sessions will explore barriers to leisure for persons with SSc and includes tips for finding leisure resources within the participants' own homes, both in-person and online.\n\nSample Size: Effects of short anxiety-focused interventions in post-disaster settings are between 0.40 and 0.80 standardized mean difference (SMD). This is larger than estimated minimally important difference for the PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0 score (SMD = 0.23 to 0.34 SMD). For an assumed effect size of SMD = 0.50, a two-tailed test with alpha = 0.05, and an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.05, N=146 provides 80% power or greater for our primary outcome, PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0; assuming 10% dropout, we will recruit 162 participants (81 in 10 SPIN-CHAT groups; 81 waitlist). We believe that this is a conservative power and sample size estimate. First, in cluster RCTs, ICC values for individual patient outcomes are typically lower than our 0.05 estimate. If the true ICC is lower than our 0.05 estimate, this will result in greater power than estimated. Second, there has been no loss to follow-up in the feasibility trial or initial waves of our full-scale trial of the videoconference-based SPIN support group leader program, which has a similar design. Thus, we believe that a 10% loss to follow-up may be conservative.\n\nData Analysis: Analyses will be conducted by a statistician blind to trial arm allocation. For the primary outcome analysis, we will use an intent-to-treat analysis that compares all patients randomly assigned to the SPIN-CHAT Program to all patients assigned to the waitlist control. The intervention effect at 4 weeks will be estimated using a linear mixed model, adjusted for baseline PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0 scores. The model will include a random effect to account for clustering of participants in the training groups, but not for participants in the waitlist control arm, because there is no clustering in the control arm. We will investigate the effects of missing data using multiple imputation. As a secondary analysis, we will additionally adjust for age, sex, baseline loneliness, baseline boredom, and baseline physical activity. Analyses of secondary outcomes will similarly be done (1) controlling for baseline scores only and (2) controlling for baseline scores, age, sex, and other key baseline measures. Statistical significance for all analyses will be determined based on two-sided α = 0.05. In addition, we will use complier-average causal effect analysis to estimate effects among patients who use the intervention compared to similar patients in the waitlist arm of the trial.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04335279"},

Epidemiological figures suggest a high morbidity and mortality of doctors responsible for the care of infected individuals, a factor that darkens further the panorama of the current pandemic. The present proposal has two specific aims: (i) to evaluate whether hydroxychloroquine, used prophylactically at low dose (400mg/week for three months), protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection; and (ii) to examine whether exhaustion and senescence of immune system cells are associated to higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is a PILOT STUDY, a Phase III double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study in which we assess the clinical effect of the prophylactic administration of hydroxychloroquine vs. placebo to healthcare workers working at our University Hospital (HUN). Participants in each arm (n = 43) will be administered with a unique loading dose of 800 mg of hydroxychloroquine the first day followed by 400 mg/week for 90 days. The population to be studied (uninfected healthcare personnel) will be highly exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Taking into account that around 80% do not express symptoms or that these are mild, an active search should be made for individuals who become infected while participating in the study. For this, once the informed consent form is signed, the molecular test for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR will be carried out every 4 days in order to determine as closely as possible the moment the participant become positive. The results of the diagnostic RT-PCR tests will be confronted with: (i) the results of immune monitoring of at least 30 immunological parameters in leukocytes (number and phenotype of: PMN cells, monocytes, T- and B-lymphocytes and NK-cells) and in plasma (levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, GM-CSF, TNF-a, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-IA, IL-1, CRP, Type IFN-alpha and IFN-betta), analyzed by automated flow cytometry software such as tSNE, SPADE, FlowSOM, among others (see attached file); and (ii) the daily recording of data on the presence or absence of signs and symptoms associated with SARS-Cov-2 infection. For the recording of immune monitoring 20mL blood samples will be taken at eight-time points (day 0) and at 8, 15, 21, 30, 45, 60 and 90 days in order to monitor the baseline of immune functionality throughout the 90 days of the study. In summary, this proposal seeks to identify immunological markers of the immune system important for defense against SARS-CoV-2, that may be useful as prognostic markers for clinical response and treatment of patients with COVID-19, and also, to evaluates whether Hydroxychloroquine, used prophylactically, has a role in protecting against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a group of healthcare workers. If hydroxychloroquine, as we all hope, turns out to be an agent that prevent SARS-Cov-2 infection, a significant group of healthcare workers at HUN at risk of becoming ill during the epidemiological peak (expected May 1st), will be protected thanks to their participation in this study.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04346329"},

This is one of the mechanisms blocked by drugs like ruxolitinib and chloroquine.\n\nVarious drugs approved for clinical use that block the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway have been explored. It has been found that the best in vitro and in vivo results were obtained with statins, which also allowed generating a greater potent adaptive immune response.\n\nTherefore, statins and specifically simvastatin make it possible to block the entry process used by COVID-19, block inflammation by various mechanisms and increase the adaptive immune response.

In this context, the decision to hospitalize or to manage COVID-19 patients at home is crucial and defining reliable and consensual criteria is a major issue.\n\nHOME-CoV study is a multicentre quasi-experimental interventional study, before and after implementation of a help-decision making rule (HOME-CoV rule), developed via the Delphi method.\n\nOur main hypothesis is that a strategy based on the consensual HOME-CoV rule compared to current practice is at least as safe as regards the 7-day-rate of adverse events (safety criterion) and more effective as regards the rate of patients eventually managed as outpatients (efficacy criterion).\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nDefinition of HOME-CoV rule:\n\nThe Delphi method is used to reach a consensus of a large panel of experts and to define an easy-to-use clinical rule aiming to help emergency physicians in hospitalisation or outpatient management decision making : the HOME-CoV rule.\n\nThe impact of the rule implementation is evaluated in a before and after study:\n\nbefore period: observational assessment of current practices\nimplementation period : educational lectures, posters, and pocket cards showing and explaining HOME-CoV rule are communicated to participating Emergency Departments.\nafter period : observational assessment of practices\n\nIn each period, patients consulting Emergency Departments with suspected or probable COVID-19 are evaluated for potential inclusion. Clinical, biological and imaging data that may be involved in decision-making about hospitalization are collected as well as the physician final decision (hospitalization or outpatient management) and its main determinants.\n\nA phone-call follow-up is performed and the clinical status according to the Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement of COVID-19 from the World Heath Organization is collected on day 7 and day 28 following inclusion.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04338841"},

A draft paper was released recently in March by Didier Raoult from Aix-Marseille University in France on a preliminary trial of 36 COVID-19 patients. In this trial, 6 patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory symptoms, and 8 had lower respiratory symptoms. Between early and mid-March, they treated 20 of these patients with 600 mg of hydroxychloroquine daily in a hospital setting. Some patient also received the antibiotic azithromycin. 16 patients served as the controls. They observed a significant reduction in viral load in patients with hydroxychloroquine. After 6 days, 70% of the treated patients were considered cured (no virus detected in their samples) compared to 12.5% of controls. All 6 patients who received both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were negative for the virus after 6 days. This was an unblinded, non-randomized trial.\n\nVitamin C has multiple in-vivo effects on immune modulation that may, in sum, limit the development of the cytokine excess associated with critical illness.

Hydroxychloroquine is a known drug with low toxicity that may reduce progression of respiratory symptoms and resulting hospitalizations. This randomized control study will assess its potential as an off-label treatment in reducing the rates of hospitalization and subsequent mechanical ventilation from COVID-19 infection compared to standard of care treatment with Vitamin C. A randomized control trial with placebo is impractical due to the increasing availability of this medication to the public.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04334967","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Nitazoxanide (NTZx) is a derivative of 5-nitrothiazole, synthesized in 1974 by Rosignol - Cavier. NTZx has powerful antiviral effects through the phosphorylation of protein kinase activated by double-stranded RNA, which leads to an increase in phosphorylated factor 2-alpha, an intracellular protein with antiviral effects. The purpose of this study is to contrast the beneficial effect of NTZx vs NTZx plus hydroxychloroquine in patients Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) as well as against other treatments.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nIntroduction The current pandemic caused by the SARS-COV2 coronavirus (COVID-19) is life-threatening and is challenging the world's best health systems. Accelerated spread of this pandemia led physicians to try a variety of treatments without a well established sequence due to ignorance about this new disease. The case fatality rate has been calculated at 2.2% but there are differences depending on the country affected.\n\nPerspective When comparing the evolution of cases between Spain and Mexico, an apparently less pronounced trend is observed in Mexico, but this may be due to underdiagnosis. In calculations by the Mexican Ministry of Health, around 6% of the patients (approximately 10,500) who contract COVID-19 could be found serious and in need of hospitalization in intensive care.\n\nNTZx NTZx and its circulating active metabolite, tizoxanide, inhibit the replication of a wide range of viruses, both RNA and DNA. It has action against 16 strains of Influenza A virus subtypes H1N1, H3N2, H3N2v, H3N8, H5N9, H7N1 and a strain of influenza B. It also works against respiratory syncytial virus, norovirus, dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis virus, rotavirus , hepatitis B and C, even against the human immunodeficiency virus (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).\n\nProblem Mexico is in Phase 2 according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and more local infections due to coronaviruses are expected. To date, various COVID-19 treatment schemes are being tested, but the usefulness of none can be assured.\n\nWhen reviewing the drug schemes that are being carried out in the world, it calls the attention that developing countries are not included, beyond the fact that the tested alternatives are economically inaccessible.\n\nThis clinical survey aims to test the possible utility of NTZx against COVID-19, alone or in combination with hydroxychloroquine.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04341493"},

SARS-CoV-2 causes an acute and potentially lethal respiratory illness, known as COVID-19, that is threatening to overwhelm health care systems due to a dramatic surge in hospitalized and critically ill patients. Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 typically have been symptomatic for 5-7 days prior to admission, indicating that there is a window during which an effective intervention could significantly alter the course of illness, lessen disease spread, and alleviate the stress on hospital resources.\n\nThere is no known treatment for COVID-19, though in vitro and one poorly controlled study have identified a potential antiviral activity for HCQ. The rationale for this clinical trial is to measure the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine for reducing viral load and shedding in adult outpatients with confirmed COVID-19.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nBackground COVID-19 is pandemic with high mortality among hospitalized patients despite a benign course in the large majority of patients infected. Limited data are available from small outpatient studies and have not shown efficacy in preventing hospitalization. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine have antiviral and immune-modulating effects, but there are no data concerning their efficacy in reducing viral load and shedding in outpatients.\n\nEvidence supporting possible efficacy for hydroxychloroquine. In cell models, chloroquine both interferes with terminal glycosylation of the ACE2 receptor (the cell surface receptor by which SARS-CoV2 enters human cells) and increases endosomal pH, which interferes (at least in vitro) with a crucial step in viral replication.1,2 HCQ is 5x more potent than chloroquine in a Vero cell model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In independent experiments, chloroquine has confirmed in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, HCQ has in vitro efficacy against SARS-CoV-1. According to news releases, an as-yet-unpublished set of case series in China (N reportedly 120) suggests the possibility of rapid viral clearance and low rates of progression to critical illness. In addition to in vitro anti-viral effects chloroquine and HCQ appear to have immune-modulatory effects, especially via suppression of release of TNF and IL6, especially in macrophages.\n\nEvidence against efficacy for hydroxychloroquine. Chloroquine and HCQ have been promoted as extremely broad anti-infective agents for decades. The reported effects include suppression of fungi, atypical bacteria, and viruses. Other than the effects on ACE2 glycosylation, the mechanisms invoked as evidence for efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 have also been invoked for a wide range of viruses. However, when chloroquine and HCQ have been studied in humans, neither agent has demonstrated consistent efficacy in clinical trials, including in HIV, influenza, hepatitis, and Dengue. In one trial, chloroquine resulted in increased viral replication in Chikungunya virus [Roques et al, Viruses 2018 May 17;10(5)] while in another hydroxychloroquine was associated with increased HIV viral load [Paton et al, JAMA 2012 Jul 25;308(4):353]. Expert opinion advises against HCQ for MERS, another serious coronavirus. An underpowered (n=30) study of HCQ in COVID-19 recently published in China did not demonstrate any clinical benefit [Chen et al, J Zhejiang University, 2020 March 9]. The long history of clinical failure despite in vitro anti-viral activity suggests a low probability of efficacy.\n\nRationale for Trial There is significant publicity concerning the potential use of HCQ in this pandemic, and many patients are seeking access to this unproven therapy. The ANZICS guidelines emphasize that novel treatments should be administered within clinical trials; the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines (http://bit.ly/SSCCOVID-19) also affirm the lack of evidence to support the clinical use of (hydroxy)chloroquine. WHO guidance (https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331446/WHO-2019-nCoV-clinical-2020.4-eng.pdf) also strongly affirms that \"investigational anti-COVID-19 therapeutics should be done under ethically approved, randomized, controlled trials.\" The evidence thus strongly favors equipoise.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04342169"},

As of now, the number of coronavirus deaths increased to 108,281 worldwide. Total number of cases approached 1,800,000 according to the latest information. While the number of healed patients was highest in China, 77,525 people with COVID-19 recovered.\n\nCOVID-19 is a highly contagious respiratory infectious disease that can cause respiratory, physical and psychological dysfunction in patients. Respiratory rehabilitation reduces the patient's symptoms of dyspnea, relieves anxiety and depression, reduces the patient's need to apply to the hospital, increases functional capacity and improves the patient's quality of life. Respiratory rehabilitation, according to the feedback from China, is very important for patients in the clinical treatment and recovery process after treatment. Rehabilitation of people with mild disease after discharge is mainly based on improving physical fitness and psychological adaptation. It is also aimed to gradually restore the individual's ability to the activity before the disease and return to the community as soon as possible.

Studies have demonstrated that the lack of this quantitative calibration has resulted in up to 1/3 of the data being lost for SUV and qualitative interpretation; in addition to making quantification impossible.\nThe patient presents in a fasting state - to eliminate digestive processes from interfering with blood flow distributions - and the differences in metabolic and regional blood flow differences (RBFDs) are enhanced with vasodilatory agents, shifting blood flow and isotope towards regions of greater blood flow and metabolism; enhancing isotope delivery, uptake and quantification.\n\nWith a now quantitatively calibrated nuclear camera - in this instance a PLANAR camera - or SPECT/CT or PET/CT/MRI if specifically approved - to allow imaging to be done at patient's bedside reducing the use of hospital resources required for transport and decrease potential for patient complications resulting from a transport - image acquisition will occur for 10-minutes following peak enhancement effect of the vasodilatory agent and timed injection of the isotope based upon the enhancing agent.\n\nRegions-of-interest (ROIs) will drawn by the nuclear technologist - either at the bedside or in the nuclear laboratory - to provide FMTVDM measurements using software already present in the nuclear camera systems.

The measurements also provide information about how rapidly the tissue is changing. FMTVDM provides the quantitative measurement of where the patient is at any point in time during their course of treatment and how they compare with other patients.\nOnce the FMTVDM measurements have been obtained, treatment decisions can be made based upon serial changes in FMTVDM. Treatments outcomes are based upon FMTVDM measurements, including the maximum FMTVDM and the variance in those measurements.

These patients will be selected by the use of a panel of biomarkers and laboratory findings and they will be allocated to immunotherapy treatment according to their needs.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nHumanity is experiencing since November 2019 a new pandemic by the novel SARS Coronavirus-19 (SARS-CoV-2). As of March 16 2020 170,191 documented case were reported worldwide of which 6,526 died1. The analysis of the clinical characteristics of these patients showed that among those who were critically ill with acute respiratory failure the risk of death was as high as 60%2. Main clinical feature is the presence of comorbidities and age more than 60 years whereas main laboratory findings are leukopenia and lymphopenia with hepatic dysfunction and increase of D-dimers3,4. It is also reported that these patients suffer from intense pro-inflammation where hyper-cytokinemia predominates5,6.\n\nThe above characteristics lead to consider two main mechanisms of pathogenesis of this critical condition: macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and immune dysregulation. Early and correct understanding of the mechanism and management are of prime importance. This can be achieved only through a therapeutic protocol where the early recognition of the immune state can be done with the use of biomarkers and with the delivery of the precise treatment aiming to the correction of the immune dysregulation.\n\nData of the Hellenic Sepsis Study Group indicate that MAS can be diagnosed with reliability using serum ferritin7. Concentrations greater than 4,420ng/ml possess diagnostic specificity 97.3% and negative predictive value 98%. According to these data, the risk of developing MAS is greater among patients with comorbidities like type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart failure who are prone to hyper-production of interleukin (IL)-1β by tissue macrophages8. A recent retrospective analysis of patients with severe sepsis and MAS showed that the administration of anakinra decreased 28-day mortality by 30%9. Anakinra is the recombinant antagonist of human IL-1β receptor. IL-1β over-production is the hallmark of the pathogenesis of MAS. Results of a phase III study in 906 patients showed that anakinra was a very safe drug: there was neither excess mortality nor increased susceptibility to secondary infections9. Since November 2017 the randomized clinical trial entitled \"A trial of validation and restoration of immune dysfunction in severe infections and sepsis, PROVIDE\" (EudraCT number: 2017-002171-26, approval 78/17 by the National Ethics Committee, approval IS 75/17 by the National Organization for Medicines, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03332225). In this study patients with sepsis and laboratory diagnosis of MAS are randomized to treatment with placebo or anakinra for seven days. Enrolment was completed in December 2019 and no drug related adverse events have been reported.\n\nRecent unpublished data of the Hellenic Sepsis Study Group demonstrate that patients with immune dysregulation have profound lymphopenia associated with elevated IL-6. This is in accordance with evidence of the H1N1 pandemic where patients with pneumonia had substantial lymphopenia and increased Τ regulatory lymphocytes (Treg). This increase of Τreg was prominent among patients with comorbidities like diabetes mellitus, chronic heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease10,11. The IL-6 blocker tocilizumab is a promising candidate for the reversal of this immune dysregulation.\n\nESCAPE is an address to the personalized management of life-threatening organ dysfunction by SARS-CoV-2. More precisely, patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 associated with MAS and immune dysregulation will be administered treatment with anakinra and tocilizumab respectively.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04339712"},

WHO data reported admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) for 6% of patients, with a mortality rate reaching 45%.

In the initial phase, the therapeutic management also includes empiric antimicrobial therapy (90% of patients, in accordance with LRTI guidelines (ATS 2019) and SRLF Guidelines (2020). One challenge for the ICU physicians is the timing for discontinuation of antimicrobial treatment, especially in case of shock or ARDS, considering that a substantial proportion of COVID-19 pneumonia patients may have pulmonary bacterial coinfection/superinfection. In order to avoid unnecessary prolonged antimicrobial therapy, and subsequent selective pressure, two tests could be combined in a personalized antibiotic strategy:\n\nProcalcitonin (PCT): PCT is a useful tool to guide antibiotics discontinuation in community-acquired pneumonia) and viral pneumonia (PMID24612487).\nRespiratory multiplex PCR FA-PPP (Biomérieux®): panel has been enlarged, including 8 viruses and 18 bacteria (quantitative analysis).

A large epidemic would seriously challenge the available hospital capacity, and this would be augmented by infection of healthcare workers (HCW). Strategies to prevent infection and disease severity of HCW are, therefore, desperately needed to safeguard continuous patient care. Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is a vaccine against tuberculosis, with protective non-specific effects against other respiratory tract infections in in vitro and in vivo studies, and reported morbidity and mortality reductions as high as 70%. Furthermore, in our preliminary analysis, areas with existing BCG vaccination programs appear to have lower incidence and mortality from COVID191.

A research coordinator will reach out to interested participants via phone with the help of an IRB-approved verbal script to introduce the study, confirm eligibility and provide further instructions on how to access and sign the IRB-approved ICD via REDCap using their own electronic devices. It is important that the investigators obtain the consent via REDCAp to a) avoid direct person-to-person contact and comply with social distancing imposed recommendations, and b) minimize the waste of reconstituted BCG by allowing the research personnel to schedule vaccinations in a controlled fashion. Patient registration into the trial will happen immediately after consent has been provided and will involve entering of baseline information into an electronic data capture system (RedCap).\n\nOnce the eligibility is confirmed and the ICD signed by the participant and stored in REDCap, the research coordinator will randomize the participant and communicate the treatment assignment to the nurse administering the vaccination. The nurse will subsequently assign an appointment and communicate date and time of vaccination with the participant.

As of now, the number of coronavirus deaths increased to 108,281 worldwide. Total number of cases approached 1,800,000 according to the latest information. While the number of healed patients was highest in China, 77,525 people with COVID-19 recovered.\n\nCOVID-19 is a highly contagious respiratory infectious disease that can cause respiratory, physical and psychological dysfunction in patients. Respiratory rehabilitation reduces the patient's symptoms of dyspnea, relieves anxiety and depression, reduces the patient's need to apply to the hospital, increases functional capacity and improves the patient's quality of life. Respiratory rehabilitation, according to the feedback from China, is very important for patients in the clinical treatment and recovery process after treatment. Rehabilitation of people with mild disease after discharge is mainly based on improving physical fitness and psychological adaptation. It is also aimed to gradually restore the individual's ability to the activity before the disease and return to the community as soon as possible.

In early 2020 novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) begun to spread from Asia to Europe and beyond forcing WHO to declare global pandemic. Infected patients shed the virus for a median of 20 days. Up to 10% of COVID-19 infected patients develop a severe form of disease requiring intensive care admission and some of them die. SARS-Cov2 is encapsulated positive strand RNA virus that uses ACE-2 of type 2 pneumocytes as binding sites. It has been hypothesised (Gattinoni 2020 ICM editorial) that initial hypoxemia caused by loss of primary injury to pulmonary vasculature leads to hyperventilation and patients self-inflicted lung injury predominantly in lung areas of increase stress and strain. In turn, later during the course of the disease, ARDS develops with a typical restrictive pattern of a stiff, wet and recruitable lung. At presents there is no evidence-based causative treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and there is a burning need of randomised-controlled trials to find effective therapeutic strategies intervention.\n\nExplanation of rationale: Chloroquine has been used for malaria treatment and chemoprophylaxis, and hydroxychloroquine is used for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and porphyrias. Both drugs have in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and other coronaviruses, with hydroxychloroquine having relatively higher potency against SARS-CoV-2 known to be susceptible in vitro to exposure to Hydrochloroquine. At the moment clinical trials are ongoing to test clinical efficacy in pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis in SARS-CoV-2. In one highly cited French non-randomised observational study by Gautret et. al., a significant reduction of virus carriage has been observed in patients co-incidentally treated by Azithromycin in addition to Hydrochloroquine as a part of initial empirical therapy of community-acquired pneumonia. Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic, which binds to the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, thus inhibiting translation of mRNA. The positive-sense RNA viruses and indeed all genes defined as positive-sense can be directly accessed by host ribosomes to immediately form proteins and the effects of Azithromycin on this process are not known. No data are available at present on the clinical efficacy of Hydrochloroquine alone or in combination with Azithromycin and it is likely that any treatment affecting virus replication would only be effective if administered early, before overt ARDS develops.\n\nIn the light of this, the investigators designed a trial in which a hypothesis is tested, that early administation of hydrochlorochine alone or in combination with azithromycin can prevent respiratory deterioration in patients admitted to intensive care due to rapidly progressive COVID-19 infection.\n\nMethods Trial design: Prospective, multi-centre, randomised, pragmatic, double blind trial Participants: Eligibility criteria for participants: Adult (>18 years) within 24 hours of admission to intensive care unit with proven or suspected COVID-19 infection. For the purpose of this study, intensive care unit is defined as a facility that allow continuous monitoring of vital functions and oxygen administration . It is expected that most patients will have rtPCR test known within 24 hours of admission to hospital. Nonetheless, if this is not the case (eg. due to overloaded lab facility, lack of supplies) it is possible to randomise a patient based on a strong clinical suspicion of SARS-Cov-2 infection. In case COVID-19 is not confirmed in retrospect, experimental therapy is withdrawn and the study subject is withdrawn from \"per protocol\" analysis of the primary and secondary outcomes, but remains in \"intention-to-treat\" cohort for the analysis of safety. Exclusion criteria: symptoms of febrile disease for ≥1 week, pregnancy, treatment limitations in place or moribund patients, allergy or intolerance of any study treatment, incl. long QT syndromes, myasthenia gravis, allergies or known deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, participation in another outcome-based interventional trial within last 30 days, patients taking Hydrochloroquine for other indication than COVID-19.\n\nSettings and locations: Central study site is FNKV University Hospital Prague, updated list of participating centres is listed in the appendix.\n\nInterventions: Standard of care. All patients will receive best supportive care that will be monitored, but not protocolised. It is recognised that in the standard of care may substantially differ among study centres and that is why randomisation is stratified. The standard of care also may change in time during the course of the study, for example, if a new evidence emerges and changes the state-of-the art treatment recommendations. Any such event will trigger emergency steering committee meeting, and decision will be taken about further action. REB and regulatory authorities will be notified immediately about the decision taken.\n\nStudy medication: All study medication is provided as a kind gift of Zentiva, ltd. Unblinded study pharmacist will prepare into 40 mls of sterile water study medication, according to patient's allocation into the treatment arm:\n\nHydrochloroquine sulphate 200mg\nAzithromycin dihydrate 500mg\nLactose 500mg (Placebo)\n\nSee enclosed Specifications of Product characteristics. The medication will be administered in covered Jeannete syringe into nasogastric tube (for patients unable to swallowed) or drunk from a black mug by patients who are able to. In both cases at least 50 ml of water will be used for flush. Treatment group allocation is as follows:\n\nSTUDY GROUP HC-A Azithromycin Hydrochloroquine HC Lactose Hydrochloroquine C Lactose Lactose\n\nEach study patient will be given:\n\nDay 1: Patients receive two doses 400 mg of Hydrochloroquine or placebo in 12 hours interval and 500 mg of Azithromycin or placebo once in 24 hours (with the first dose of hydrochloroquine or placebo)\nDays 2-5: Patients receive two doses 200 mg of Hydrochloroquine or placebo in 12 hours interval 250 mg of Azithromycin or placebo once in 24 hours (with the first dose of hydrochloroquine or placebo)\n\nAdjusting IP administration to patients' swallowing capability and GI function:\n\nDuring the study, 3 groups of patients will be enrolled. Those conscious and able to swallow will be given study medication in black mug to swallow. Patients unable to swallow with a nasogastric tube in place will be given the IP via the NG tube reconstituted in sterile water and flushed as per local NG medication guideline. Administration of the IP is temporarily omitted in patients who are unable to swallow but without NG access or do not tolerate any enteral intake (such as patients in profound shock). As soon as the condition preventing IP administration is eliminated, resumption of study medication follows the guidance for day 1.\n\nOutcomes:\n\nPrimary outcome: Composite percentage of patients alive and not on end-of-life pathway who are free of mechanical ventilation at day 14.\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nComposite percentage of patients alive and not on end-of-life pathway who are free of mechanical ventilation at day 14 in the subgroup of patients without the need of mechanical ventilation at baseline.\n\nICU-LOS D28 and D 90 mortality\n\nTertiary (exploratory) outcomes:\n\nViral load at D7 (No of viral RNA copies/ml of blood), proportion of patients alive and rtPCR negative from nasal swab at D14, Difference of FiO2 ratio and respiratory system compliance between day 0 and 7.\n\nChanges to trial outcomes after the trial commenced, with reasons: None at presents Sample size calculation: Based on data from Wuhan and Washington, where 67% of patients were dead in 2 weeks and half of the survivors needed protracted mechanical ventilation, the assumed incidence of the primary outcome in the control group (ie. being alive and off the ventilator in 2 weeks) to be 25%. The study gives us 80% chance to detect the increase of the primary outcome to 50% in one or both interventional groups at p<0.017 with 74 patients in each arm. In order to compensate for drop-out and low of follow up the plan is to enrol 240 subjects into the study. An interim analysis is planned after the primary outcome is known for the 120th subject.\n\nRandomisation: Will be performed in blocks of 3 and stratified for study centre and age (above or at/below 70 years). Electronic Case Record Form (eCRF) will perform randomisation using random sequence script in software R and generates medication code. Rationale: Patient's age is single most powerful predictor of outcome and stratifying randomisation and stratification decreases probability of treatment groups being of different age at baseline by chance. In analogy, study centers may vary in the use of non-protocolised treatments, which could bias the results.\n\nImplementation:\n\nPrior to initiation of each centre, the central research coordinator will train the local dedicated study personnel in the use of e-CRF and other study procedures. The medication will be delivered in sealed numbered boxes and stored in ICUs. Adhering to Good Clinical Practice rules and guidelines is of upmost importance despite all the challenges during current pandemic situation. Nonetheless, the eCRF has been designed to balance the safe conduct of the clinical trial and feasibility of timely data entry during staff shortages and overload. In order to do so, all data that is not essential for safety can be input in retrospect.\n\nCollection data on cointerventions. Data on interventions that the investigators know/think influence survival will be monitored and described. This include concomitant antiviral antimicrobial diagnosis. Data will also be collected on how the respiratory specimen for rtPCR diagnostic was collected (smear, endotracheal aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage).\n\nStatistical methods: Proportion of patients alive and off mechanical ventilation (primary outcome) between intervention and control groups will be calculated using chi square test. P-value is adjusted for multiple comparisons to p=0.017. Survival and ICU/length of stay will be compared using Kaplan-Maier's curves and exploratory analyses my multi-level regression in R. The plan is to analyse the primary outcome separately in patients who require mechanical ventilation at baseline from those who don't and in patients above or below 70 years of age as a priori subgroup analyses.\n\nAs mentioned above, primary and secondary outcomes will only be calculated in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection who received at least one dose of IP. Adverse events will be calculated in all randomised patients (intention-to-treat analysis).\n\nEthical Considerations Benefits and risks. This trial investigates two drugs that are being used off label to treat patients with severe COVID-19 with a balance of potential benefits and harms. Potential benefit include good biological rationale and observational data to believe that one or both drugs can prevent progression of a disease which led to death in 67% of patients in similar condition to those in this study. Possible harms include QT prolongation and resulting life-threatening arrhythmias or retinopathy, which may result in blindness. The investigators believe that clinical equipoise regarding risk/benefit to individual patient justifies well the conduct of this RCT.\n\nInformed consent procedure. Patients with decision-making capacity will be asked to provide written prospective informed consent (See Appendix I) to this protocol. It is expected that a significant proportion of screened patients will lack the capacity to provide informed consent due to altered consciousness, respiratory distress or sedation to facilitate mechanical ventilation. In this situation, the deferred consent policy will be applied as per local law: independent physician will confirm in writing that the patient lacks capacity and fulfils criteria. Then, patient himself/herself are approached to provide consent as soon as they regain capacity. They are given options to continue in the study, to withdraw with permission to use the data collected up to the point or to withdraw from the study and request deleting all data collected. Patient next of kin plays no formal role as surrogate decision maker as per Czech legislature. Nonetheless, the family will be informed when practical about their relative's enrolment into the trial and the family will be offered an information leaflet explaining the nature of the study. All serious adverse event that are suspected from being related to study interventions will be reposted to Research Ethics Board and regulatory authorities as per local legislation.\n\nStopping rules. All SUSARs will be reported to both REB and to the steering committee, who may decide to stop the trial for safety concerns. Apart from safety, other reasons for stopping the trial are:\n\nEmergence of new data ( e.g. publication of the results of a big RCT) that may lead continuation of the trial unethical. This may be due to safety concerns of placebo group (in case strong clinical benefit is proven by other trial) or any of the interventional groups (e.g. if harm is reported by other trials). This rule also applies for emergence of a new treatment.\n\nAfter interim analysis: The steering committee will review primary outcomes and the summary of adverse events in all 3 groups (labelled as A, B, C) whilst still blinded to treatment allocation. The treatment can be stopped if the following criteria are fulfilled:\n\nThere is a significant difference in the primary outcome at p<0.017 in between the groups.\nFutility: The futility criterion is not binding for the steering committee. Based on available data the study statistician calculates the probability of being able to prove the null hypothesis with achieving the target number of subjects and the probability of type II error made by stopping the trial prematurely.\nSafety: In case the number of adverse events in one or more treatment groups is find uneven or unacceptably high.\n\nReplication of key aspects of trial methods and conduct. The trial is designed to be fully reproducible in larger international multi-centre trial.\n\nRole of the sponsors This is investigator-initiated trial endorsed by Czech Society of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care. The most significant resource for the study is unpaid voluntary work of all the personnel conducting the study, who decided to do so in times of worldwide pandemic crisis. Part of the resources were gathered from voluntary donors in a crowdfunding campaign conducted by medical student association. Pharmaceutical company Zentiva, ltd. was approached by investigators and kindly agreed to provide study medication at no cost; however, it has had nor will have any role in study design; collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the report; or the decision to submit the report for publication.\n\nDissemination of Results: The investigators will submit the main results of the trial in an open-access peer-reviewed journal within 3 months after 240th subject completed the 90-day follow up visit, which is expected to happen in Q4 of 2021. The investigators will make fully de-identified record-level raw data available in a public database.\n\nTrial status: NOT YET RECRUITING (as of 1st April 2020)\n\nDeclarations:\n\nThe trial design is in accordance with Declaration of Helsinky and the protocol, care report form and informed consent formularies were reviewed and approved by FNKV University Hospital Research Ethics Board (\"Ethical Committee\") on 1st April 2020 (decision number KH 14-00-2020).","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04339816"},

Our hypothesis is that, in comparison to the placebo, pyridostigmine will reduce in at least 10% a composite outcome [death; mechanical ventilation; >2 point-increase in the SOFA score) by day 28. We will also evaluate interleukin (IL)-6 kinetics during the first 14 days of in-hospital stay.\n\nIt is estimated that 25-33% of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 are admitted to intensive care units (ICU) for severe hypoxemia. The reported mortality in those with severe disease ranges between 38% and 49%. So far, there is no pharmacological therapeutic (or else) strategy known to reduce morbidity and mortality in these patients. Mortality in COVID-19 appears to be mediated not necessarily by the direct effect of the infection, but by the disproportionate inflammatory response of the host.\n\nPyridostigmine is an old drug that, by inhibiting acetylcholine-esterase, the enzymatic machinery that degrades acetylcholine (ACh), results in increased ACh bioavailability. ACh, in turn, ligates to nicotinic-alpha7 receptors in macrophages and T cells, resulting in reduced overactivation of these immune cells. In experimental murine sepsis, this family of drugs has resulted in reduced inflammation and mortality. Human evidence is scarce for severe inflammatory conditions. However, recent evidence from our group and others indicates that pyridostigmine has an immunomodulatory effect in people living with HIV, resulting in elevation of CD4+ T cell counts, decreased immune activation, and reduction in inflammatory mediators. Altogether, this suggests that ACh-esterase inhibitors may act as immunomodulators during viral infections, potentially reducing the inflammatory cascade (the so-called \"cytokine storm\") observed in critically ill COVID-19 patients.\n\nAt the proposed dose (60mg/d), the rate of minor adverse events is less than 5% with no reported serious adverse effects. From that perspective, we consider that pyridostigmine can function as an immuno-modulator and reduce morbidity and mortality in COVID-19-stricken patients, with the added value of a safe pharmacological profile. Moreover, as an old drug, re-purposing it for a novel indication may be a simpler, more efficient approach than developing a novel one from the ground up.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nThe study will be divided into two phases, each with different variables to evaluate, as described below:\n\nThe primary objective of the first phase (proof-of-concept) will be to evaluate the effect of pyridostigmine on the serum level of interleukin (IL)-6 as an indicator of severe inflammation, as well as its kinetics throughout the days that the patient is hospitalized.\n\nIn the first phase, we will evaluate the safety and feasibility of the study in a representative sample and we will explore in a preliminary way the magnitude of the effect of the intervention. Safety will be evaluated according to the adverse effects reported in patients with acute intoxication (accidental or in suicide attempt) with pyridostigmine:\n\nAbdominal pain/cramps\nDiarrhea\nVomiting, nausea, or both\nHypersalivation\nUrinary incontinence\nFasciculations or muscle weakness\nBlurred vision\n\nIn the second phase (to be carried out only if the results of the first phase justify it), the primary outcome to be evaluated is mortality, the requirement of invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation, or an increase in the SOFA scale ≥2 points.\n\nThe following secondary outcomes were evaluated: changes in the total SOFA score between study entry and evaluation at 3, 7, and 14 days; the number of days of hospital stay, days of hospitalization in the intensive care unit, and the need (and if applicable, the number of days required) for invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation.\n\nThe variables to measure are sex, age at hospitalization, date of COVID-19 diagnosis, date and SOFA scale measurement, date of hospitalization, date of transfer to the intensive care unit, date of initiation of mechanical ventilation. , date and reason for leaving the intensive care unit.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04343963"},

Owing to the aerosol producing nature of the dental profession, carrying out dental work on asymptomatic patients carrying coronavirus puts the entire dental team at a great risk of not only acquiring the infection but also transmitting it to the others.\n\nIdentifying an antiviral gargle that could substantially reduce the colonies of COVID-19 residing in mouth and oro-pharynx is likely to reduce the viral load. This topical therapy is speculated to substantially reduce the transmission of infection in micro-aerosol generated in the dental practice. Such topical anti-viral therapy could also help to improve the overall symptoms of the patient. Given the apparent mechanical rather than blood-borne slow advance of coronavirus from nasopharnyx to lung, the possibility exists that reducing viral load through debriding could aid effective immune response in the same way that debriding burns reduces time of healing.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nIt will be a parallel group, double blind-randomized controlled trial annexed with a laboratory based study. Clinical trial will be carried out at the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), Karachi, Pakistan. Patients will be inducted from the pool of known patients (laboratory confirmed COVID-19 participants) already admitted at AKUH. Molecular and immunological testing will be done at the Juma laboratory of AKUH.

Group D (n=10) patients will use 2% hypertonic saline gargle and nasal lavage for a similar time period.\n\nData collection: The baseline oral swab will be taken from the posterior pharyngeal wall on day one before initiating the gargles by trained dentist. The end-point oral swab will be taken on day 5, just after using the prescribed gargle. Patient will be provided with a special hood so that they themselves don't generate aerosol in the immediate vicinity while carrying out the gargling and nasal lavage.\n\nData will be analyzed using SPSS for Windows (version 20.0 SPSS) and Graph Pad (Prism) softwares. Mean and standard deviation of the continuous variables (age, COVID-19 viral counts at baseline and endpoint etc.) will be computed. Frequency distribution of the categorical variables will be determined (gender, co-morbids, presence of hypertension, diabetes, periodontal status etc.) Repeated measures ANOVA will be used to compare the reduction in intra-oral viral loads and the change in inflammatory biomarkers in the four study groups.

The pandemic first described in Wuhan, China, has since spread across the whole world and caused dramatic strain on health care in many countries. The virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes.1 Patients infected with the virus mostly report mild to moderate respiratory symptoms like shortness of breath and coughing, and febrile symptoms. Most recover without requiring special treatment. However, older people, and those with underlying medical problems (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer) are more likely to develop serious illness.1 Younger patients have been reported with serious illness as well. In the present situation, it is of paramount importance to preserve health service capacity by identifying those with serious illness without transferring all infected patients to emergency rooms or Hospitals. In addition, it is important to identify seriously ill patients early enough and before they reach a point of deterioration where they can be extremely challenging to handle in both prehospital and hospital environment.\n\nThe number of subjects with positive test of the virus is increasing and so does the number of patients hospitalized.2 In parallel, most patients with positive test result or typical clinical symptoms are at home with information what to do if their clinical symptom status deteriorates.2 The Norwegian Interaction Reform was implemented in 2012.3 Key elements of the reform are guidance of the health care in the future and identify new directions. Prevention and early efforts are important and this will be achieved by creating co-working arenas for different parts of our health system. More health services must be moved closer to where the inhabitants live and simultaneously strengthening the community health system. New tools for monitoring the well-being of the patients must be developed in order to act early enough to avoid severe deterioration of health status and avoid new hospitalization. This goal has become even more important during the Covid 19 pandemic because the healthcare system is not prepared or built to take care of all these patients in hospitals.\n\nIn the local community's wearable and wireless biosensors collecting continuous physiological data (CPD) in real time in order to generate information reflecting the patients' current state is established. This is recognized as welfare technology, and it is a generic term for a heterogeneous group of technologies.4 There are few studies documenting their efficacy, effectiveness and efficiency. One key driver for the development of wearable biosensors is the potential to use CPD to generate real-time, clinically actionable insights from predictive analytics that include early warnings of clinical deterioration and prompts for behavioral changes. The advent of machine learning methods that can detect subtle patterns from large sets of CPD may make this achievable.\n\nUsing CPD to guide clinical decisions may be a major advance for patients with chronic diseases and at present time when our health system is put on an extreme stretch. This may drive the evolution from episodic to continuous patient care.\n\nThe present study is designed to sample biosensor data from patients treated and observed at home due to mild and moderate SARS-Cov-2 disease. Such a system would be useful, both for the treatment of individual patients as well as for assessing the efficacy and safety of care given to these patients.

The renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) plays an important role in the development of ARDS.\n\nACE2 is one of the enzymes involved in the RAS cascade. Virus spike protein binds to ACE2 to form a complex suitable for cellular internalization. The downregulation of ACE2 results in the excessive accumulation of angiotensin II, and it has been demonstrated that the stimulation of the angiotensin II type 1a receptor (AT1R) increases pulmonary vascular permeability, explaining the increased lung pathology when activity of ACE2 is decreased. Currently available AT1R blockers (ARBs) such as valsartan, have the potential to block this pathological process mediated by angiotensin II. There are presently two complementary mechanisms suggested: 1) ARBs block the excessive angiotensin-mediated AT1R activation, and 2) they upregulate ACE2, which reduces angiotensin II concentrations and increases the production of the protective vasodilator angiotensin 1-7. In light of the above, ARBs may prevent the development of ARDS and avert morbidity (admission to intensive care unit (ICU) and mechanical ventilation) and mortality.\n\nObjective: To investigate the effect of the ARB valsartan in comparison to placebo on the occurrence of one of the following items, within 14 days of randomization:1) ICU admission; 2) Mechanical ventilation; 3) Death.\n\nStudy design: A double-blind, placebo-controlled 1:1 randomized clinical trial Study population: Adult hospitalized SARS-CoV-2-infected patients (n=651).

PP involves placing patients in the prone, i.e. face down position for time periods of up to 16 hours per day. PP promotes lung homogeneity, improves gas exchange and respiratory mechanics permitting reduction of ventilation intensity, and reducing ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).\n\nMaintaining self-ventilation is associated with increased aeration of dependent lung regions, less need for sedation, improved cardiac filling and removes the risk of VILI, and so is an important therapeutic goal in hypoxic patients. The use of PP in awake self-ventilating patients with COVID-19 induced acute hypoxic respiratory failure (AHRF) and/or ARDS could improve gas exchange and reduce the need for invasive MV, but has not been studied outside of case series.\n\nHowever, an increase in oxygenation does not necessarily reduce the risk of invasive MV. PP has significant attached risks such as causing pressure sores in patients, PP is uncomfortable for some patients, it increases nursing workload, and if ineffective could hinder the delivery of other (effective) medical care. Hence there is a need to determine if PP of awake patients is effective in reducing the need for invasive MV. This multi-centre, open label, randomized controlled study of COVID-19 induced AHRF/ARDS will determine if PP reduces the need for mechanical ventilation.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04347941"},

Several independent publications indicate that specific host cellular proteases called dimeric calpains are essential for the replication of multiple RNA viruses including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-1. In 2004, Barnard and colleagues described that the inhibition of calpains 1 and 2 by distinct calpain inhibitors, MDL 28170 and SJA 6017, resulted in anti-SARS-CoV activity by reducing infectious virus particle replication and hence production (Barnard, 2004). This observation was reproduced with MDL 28170, which showed a >7-log reduction in SARS-CoV replication in cell culture systems (Schneider, 2012). The anti-viral activity of the compound was confirmed to be due to inhibition of m calpain by utilizing a small interfering RNA (siRNA) approach to selectively silence expression of this dimeric calpain isoform. This confirmed the specific requirement for dimeric m calpain activity during SARS-CoV replication in vitro (Schneider, 2012). MDL 28170 is a nonclinical tool calpain inhibitor compound with known off-target liabilities that has not been evaluated in nonclinical or clinical safety studies.\n\nIt has been shown that the receptor for SARS-CoV-1 and -2 entry into the cell is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) (Kuba, 2010). ACE-2 and the dimeric calpains (data on file) are co-expressed in respiratory epithelial cells, the site of both viral entry and predominant early lung injury in COVID-19.\n\nIn addition to the potential for anti-viral activity by calpain inhibition, nonclinical animal bleomycin lung injury models demonstrated that BLD-2660 normalized tissue IL-6 levels, a proinflammatory cytokine demonstrated to be elevated in COVID-19 patients and is implicated in disease pathogenesis. This pro-inflammatory cytokine has been shown to contribute to lung damage during SARS-CoV infection and the virus itself is capable of directly inducing its expression (Bozym, 2011; Yoon, 2008). Thus BLD-2660 could potentially reduce both viral replication and the nonproductive host-response to infection, both contributors to morbidity and mortality in COVID-19.\n\nBLD2660, has shown greater selectivity for calpain inhibition than MDL 28170, the prototypic calpain inhibitor utilized to effectively inhibit SARS-CoV replication. BLD-2660 lacks cross-reactivity with other cysteine proteases such as cathepsins. The safety and tolerability of BLD-2660 has been demonstrated in the recently completed Phase 1 single ascending dose (SAD)/multiple ascending dose (MAD) B-2660-101 study.\n\nThis study will evaluate BLD-2660 as an add-on therapy to standard of care (SOC) in hospitalized subjects with recent diagnosis of COVID-19.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04334460","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Reports from China and from Italy describe an overwhelming inflammation which is triggered by the virus, causing a cytokine storm with features of Cytokine-Release Syndrome (CRS) and/or Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS). Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as Interleukin-6 (IL-6) are elevated in the plasma of patients and features of MAS in COVID-19 include elevated levels of ferritin, d-dimer and low platelets.\n\nThere is increasing evidence, that cytokine-targeted biological therapies can improve outcomes in CRS or MAS and even in sepsis. In recognition of the dramatic development of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in a pragmatic manner, already approved and safe therapies should be evaluated for the use in severe COVID-19.\n\nTocilizumab (TCZ), an anti-IL-6R biological therapy, has been approved for the treatment of CRS and is used in patients with MAS (and in other rheumatologic conditions like Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) or Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA), with a good safety profile also in the elderly).\n\nCollectively, the data strongly suggest that neutralization of the inflammatory pathway induced by IL-6 may reduce mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 prone to CRS and ARDS.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04335071"},

In a clinical case published in the Chinese journal of hyperbaric medicine, treatment with repeated HBO sessions prevented admission to intensive care unit with mechanical ventilation in a patient aged 69 who presented with signs of respiratory decompensation. HBOT is the most powerful oxygenation modality in the body today. HBOT can dramatically increase the amount of dissolved oxygen in the blood. HBOT not only promotes blood transport but also its tissue delivery. Furthermore, HBOT has specific immunomodulatory properties, both humoral and cellular, making it possible, for example, to reduce the intensity of the inflammatory response and to stimulate antioxidant defenses by repeating sessions. A virucidal capacity of HBOT might also be involved. HBOT is generally regarded as safe with very few adverse events.\n\nFollowing this feedback, it is proposed in the context of crisis management related to SARS-CoV2 to assess the value of HBO treatment of patients with CoV2 pneumonia.

Thus, sample size calculations in the proposed trial are based on the investigators' best estimates for several parameters.\n\nIn accordance to the effect of oseltamivir against symptomatic influenza, we assumed an approximate effectiveness of approximately 60% (HR of 0.4) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6464969/) as realistic. As a prophylactic intervention with HCQ, which may have side effects and for which supply shortage can be expected, was judged justifiable only if its effectiveness is high, we based our sample size consideration on a HR of 0.3. To estimate the probability of an event in both the experimental and the control group, very little data is available. In a Dutch point-prevalence study 0-10% of health-care workers were infected depending on the healthcare institution, depending on the hospital.

Therapeutic management has three components: symptomatic management, including supplementary oxygen therapy and in case of respiratory distress mechanical ventilation; the antiviral approach; and immunomodulation, aiming at reducing inflammation associated with viral infection, which is considered to take part in severe presentations of the disease.\n\nDuring Covid-19 viral pneumonia related to SARS-COv-2, there is a significant release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the acute phase of viral infection, which could participate in viral pneumonia lesions. In children with less mature immune system than adults, SARS-Cov-2 infection is less severe. The current prevailing assumption is that severe forms of Covid-19 may not only be related to high viral replication, but also to an excessive inflammatory response favoring acute lung injury and stimulating infection.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that early control of the excessive inflammatory response may help reducing the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\nThe investigators will evaluate the benefit, safety and tolerability of corticosteroid therapy to reduce the rate of subjects hospitalized for Covid-19 viral pneumonia who experience clinical worsening with a need of high-flow supplemental oxygen supplementation or transfer in intensive care units for respiratory support.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04344288"},

Fluvoxamine is an anti-depressant drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The use of fluvoxamine for the treatment of COVID-19 is considered investigational, which means the US Food and Drug Administration has not approved it for this use.\n\nThis study is fully-remote, which means that there is no face-to-face contact; study materials including study drug will be shipped to participants' houses. Only residents of Missouri and Illinois may participate.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nWe will consent approximately 152 participants, age 18 and older, who have tested tested positive for COVID-19 and are currently experiencing mild symptoms. All interactions for this study will be conducted remotely by videoconferencing, email, or phone.\n\nScreening: All participants will first complete a pre-screen to see if they may be eligible for the study. Once a participant is confirmed eligible and consented, the study team will send the study materials. These materials will consist of study medication and self-monitoring equipment, including a pregnancy test (for females of childbearing age not using contraception), an oxygen saturation monitor, blood pressure monitor, and thermometer. Once the study team has finalized the screening process, the participant will begin taking the study medication.\n\nRCT: Participants will be randomly assigned (1:1) to take either fluvoxamine or a placebo. This phase of the study will last approximately 15 days and is double-blinded. Participants will take 100mg of fluvoxamine or placebo by mouth three times a day for a daily total of 300mg. They will continue this dose for approximately 15 days. Depending on tolerability, the dose may be adjusted. Participants will also complete short 10-15 minute assessments daily to assess symptoms, results of self-monitoring (including oxygen level, blood pressure, and temperature) and any adverse events.\n\nOpen-label Phase: After completing the randomization phase, participants will then participate in an open-label phase (participant will definitely receive fluvoxamine) that will last up to 15 days. Those randomized to placebo will have the opportunity to try fluvoxamine during this time. Those randomized to fluvoxamine will continue this medication while slowly decreasing the drug. The participant may opt out of this phase. The dosage during this time will be 50-100mg two times daily until discontinuing the drug. Participants will also continue completing short 10-15 minute daily assessments to assess physical symptoms, vitals, and any adverse events.\n\nFollow-up Phase: We will follow participants for approximately 30 days after the end of the randomized phase. During this time, they may continue to complete daily study assessments to monitor physical symptoms, vitals, and adverse events.

Moreover, several studies showed a shorter hospital stay and lower mortality in patients treated with convalescent plasma than those who were not treated with convalescent plasma. Evidence shows that convalescent plasma from patients who have recovered from viral infections can be used effectively as a treatment of patients with active disease.\n\nThe use of solutions enriched of antiviral antibodies has several important advantages over the convalescent plasma including the high level of neutralizing antibodies supplied. Plasma-exchange is expensive and requires large volumes of substitution fluid. Albumin is better tolerated and less expensive, but exchanges using albumin solutions increase the risk of bleeding because of progressive coagulation factor depletion. With either albumin or fresh frozen plasma, increasing the risk of cardiovascular instability in the plasma donor and in the recipient, which can be detrimental in a critically ill patient with COVID 19 pneumonia.\n\nThe aforementioned limitations of plasma therapy can be overcome by using selective apheresis methods, such as double-filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP).DFPP is a modality of plasma purification that performs an initial plasma separation from blood, and the subsequent separation of specific molecules, on the basis of their specific molecular weight (cut-off), by using a fractionation filter. The Fractionation Filter 2A20, because of its membrane sieving cut-off, retains larger molecules and returns plasma along with smaller molecules to the circulation, including the major part of the albumin. The selection of the membrane 2A20 is related to the appropriate Sieving Coefficient for IgG that allows to efficiently collect antibodies from patients which are recovered from COVID-19, with negligible fluid losses and limited removal of albumin. The total amount of antibodies obtained during one DFPP session exceeds by three to four times the total amount provided to recipients with one unit of plasma obtained during one plasma-exchange session from one COVID-19 convalescent donor. This should result in more effective viral inhibition and larger benefit for the patient achieved with one unit of enriched immunoglobulin solution obtained with DFPP than with one unit of plasma obtained with plasma exchange.\n\nThese observations provide the background for a pilot study aimed to explore whether the infusion of antibodies obtained with one single DFPP procedure from voluntary convalescent donors could offer an effective and safe therapeutic option for critically ill patients with severe coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04346589"},

There is a more than 50 years track record of safety of HCQ for treatment and prevention of various disease states. Early data on use of HCQ for COVID treatment suggests anti-viral activity and immunomodulatory properties for reducing inflammation associated with COVID-19. Given the lack of data regarding use of HCQ for COVID-19 prevention in healthy participants in midst of pandemic crisis, this study proposes an expedited feasibility study focusing on safety and early efficacy.\n\nPrior to HCQ administration, baseline SARS-CoV-2 and other baseline biomarker testing will be conducted. During the 4-week study period, participants will be monitored for drug related adverse events and assessed for development of COVID. SARS-CoV-2 assay and biomarker testing will be repeated at the end of four-week study.

The software PASS15 was used for calculations.\n\nThe study will also include a parallel retrospective group of temporally concomitant patients from IRCCS, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, who did not receive an experimental treatment and who are enrolled in an already IRB approved observational study\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nAs of March 12, 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been confirmed in 125 048 people worldwide, carrying a mortality of approximately 3·7%, 1 compared with a mortality rate of less than 1% from influenza. There is an urgent need for effective treatment. The 2019 novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)) has spread rapidly since its recent identification in patients with severe pneumonia in Wuhan, China. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 varies from asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic forms to clinical conditions characterized by respiratory failure that necessitates mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit (ICU), to multiorgan and systemic manifestations in terms of sepsis, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes (MODS). Current management of COVID-19 is supportive, and respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the leading cause of mortality.\n\nThe cytokine profile of COVID-19 patients supports that the fatality is driven by a virally-triggered, self-propagating, hyper-inflammatory state (Mehta et al, 2020). Elevated ferritin (mean 1297·6 ng/ml in non-survivors vs 614·0 ng/ml in survivors; p<0·001) and IL-6 (p<0·0001) have been found to be independent predictors of fatality in COVID-19 patients in China (Ruan et al, 2020).\n\nVOD, known as Veno-Occlusive-Disease or Synusoidal Obstruction Syndrome, is the most characterized of a spectrum of post bone marrow transplantation (BMT) syndromes (including ELS, IPS or aGVHD) characterized by reactive endothelial activation and damage, endothelial-driven paracrine signaling and a pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulant state. Severe VOD frequently progresses to Multi Organ Failure and is characterized by high mortality (>80%), characterized mostly by lung and kidney failure.\n\nHigh levels (elevated early in the course of the disease) of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha characterize VOD and the other post-BMT endothelial diseases (Schots et al, 2003, Gugliotta et al 1994, Remberger et al 1997, Symington et al, 1992). In detail, IL-8 may be involved in the respiratory failure following ARDS, a frequent and fatal outcome of sVOD patients. Intriguingly, high ferritin levels are a well recognized risk factor for the development of VOD in both adult and pediatric settings.\n\nFurthermore, the histopathological examination of lung lesions in VOD syndromes show early alveolar epithelial and lung endothelial injury, resulting in accumulation of protein- and fibrin-rich inflammatory edematous fluid in the alveolar space and progression to interstitial fibrosis, at later stages.\n\nThese patterns are reminiscent of what observed in the only three cases of autoptic examination of lung tissue so far obtained from COVID-19 infected individuals: two from putatively early phase and one from a late phase of the disease: such as, early diffuse alveolar damage with proteinaceous exudates, and chronical inflammation with intra alveolar deposition of fibrin and interstitial fibrosis, respectively.\n\nThus, we suggest here that the pattern of circulating cytokines, similar histopathological findings in infected patients and hyper-ferritinemia represent some hallmarks common to both COVID-19 induced pathology and VOD/SOS (and other endothelial damage syndromes), possibly underlying common mechanisms of progression.\n\nDefibrotide, a polydisperse mixture of predominantly single-stranded polydeoxyribonucleotides, is currently the only therapy approved to treat hepatic VOD/SOS with pulmonary/renal dysfunction (ie, multiorgan dysfunction/multiorgan failure [MOD/MOF]) following HSCT in the United States and to treat severe hepatic VOD/SOS post-HSCT in the European Union. In preclinical and human studies, defibrotide has demonstrated profibrinolytic, antithrombotic, anti-inflammatory, and angio-protective actions, thus promoting an anticoagulant phenotype of the endothelium that protects and stabilizes the function of endothelial cells. In a phase 3, historically controlled, multicenter trial in adults and children with VOD/SOS and MOD/MOF (defibrotide: n = 102; controls treated before defibrotide availability: n = 32), defibrotide resulted in significantly greater day +100 survival following HSCT (38.2%) vs controls (25.0%; propensity analysis-estimated between-group difference: 23%; P = .0109). Importantly, a posthoc analysis of a conspicuous number of defibrotide-treated patients (n=651) has recently shown that defibrotide treatment also to critically ill patients, such as those with ventilator dependence at study entry, could highly benefit from defibrotide treatment.\n\nDefibrotide has, overall, demonstrated endothelial-protective properties, with pro-fibrinolytic, anti-thrombotic, anti-ischemic, anti-inflammatory, and antiadhesive activities, but no significant systemic anticoagulant effects. Defibrotide appears to exert several anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects through interaction with the EC membrane, as shown in an endothelial cell line of hepatic origin.\n\nAt least part of defibrotide's lifesaving activity is due to downregulation of circulating cytokines, chiefly IL-6 and TNF-alpha and by reducing PAI-1 levels, NFKB activation and expression of MHCI and MHCII molecules. As compared to other agents, targeting a specific cytokines or a specific factor, defibrotide's pleiotropic mechanism of action may underlie its effectiveness in both early and late progressed states of MOF and in prophylactic settings as well.\n\nPatients with clinical and radiological evidence consistent with idiopathic pneumonia syndrome, all showed underlying disease processes which can be interpreted as associated with endothelial cell activation injury. Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome is a rare complication following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), defined by diffuse lung injury with no identified etiology, with an incidence of 2-12%.; it shows histological evidence of type II endothelial cell activation, with display of ICAM-1 and/or VCAM-1, and endothelial injury, with endothelial upregulation of eNOS. This, together with histological findings of intra-alveolar fibrin and pulmonary hypertension suggests that endothelial cell activation injury may be a causative factor underlying idiopathic pneumonia syndrome Defibrotide may prove to be useful in the treatment of patients with idiopathic pneumonia syndrome, although stratifying which patients will benefit from this treatment requires further study.\n\nA potential beneficial effect from defibrotide in treating pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) has been suggested. Its action is probably due to the drug's ability to selectively increase prostaglandin I2 and E2 levels and to increase tissue plasminogen activator and decrease plasminogen activator inhibitor function.\n\nThe use of defibrotide does not change the pathway of care, therefore the only changes to the budget are drug acquisition costs and cost avoidance as a result of reduced ICU/HDU use. Defibrotide reduces the length of stay avoiding extended use of ICU or HDU beds (NHS England Clinical Commissioning Policy.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04335201"},

It is hypothesized that TXA will reduce the infectivity and virulence of the virus.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nA recent report in Physiological Reviews proposed that the endogenous protease plasmin acts on COVID19 virus by cleaving a newly inserted furin site in the S protein portion of the virus resulting in increased infectivity and virulence. Patients with hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular illness, lung disease and kidney dysfunction commonly have elevated levels of plasmin/plasminogen and it was proposed that this may be the mechanism for poorer outcomes in patients with these co-morbidities. A logical treatment that might blunt this process would be the inhibition of the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. Fortunately, there is an inexpensive, commonly used drug, tranexamic acid (TXA) which suppresses this conversion and could be re-purposed for the treatment of COVID19. TXA is a synthetic analog of the amino acid lysine which reversibly binds four to five lysine receptor sites on plasminogen. This reduces conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, and is normally used to prevent fibrin degradation. TXA is FDA approved for treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding (typical dose 1300 mg p.o. three times per day x 5 days) and off-label use for many other indications. TXA is used perioperatively as a standard-of-care at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) for orthopedic and cardiac bypass surgeries. At UAB, it is commonly employed in hemorrhaging trauma patients and currently is being studied for perioperative use in Cesarean section surgeries. It has also been utilized for spinal surgery, neurosurgery, orthognathic surgeries and even long term for the treatment of cosmetic dermatological disorders with a long track record of safety.\n\nGiven the potential benefit and limited toxicity of TXA it would appear warranted to perform a rapid randomized, double-blind placebo controlled exploratory trial at UAB in the treatment of the early phases of COVID19 to determine whether it reduces infectivity and virulence of the COVID19 virus as hypothesized.

The overall goal of this exploratory study is to assess both safety and efficacy of 5 days of TXA versus placebo in the COVID19 population. All patients would also receive daily Lovenox. The primary endpoint for the study would be a need for transfer to an ICU. Contact would be daily and via remote processes.

We proposed that the adoptive transfer therapy of MSCs might be an ideal choice to be used. We expect to provide new options for the treatment of critically ill COVID-19 pneumonia patients and contribute to improving the quality of life of critically ill patients.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nSince December 2019, novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan has been fierce and spread rapidly. As of 24:00 on March 4, 2020, China has reported a total of 80567 confirmed cases, 5952 existing critically ill cases, and 3016 dead cases. The COVID-19 pneumonia has grown to be a global public health emergency since patients were first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, which spread quickly to 26 countries worldwide and presented a serious threat to public health. It is mainly characterized by fever, dry cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Some patients may develop into rapid and deadly respiratory system injury with overwhelming inflammation in the lung. Currently, no specific drugs or vaccines are available to cure the patients with COVID-19 infection. Hence, there is a large unmet need for a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19 infected patients, especially the critically ill cases.\n\nRecently, some clinical researches about the COVID-19 published in The Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine suggested that massive inflammatory cell infiltration and inflammatory cytokines secretion were found in patients' lungs, alveolar epithelial cells and capillary endothelial cells were damaged, causing acute lung injury. Several reports demonstrated that the first step of the HCoV-19 pathogenesis is that the virus specifically recognizes the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) by its spike Protein. This receptor is abundant in lung and small intestinal tissues, but is also highly expressed in vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells in almost all organs, including the nervous system and skeletal muscle. The main organ injured by the HCoV-19 is the lung. In fact, HCoV-19 can also involve the nervous system, digestive system, urinary system, blood system and other systems. Therefore, when the initial symptom is discomfort of other systems in the early stage, it is often easy to be misdiagnosed and delay treatment. Moreover, the HCoV-19 is a noncellular form consisting of RNA and protein, which cannot be copied independently. It needs to bind to cell surface receptors to enter the cell to complete the replication, and then be released again. Therefore, once the HCoV-19 enters the blood circulation, it can easily spread to all systems throughout the body, which may be the pathological mechanism that the HCoV-19 directly or indirectly causes neurological symptoms.\n\nIt seems that the key to cure the COVID-19 pneumonia is to inhibit the inflammatory response, resulting to reduce the damage of alveolar epithelial cells and endothelial cells and repair the function of the lung. MSCs, owing to their powerful immunomodulatory ability, may have beneficial effects on preventing or attenuating the cytokine storm.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are widely used in basic research and clinical application. They are proved to migrate to damaged tissues, exert antiinflammatory and immunoregulatory functions, promote the regeneration of damaged tissues and inhibit tissue fibrosis. MSCs play a positive role mainly in two ways, namely immunomodulatory effects and differentiation abilities. MSCs can secrete many types of cytokines by paracrine secretion or make direct interactions with immune cells, leading to immunomodulation. Studies have shown that MSCs can significantly reduce acute lung injury in mice caused by H9N2 and H5N1 viruses by reducing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the lungs. Compared with MSCs from other sources, human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) have been widely applied to various diseases due to their convenient collection, no ethical controversy, low immunogenicity, and rapid proliferation rate.\n\nHere we conducted an MSC transplantation pilot study to explore their therapeutic potential for COVID-19 pneumonia patients. To explore the effective treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia for the current prevention and control of novel coronavirus pneumonia to find a key and effective clinical treatment means, to fight against the epidemic.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04339660"},

A recent study has shown that patients, sometimes young, requiring hospitalization in intensive care have deregulation of cytokines with very high levels of IL-6, IL-2, IL-7, IL-10 and TNF-α. The cytokines involved in the pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of CRS are mainly IL-6, gamma interferon (IFN-g), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) and IL-10.\n\nAlthough immunoinflammatory therapy is not systematically recommended in pneumonia linked to SARS-CoV-2, given the CRS and the pathophysiological results of pulmonary edema and the formation of the hyaline membrane, a targeted therapeutic approach and temporally accompanied by adequate ventilatory support could be beneficial in patients with severe pneumonia who develop ARDS. Tocilizumab (Roactemra®) is a drug that blocks the IL-6 receptor commonly prescribed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The intravenous formulation has been approved for the treatment of CRS which occurs during treatment with Car-T; given the clinical picture and cytokine levels in patients with severe SARS-Cov-2 pneumonia, Tocilizumab or another anti-IL6R antagonist may reasonably be expected to contribute to the control of virus-induced Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) in patients with elevated levels of IL-6.\n\nThe objectivation of high interleukin 6 levels in these patients should be an important scientific argument to justify the administration of therapy based on antagonization of IL6. Measurement of other pro inflammatory cytokines will shed light on the mechanism of the inflammatory syndrome induced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nOne of the pathophysiological mechanisms of pulmonary pathology could be the induction of the production of complement factors by interleukin 6 as well as the activation of the complement cascade by the virus via the lectin pathway. It is known that one of the effects of Tocilizumab is to reduce the concentration of the various complement factors, the synthesis of which is under the control of interleukin 6. This is why this study proposes to measure certain parameters of the complement (CH50, C3, C4, C3d, C5a, SC5b-9, C4a, MASP-2) in order to objectify and quantify this activation.\n\nIf the activation of the complement proves significant it could be an argument for a treatment targeting more specifically the cascade of the complement.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04346017"},

Convalescent plasma from patients who have recovered from COVID-19 that contains antibodies to the virus is a potential therapy. On March 25th, 2020, the FDA approved the use of convalescent plasma under the emergency investigational new drug (eIND) category. Randomized trials are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 convalescent plasma for acute COVID-19 infection.\n\nThe objective of the CONCOR-1 trial is to determine the efficacy of transfusion of COVID-19 convalescent plasma to adult patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 infection at decreasing the frequency of in-hospital mortality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19.\n\nIt is hypothesized that treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma early in their clinical course will reduce the risk of death, and that other outcomes will be improved including risk of intubation, and length of ICU and hospital stay.\n\nThis pan-Canadian clinical trial has the potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce the burden on health care resources including reducing the need for ICU beds and ventilators.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nProblem to be addressed: In December 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Committee (Wuhan, China) identified an outbreak of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause. Coronavirus RNA was quickly identified in some of these patients.This novel coronavirus has been designated SARS-CoV-2, and the disease caused by this virus has been designated COVID-19.Outbreak forecasting and mathematical modelling suggest that these numbers will continue to rise [1] in many countries over the coming weeks to months.Global efforts to evaluate novel antivirals and therapeutic strategies to treat COVID-19 have intensified. There is an urgent public health need for rapid development of novel interventions. At present, there is no specific antiviral therapy for coronavirus infections.\n\nPassive immunization: Passive antibody therapy involves the administration of antibodies to a given agent to a susceptible individual for the purpose of preventing or treating an infectious disease due to that agent. In contrast, active vaccination requires the induction of an immune response that takes time to develop and varies depending on the vaccine recipient. Some immunocompromised patients fail to achieve an adequate immune response. Thus, passive antibody administration is the only means of providing immediate immunity to susceptible persons and immunity of any measurable kind for highly immunocompromised patients. The only antibody type that is currently available for immediate use is that found in human convalescent plasma.The American Food and Drug Agency (FDA) has recently announced clinical trials and a facilitated access to COVID-19 convalescent plasma for use is patients with severe or life-threatening infections [2].\n\nKnown potential risks and benefits: There is a theoretical risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE) through which virus targeted by non-neutralizing antibodies gain entry into macrophages. Another theoretical risk is that antibody administration to those exposed to SARS-CoV-2 may avoid disease but modify the immune response such that those individuals mount attenuated immune responses, which would leave them vulnerable to subsequent re-infection. Finally, there are risks associated with any transfusion of plasma including transmission of blood transmitted viruses (e.g. HIV, HBV, HCV, etc.), allergic transfusion reactions, including anaphylaxis, febrile non hemolytic transfusion reaction, transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI), transfusion associated cardiac overload (TACO), and hemolysis should ABO incompatible plasma be administered. Potential benefits of COVID-19 convalescent plasma include improved survival, improvement in symptoms, decreased risk in intubation for mechanical ventilation, decrease risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, shortened hospitalization time and suppression of viral load.\n\nMechanism of action: Transfusion of apheresis frozen plasma (AFP) from COVID-19 convalescent patients allows the transfer of donor neutralizing antibodies directed against SARS-CoV2 antigens to the recipient, thus allowing the generation of passive immunization. Naturally produced human antibody are polyclonal, meaning they are directed against a variety of different viral antigens and epitopes allowing for a general neutralizing effect against the virus rather than focussing on a specific target. Administration of convalescent plasma has been associated with rapid decrease in viral load. It is also possible that passive immunization contributes to improved cell-mediated immunity by favoring the phagocytosis and presentation of viral antigens to host T cells.\n\nParticipant recruitment:Only hospitalized COVID-19 patients are eligible so recruitment efforts will be focused on identified consecutive patients admitted to hospital with acute COVID-19 infection. No other external recruitment efforts are planned. At each participating hospital, a process for identifying patients with COVID-19 will be established.\n\nDonor recruitment: Recovered COVID-19 patients will be identified as potential donors in collaboration with provincial public health services, local health authorities, and individual co-investigators involved in the study. Potential donors may also be recruiting following self-identification on the routine donor questionnaire or through social media. They will be contacted by phone and invited to participate in the program as potential donors. After obtaining verbal consent and reviewing donor selection criteria, eligible participants will be directed to a Héma-Québec collection or Canadian Blood Services apheresis collection site in their area to donate.\n\nCriteria for donors: All donors will need to meet the criteria set forth in the Manual of donor selection criteria in use at Héma-Québec or Canadian Blood ServicesIn addition, donors will require:\n\nPrior diagnosis of COVID-19 documented by a PCR test at time of infection or by positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology following infection\nComplete resolution of symptoms\nA delay of at least 14 days since resolution of COVID-19 symptoms\nMale donors, or female donors with no pregnancy history or with negative anti-HLA antibodies\nAt least 6 days since last plasma donation\nProvided informed consent\n\nRandomization procedures: Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio (convalescent plasma vs standard of care). Patients will be randomized using a secure, concealed, computer-generated, web-accessed randomization sequence. Randomization will be stratified by centre and age (<60 and ≥ 60 years). Within each stratum, variable permuted block sized will be used. This approach will ensure that concealment of the treatment sequence is maintained.\n\nDuration of follow-up: Subjects will be followed daily until hospital discharge or death. Patients discharged from hospital before Day 30 will be contacted by telephone on Day 30 ± 3 days to ascertain any AEs, vital status (dead/alive), hospital readmission and need for mechanical ventilation after discharge. Patients discharged from hospital will be contacted at Day 90+/- 7 days to determine vital status. Patients with a prolonged hospital admission will be censored at Day 90. The local study coordinator will collect all study data and record the data in the electronic CRF or paper CRF as per study procedures for each site.\n\nDuration of study: For an individual subject, the study ends 90 days after randomization. The overall study will end when the last randomized subject has completed 90 day follow-up. We estimate that all patient will be enrolled in a period of 6 months, data on the primary endpoint will be available 30 days after last patient enrollment and data on all secondary endpoints will be available after 90-day from last patient enrollment.\n\nSample size considerations: Assuming a baseline risk of intubation or death of 30% in hospitalized patients with standard of care, a sample size of 1200 (800 in the convalescent plasma arm, and 400 in the standard of care arm) would provide 80% power to detect a relative risk reduction of 25% with convalescent plasma therapy using a 2-tailed test at level α = 0.05 and a 2:1 randomization.\n\nInterim analysis: A single interim analysis is planned when the primary outcome (intubation or mortality at 30 days) is available for 50% of the target sample. An O'Brien-Fleming stopping rule will be used at that time, but treated as a guideline, so there is minimal impact on the threshold for statistical significance for the final significance test of the primary outcome. A DSMB will monitor ongoing results to ensure patient well-being and safety as well as study integrity. The DSMB will be asked to recommend early termination or modification only when there is clear and substantial evidence of a treatment difference.\n\nFinal analysis plan: The primary analysis will be based on the intention-to-treat population which will include data from all individuals who have been randomized. Outcomes will be attributed to the arm to which individuals were randomized irrespective of whether they received the planned intervention (e.g. plasma from a convalescent COVID-19 donor).","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04348656"},

When used properly, these irrigations are a safe and easy intervention available over the counter without a prescription. Additionally, baby shampoo has been found to be a safe additive functioning as a surfactant when a small amount is added to the saline rinses which may help augment clearance of the sinonasal cavity.\n\nWhile many systemic medications and treatments have been proposed for COVID-19, there has not yet been a study looking at targeted local intervention to the nasal cavity and nasopharynx where the viral load is the highest. Studies have shown that the use of simple over the counter nasal saline irrigations can decrease viral shedding in the setting of viral URIs, including the common coronavirus (not SARS-CoV-2). Further, as SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus, mild-detergent application with nasal saline would neutralize the virus further. It is our hypothesis that nasal saline or nasal saline with baby shampoo irrigations may decrease viral shedding/viral load and viral transmission, secondary bacterial load, nasopharyngeal inflammation in patients infected with the novel SARS-CoV-2.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nThe novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 and the associated disease process COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) was first seen in late 2019 in Wuhan, China. Over the following months, it quickly spread across the continent and, in short order, the globe, making an impact that hasn't been seen in generations. Although coronaviruses have been prevalent for millennia, this version is immunologically novel, and thus there is no natural immunity to the virus. This has been a major reason for its rapid spread across the world.\n\nPrevious members of the coronavirus family have typically caused upper respiratory symptoms such as the common cold, though there have also been more virulent versions of this virus seen in the recent past, such as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome). Similarly named, SARS-CoV-2 also causes upper respiratory symptoms but has varied from the previous viral syndromes in a number of ways including how quickly it has been able to transmit within a population. This is a disease that does not segregate and can affect all ages, genders, and ethnicities. Everyone is susceptible to this virus.\n\nNew diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for respiratory viruses are also being rapidly developed and polymerase chain reaction-based (PCR) diagnostics and multiplex assays are increasingly used in clinical laboratories for SARS-CoV-2 clinical detection and subtyping. Rapid antigenic and genetic evolution has been expected for SARS-CoV-2 strains, and a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary dynamics is needed to establish an effective vaccine.\n\nOur present understanding of the nature and extent of the upper respiratory track (URT) microbiome in humans is limited. Furthermore, we have little understanding of how acute viral respiratory infections of SARS-CoV-2 influence the URT microbiome, or how genotypic differences in the virus influence the URT microbiome and vice versa. Innate immune responses to pathogens, along with dysregulation of inflammation, are key factors involved in pathogenesis, and different viral pathogens activate different types of inflammatory responses. Respiratory viral infection i.e., SARS-CoV-2 infection is expected to activate TLR2, TLR3, TLR4 and TLR7 responses and this is likely to modulate commensal microbiota populations. It is not yet known if the severity of SARS-CoV-2 disease in older adults is due to a biased host response, SARS-CoV-2 virulence determinants, or the impact infection has on commensal microbiota.\n\nUp to this point, there is no unanimously approved treatment for the disease nor is there a vaccine or antiviral drugs available for the public. The primary methods for treatment of this deadly virus have been supportive in nature including intubation in severe cases with respiratory failure.\n\nWhile a unanimous treatment has yet to be discovered, there has been a great amount of knowledge garnered over the last few months about the virus and the disease that accompanies it. Several studies have demonstrated high viral titers within the nasopharynx and oral cavity and many have posited that this is the primary source of infection and viral replication. Additionally, a high nasal/nasopharyngeal viral load has been associated with increased symptoms and higher severity of the disease.\n\nInterestingly, there have been a number of studies recently looking at the effect of nasal saline irrigations in the setting of viral URIs, including coronaviruses (not including SARS-CoV-2). One of the major takeaways from these studies was decreased viral shedding in patients treated with saline irrigations compared to the control group. Nasal saline irrigations are available over the counter and widely viewed as both safe and affordable. Could these irrigations have a similar effect on the novel SARS-CoV-2 that they have on other viral respiratory infections?","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04347538"},

Based on initial swabs/symptoms, volunteers who are COVID-19 negative will be enrolled in the Prevention study and randomized to receive standard institutional precautions or standard institutional precautions + NORS. Those who are COVID-19 positive will be enrolled in the open-label Treatment Sub-Study.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nThe novel, human-infecting corona-virus, provisionally named 2019 novel corona virus (2019-nCoV) is a single-strand, positive-sense RNA virus and has a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The virus is transmitted via airborne droplets to the nasal mucosa. Replication occurs locally in the nasal mucosa, in ciliated epithelial cells, over a 3-day incubation period. The mucosal cells are damaged with a resultant inflammatory response similar to the common cold. During this time the virus is shed in nasal secretions causing disease in the lower respiratory tract, potentially causing fatal viral pneumonia.\n\nThe literature supports that NO or its derivatives have inhibitory effects on a variety of viral infections. This inhibitory effect was shown to be marked in Interferon (IFN) mediated inhibition manifested by activated macrophage. It was also shown to be correlated with s-nitrosylation of viral proteins such as reductases and proteases.\n\nBased on the genetic similarities between SARS and corona viruses, similar viricidal effects of NO on COVID-19 can be hypothesized.\n\nSaNOtize has developed an innovative approach to provide nitric oxide gas using a formulation called Nitric Oxide Releasing Solution (NORS). This patented solution releases virucidal doses of NO for a sustained period (at least 30 min) against Influenza A.\n\nNORS delivered as a gargle (AM), nasal spray (PRN) or as a nasopharyngeal flush (PM) has the potential to decontaminate the upper respiratory tract that could preventing transmission and progression of COVID-19 in Healthcare Workers & Individuals at Risk of Infection.\n\nThe randomized Prevention study will investigate the ability of NORS to prevent COVID-19 infection when used prophylactically. The open-label Treatment Sub-Study is expected to be small and will provide pilot data on the possibility of NORS as a treatment for Mild/Moderate COVID-19 infection.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04337918"},

However, dysfunctional worry, that is, pervasive worry that is disproportionate in its intensity or duration, and that significantly interferes with every-day problem-solving or goal-driven behavior, is clearly counterproductive. Research has also indicated that repeated media exposure to a community crisis can lead to increased anxiety and heightened stress responses, that can give a downstream effect on health, and misplaced health-protective and help-seeking behaviors which, in turn, may overburden health care facilities. There is an urgent need to develop a brief, scalable intervention to target such dysfunctional worry in the general population.\n\nThe current randomized controlled trial will evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a brief online-delivered cognitive behavioral intervention designed to target dysfunctional worry related to the Covid-19 pandemic. 670 individuals are randomized to intervention or to waiting-list.

In vitro data show that hydroxychloroquine can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication and anecdotal reports from COVID-19 patients in China and France suggest that chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine is a good candidate for treatment. In the French study a favourable effect was seen when hydroxychloroquine was used together with azithromycin in a small series of COVID-19 patients. However, so far all published evidence is based on non-controlled use of hydroxychloroquine.\n\nWe propose to conduct a placebo-controlled trial in COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate disease in Germany to assess virological efficacy, tolerability and safety of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19. The objective of this trial is to identify an effect of hydroxychloroquine on viral clearance in vivo. This data will inform practice for the design of larger trials on clinical efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nThe study is a randomized placebo controlled multicentric Phase III trial. The duration of the trial for each subject is expected to be 6 months. The duration for each individual subject includes 7 days study treatment and 6 months follow-up time. Recruitment of subjects will start in April 2020.\n\nAdult male and female patients with positive COVID-19 diagnosis and fulfilling the below outlined inclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study. Trial population will consist of both genders.\n\nName of IMP: Hydroxychloroquine sulfate (HCQ); Quensyl. All consenting adult patients having confirmed COVID-19 will be recruited and randomly and blindly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either IMP or placebo. Each patient will be given a first dose of 800 mg IMP or the equivalent number of placebo capsules (4 capsules) at the day of inclusion (Day 1). From the 2nd day on, each patient will get 600 mg or the equivalent number if placebo capsules (3 capsules) once a day until day 7 (6 more does of 600 mg). The patient will be given the daily dose of IMP at once for a total of 7 days.\n\nPatients will be monitored on a daily basis until the endpoint (2 measurements of viral load below 100 copies at least 24 hours apart) is reached. During admission visits will be performed by the attending physician or study-nurse, after discharge visits will be performed by qualified and trained study-personnel. Daily procedures will include a pharyngeal swab for qPCR diagnostics (until primary endpoint is reached) and symptom assessment by questionnaire and clinical examination. Blood draw for assessment of full blood count, routine clinical chemistry and assessment of markers of inflammation, and immune response will be performed on days 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 30 and last follow up. ECG and measurement of cardiac enzymes will be performed on a weekly basis or if clinically indicated to identify new onset arrhythmias.\n\nThe efficacy will be assessed by the daily throat swaps and directly followed measurement of SARS-CoV-2-specific RNA copy number until the result of this test will be below the level of detection during at least 2 consecutive visits (24h apart).\n\nSafety will be assessed daily by the study physician until the endpoint is reached and at all subsequent scheduled visits and contacts as well as at any unscheduled visit.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04342221"},

It is hypothesized that TXA will reduce the infectivity and virulence of the virus.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nA recent report in Physiological Reviews proposed that the endogenous protease plasmin acts on the COVID19 virus by cleaving a newly inserted furin site in the S protein portion of the virus resulting in increased infectivity and virulence. Patients with hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular illness, lung disease and kidney dysfunction commonly have elevated levels of plasmin/plasminogen and it was proposed that this may be the mechanism for poorer outcomes in patients with these co-morbidities. A logical treatment that might blunt this process would be the inhibition of the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. There is an inexpensive, commonly used drug, tranexamic acid, (TXA), which suppresses this conversion and could be re-purposed for the treatment of COVID19.\n\nTXA is a synthetic analog of the amino acid lysine which reversibly binds four to five lysine receptor sites on plasminogen. This reduces conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, and is normally used to prevent fibrin degradation. TXA is FDA approved for treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding (typical dose 1300 mg p.o. three times per day x 5 days) and off-label use for many other indications. TXA is used perioperatively as a standard-of-care at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) for orthopedic and cardiac bypass surgeries. At our institution, it is commonly employed in hemorrhaging trauma patients and currently is being studied for perioperative use in Cesarean section surgeries. It has also been utilized for spinal surgery, neurosurgery, orthognathic surgeries and even long term for the treatment of cosmetic dermatological disorders with a long track record of safety. Given the potential benefit and limited toxicity of TXA it would appear warranted to perform a rapid randomized, double-blind placebo controlled exploratory trial at UAB in the treatment of the early phases of COVID19 to determine whether it reduces infectivity and virulence of the COVID19 virus as hypothesized. Involvement of each patient is only for 7 days before primary endpoints.\n\nAn exploratory, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 2 clinical trial in which study patients have just been diagnosed with COVID19 as an outpatient. The overall goal of this exploratory study is to assess both safety and efficacy of 5 days of TXA versus placebo in the COVID19 population. All patients would also receive daily Lovenox. The primary endpoint for the study would be a need for hospitalization. Contact would consist of daily phone contact. Care for COVID19 would otherwise be standard of care.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04338074"},

However, the use of facial masks outside the healthcare system is not recommended by the Danish Health Authorities. Challenges when using facial masks outside the health care system include wearing the mask consistently, an efficacy of the mask of app. 8 hours necessitating a change of mask throughout the day, and that it is not sufficiently tight enough to safely keep the virus out. Moreover, the eyes (mucous membrane) remain exposed. Compliance could also be another challenge. Health Authorities in other countries have different recommendations for the use of facial masks and the authors of the Lancet study concluded; \"Universal use of face masks could be considered if supplies permit. In parallel, urgent research on the duration of protection of face masks, the measures to prolong life of disposable masks, and the invention on reusable masks should be encouraged.\"\n\nSARS-COV2 is assumed to primarily enter the body via the mouth through respiratory droplets or possibly through inhalation of aerosol containing the virus. From the mouth the virus is assumed to spread to the airways and the gastro-intestinal tract. SARS-COV2 is also known to be transmitted via physical contact, helped along by the fact that the virus can survive on surfaces for at least 72 hours. Touching such a contaminated surface can transfer the virus to the mouth via the hand - and thus lead to infection of the person. A study with 26 medical students showed that they touched their face on average 23 times per hour, and that in 44 % of the incidents they touched their mucous membranes3. A Japanese questionnaire study showed that facial masks reduced the risk for school children for getting influenza by 15 %4. N95 mask and surgical facial masks are presumed to have the same effect for healthcare personnel when providing protecting from infection with influenza.\n\nFacial masks are assumed to protect against viral infection in two ways;\n\nBy reducing the risk of getting the virus via mouth or nose through the air via respiratory droplets or aerosol\nBy reducing the transfer from virus-contaminated hands to the mouth or nose\n\nAbout 10 % of the Danish population is estimated to get COVID-19 during the present pandemic-wave; this corresponds to 600,000 Danes. Later COVID-19 waves are expected to occur. The epidemic in Denmark is expected to be at the highest point in medio April. In April and May it be estimated that >2 % of the population will be infected per month.\n\nHypothesis The use of surgical facial masks outside the hospital will reduce the frequency of COVID-19 infection.\n\nMethod The participants recruited are people working outside of their home, who have not previously been infected with COVID-19 and who do not wear facial masks (e.g. healthcare personnel) when working. They will be randomized for\n\nNormal behavior according to the authority's recommendations or\nNormal behavior according to the authority's recommendations and use of facial masks\n\nParticipants will be instructed in using the facial mask consistently when outside their home (and at home when receiving visits from others. The instruction is given in writing and via an instruction video. The participants will be contacted once weekly to optimize compliance. It will be registered if the participants are diagnosed with COVID-19. Participants, who are not tested positive for COVID-19 in the study period will perform a self-test if having symptoms or when the study ends (instruction video).\n\nPerspective The study can determine whether use of facial masks in the public is beneficial and if there is an effect this could have great impact on the current as well as any future, similar epidemics.\n\nInterested participants can register through a link in the add to our research registration database RedCap. The participant will then receive written information and can then register. They will receive a COVID-19 screening test set and (+/-) facial masks ( 2 per day) for the first month. If the participant experience symptoms, he/she will register their symptoms in RedCap, test with a swab-test and send the swab-test to the study investigator for analyses. If negative, new test-sets are sent out - if positive, the participant will be referred to the hospital. This process continues until the participant is tested positive for COVID-19, the pandemic is considered finished by the Danish authorities or when the study ends on May 7 2020. At study end, all participants perform antibody screening and swab test, and send it to the study investigators.\n\nPower calculation With an infection frequency of 2 % in the study period, an expected reduction of the risk to 1 % should be demonstratable with a power of 80 % and a p-value of 5 %, if including a total of 4,636 patients randomized 1:1. If the infection frequency is higher the power of the study will be higher. With an expected defection of 20 % a total of 6,000 participants will be included.\n\nAuthority approvals from The Danish National Committee On Health Research Ethics and The Data Protection Agency have been granted.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04337541"},

There is no data available on the efficacy of antiviral agents for the treatment of COVID-19. In-vitro data show that hydroxychloroquine can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 [1] replication and anecdotal reports from Chinese COVID-19 patients [2, 3] suggest that chloroquine is a good candidate for treatment. No data have been published and reported evidence is based on non-controlled use of hydroxychloroquine.\n\nThe aim of this placebo-controlled trial is to assess the effect of hydroxychloroquine on duration of symptoms in mild COVID-19 patients and time of virus shedding as an important tool to reduce the risk of further community transmissions. This data will inform practice for the design of larger trials on clinical efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment and post- and preexposure prophylaxis of COVID-19 and as a tool for reduction of community transmission.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nThe study is a double-blinded randomized placebo controlled multicentric trial. The trial is expected to be conducted from April to January 2021. The duration for each individual subject includes 7 days study treatment and 21±2 days of follow-up after the last study treatment administration time. Adult male and female patients with positive COVID-19 diagnosis and fulfilling the outlined eligibility criteria will be enrolled into the study. Trial population will consist of both genders. Gender distribution in the trial is supposed to reflect the distribution in the real patient's population, there will be no prior defined quantitative ratio between females and males.\n\nAll consenting and eligible adult patients with virologically confirmed COVID-19 will be recruited and randomly and double-blindly (patient and investigators) allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either IMP or placebo. Each patient will be given a first dose of 600mg IMP (hydroxychloroquine or placebo) at the day of inclusion at the study site. This amount corresponds to 3 capsules. From the 2nd day on, each patient will take 600mg once a day until day 7 (6 more doses of 600mg) at home and will document it in an online form or, when not possible, in a diary.\n\nIMP will be given to the patients orally.

The patients will receive the full amount of study medication (drug or placebo) from a trained study nurse together with a diary. They will be instructed how and when to fill in the diary concerning drug intake, clinical signs and symptoms and, if applicable, any adverse events and changes in concomitant medication. The first assessment of clinical signs and symptoms and a throat swab including blood sample collection will be done under supervision of a study nurse. The patients will then take the first dose of the allocated treatment and document the intake in the diary. This will also take place under the supervision of a study nurse. Patients will then be discharged to home isolation.\n\nDay 2 to Day 7:\n\nOn each of the following 6 days during home isolation the patients will take the study medication and document the intake and the clinical signs and symptoms in their online or paper diary. In case of any adverse events or changes in concomitant medication, the patients will document this in their diary as well. The patients will be asked to contact the investigator in case their clinical condition is getting worse.

In case of any adverse events or changes in concomitant medication, the patients will document this in their diary as well. The patients will be asked to contact the investigator in case their clinical condition is getting worse. As before, home visits will be performed when indicated.\n\nDay 14±1:\n\nPatients will go to the study site and bring their diary and any unused study medication (if applicable). Physical examination will be performed. The patients will document their clinical signs and symptoms, a throat swab and a blood sample will be taken under the supervision of a study nurse. They will be motivated to continue their diary for the follow-up phase with instruction how to use it.\n\nDay 15 to Day 27:\n\nOn each day, the patients will document the clinical signs and symptoms in their diary. In case of any adverse events or changes in concomitant medication, the patients will document this in their diary as well. The patients will be asked to contact the investigator in case their clinical condition is getting worse.\n\nDay 28±2:\n\nPatients will go to the study site and bring their follow-up diary.

Currently, with nearly 1.3 million confirmed cases, there is still no effective way to contain the disease. The transmission of COVID-19 occurs via direct (prolonged close interaction, within 2 meters for more than 30 minutes) and indirect (fomites) contacts. Locally, the risk of COVID-19 infection in household contacts of confirmed cases is about 4%. These at-risk individuals are identified through contact tracing and infectious may be preventable using post-exposure-prophylaxis (PEP). However, there has yet to be a single effective, safe, and affordable pharmacological agent with such capabilities. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a cheap anti-malarial and immunomodulatory agent which may potentially be used as PEP against COVID-19. HCQ is capable of blocking the invasion and intracellular replication of the virus. Existing studies have reported efficacy of HCQ in treating COVID-19, with reduced time to clinical recovery and few reports of patients suffering from significant side effects. However, existing studies are largely limited by their small sample sizes. Furthermore, there has yet to be a published trial on HCQ's role in PEP. This cluster randomized trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral HCQ PEP, taken over for 5 days, in reducing the number of infected household contacts of confirmed COVID-19 patients under home quarantine. Comparison will be made between HCQ PEP (treatment group) and no treatment (control group). Subjects will be followed up over a course of 28 days, with daily symptom monitoring conducted over phone calls. Positive outcomes from this study will provide a means for us to battle the COVID-19 pandemic.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04342156","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

The pandemic known as COVID-19 is now spreading across the world with currently (April 10, 2020) more than 1 115 530 active cases and 96 791 deaths. In most affected countries the current goal is to 'flatten the curve' of the epidemic since there is no health care system that is able to treat an extremely high volume of patients all at once. There is a need for immediately applicable treatments for the patients at highest risk, which gains time until targeted therapies become available. A key feature in the pathomechanism of the disease is that the virus elicits an immunological over-reaction in the human body termed 'cytokine storm'. In susceptible patients this hyper-inflammation itself is a significant burden and may even inhibit the body to generate antibodies against the virus in adequate quantities. Therefore, identifying the subset of patients with excess cytokine response and supplementing them with convalescent plasma from recovered donors may be a life-saving treatment option.\n\nWhat is our study about? In light of recent promising data on plasma therapy in the treatment of COVID-19 and other viral epidemics, there is a need for better understanding the cytokine response to the virus in order to better characterize the target population for convalescent plasma therapy.\n\nOur hypothesis is that convalescent plasma transfusion from healthy donors who recovered from SARS CoV-2 is able to reduce the cytokine storm in addition to replenish the patient's own antibodies in the acutely infected phase of the disease.\n\nA plasmapheresis donation of 400ml will be performed in subjects who recovered from COVID-19 and who are otherwise eligible for plasma donation.

Development of a vaccine by pharmaceutical companies like Roche and antibody concentrates from convalescent patients' plasma by Takeda will take 10-12 months to complete, and we speculate that it will be overwhelmingly expensive and limited in supply. We are presenting this urgent proposal to use the convalescent plasma to save the lives of severely affected COVID-19 patients. Most of the logistic support is already available in MOH Saudi Arabia, and it will be a cheap and quick technique based on the time-tested principles of passive immunization which is supported by the most recent data from China. We are proposing to test the therapeutic potential of convalescent plasma (from patients who have fully recovered from COVID-19) in treating patients with serious COVID-19 disease or those who are at risk of developing a serious disease based on their comorbidities profile. Convalescent plasma could provide our first-line defense for people with Covid-19, especially those who are older and at a much higher risk for complications. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, with no available vaccine or proven antiviral drug, antibodies from recovering patients could provide a \"stopgap\" measure to help in controlling the pandemic effects on health and economy.\n\nWe plan to recruit at least 40 consenting donors and patients. Non-consenting patients will serve as controls.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nCoronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of RNA viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).1,2 The new strain of coronavirus identified in December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei province of China, was called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019- nCoV) and has been named by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The ICTV have determined that SARS-CoV-2 is the same species as SARS-CoV but a different strain. The World Health Organization (WHO) has named the disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections as \"COVID-19\".\n\nClinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infection typically include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), kidney failure and even death. It is not easy to differentiate between non-SARS-CoV-2 seasonal influenza and other respiratory viruses including the locally reported MERS-CoV and H1N1 influenza viruses. SARS-CoV-2 has a higher transmission rate (TR) with an approximate fatality rate of 3%. Although most of the younger patients recover after milder disease, but COVID-19 is most aggressive in the elderly population with worst pneumonia and death rates may reach 14.8%.4 Final diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on viral detection (and if possible, exclusion of other viruses e.g. by Respiratory Viral Panel). Laboratory detection of the SARS-CoV2 is based on detection of viral RNA by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) with confirmation by nucleic acid sequencing when necessary.1-5 For example, GeneFinder™ COVID-19 Plus RealAmp Kit is the One-Step Reverse Transcription Real-Time PCR Kit designed to detect the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) qualitatively through Reverse Transcription reaction and Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction. We will use this or equivalent method to confirm the diagnosis and will repeat the rRT-PCR to make sure it has become negative in a recovered patient. As of now, no vaccine or antiviral drug coming soon, antibodies from recovering patients could provide a \"stop-gap\" measure to help in controlling the pandemic. The concept of using convalescent plasma is not new. It has been tried in limited numbers of patients during more-recent viral crises, including the 2003 SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic, the 2009 \"swine flu\" epidemic, and the 2012 outbreak of MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome).6 Convalescent plasma treatment reduced mortality in patients with severe pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Virus Infection.7 Patients with a resolved viral infection will develop a polyclonal antibody immune response to different viral antigens of 2019-nCoV. Some of these polyclonal antibodies will likely neutralize the virus and prevent new rounds of infection, and the patients with resolved infection should produce 2019-nCoV antibodies in high titer. Patients with resolved cases of 2019-nCoV can simply donate plasma, and then this plasma can be transfused into infected patients.8 Given that plasma donation is well established, and the transfusion of plasma is also routine medical care, this proposal does not need any new science or medical approvals in order to be put into place. Indeed, the same rationale was used in the treatment of several Ebola patients with convalescent serum during the outbreak in 2014-2015.9 Since the emergence of this SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, it has rapidly spread across China and more than 188 other countries and territories. According to the WHO, as of March 27, 2020, there have been 540,832 confirmed cases worldwide and 24,294 deaths. SARS-CoV-2 has structural similarity to SARS-CoV that caused SARS and MERS-CoV.3 In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, there are 1012 confirmed cases reported till now, with 3 deaths (on March 26, 2020).\n\nThe Saudi government's prompt actions to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 seem to be effective. However, CDC Estimates 40-70% of the US population will be infected with SARS-CoV-2. Even with curtailment measures, judging from past pandemics, approximately 40% of human beings will be exposed to COVID-19 over the next 2-3 years. Most of these infected people will recover and almost all of them will be immune. Vigilance and readiness are needed to teach the masses about preventive measures because older people and those with comorbidities will be the sickest. Contemporaneously, therapeutic measures are highly needed from the medical community to treat COVID-19 patients.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04347681"},

Further, new pathologies such as COVID-19-related cardiac dysfunction must be described and rapidly identified. Our innovative measurements will provide direct non-invasive assessments of the effect of COVID-19 infection on key measures including energy expenditure, substrate utilization, muscle mass, cardiac function, mitochondrial function, and body composition. In addition, we will be able to provide objective data on key recovery intervention requirements including energy/nutritional requirements, effects of nutrition and rehabilitation efforts on muscle mass and energy state, and recovery of cardiac, muscle function.Study Questions: We propose to evaluate longitudinal metabolic and cardiac pathophysiology in patients with COVID-19 to understand, guide and optimize our metabolic clinical care during acute hospitalization. Further, this data will be essential in providing objective data to guide physical recovery interventions including nutrition delivery and physical therapy to ensure functional recovery of COVID-19 patients.We hypothesize: 1) COVID-19 will lead to significant, EE/metabolic changes, systemic mitochondrial dysfunction, significant muscle wasting and loss of function throughout the course of illness and during recovery. We hypothesize metabolic needs will initially decrease in acute illness and subsequently increase as patients transition from the acute phase of COVID illness to recovery phases. This data will guide nutrition and metabolic/clinical care in all phases of COVID-19 care where, for example, over-and under-feeding may pose risk to patient outcome. We hypothesize loss of muscle mass and physical function occurring in COVID-19 will significantly affect nutritional/rehabilitative/recovery of function/QoL needs and requires addressing to personalize care to optimize clinical and functional recovery efforts in older COVID-19 patients.We believe longitudinal detailed indirect calorimetry with the innovative new Q-NRG device, cardiac assessment, body composition, and muscle and ultrasound measures in COVID-19 patients will play a key role in understanding and treating COVID-19 infection by providing objective data on the metabolic, cardiac, volume/fluid status, and nutrition needs of COVID-19 patients to the bedside clinician. This will increase our understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and the ability of clinical teams to optimize care and patient outcomes.

The burden of sepsis is increasing worldwide. It is the cause of 8 million global deaths each year. Currently, treatment options are limited to antimicrobials and supportive care such as intravenous fluids, vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, and renal replacement therapy. In the absence of effective therapies specifically targeting the dysregulated immune response, prolonged use of these life-sustaining therapies can be debilitating. A growing body of evidence suggesting that vitamin C, an inexpensive and readily available intervention, is potentially lifesaving in sepsis. Intravenous vitamin C may be the first therapy to mitigate the dysregulated cascade of events that leads to sepsis. If proven effective, vitamin C could be used worldwide and drastically change outcomes in high- and low-income settings alike. Objectives. To determine whether intravenous vitamin C, compared to placebo, reduces mortality and morbidity in sepsis (induced by bacterial and viral pathogens (as COVID-19)), and compare clinical and biochemical measures of organ dysfunction, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) at 6 months. To ascertain the volume of distribution, clearance, and plasma concentration over a course of 96 hours of intravenous vitamin C 50 mg/kg of weight every 6 hours or matching placebo (pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy). Methods. Patients will be randomly assigned to vitamin C (intravenous, 50 mg/kg every 6h) or placebo (0.9% NaCl or dextrose 5% in water) for 96 hours. Study personnel at the clinical sites will document the composite of death or persistent organ dysfunction at day 28. Daily assessments will occur for organ function, on days 1, 3, 7 for inflammation, infection, and endothelial injury biomarkers, at baseline for vitamin C level, and at 6 months for mortality and HRQoL.

The PK substudy will be conducted with 100 participants in 3 of the 25 participating centers. Relevance. In the context of increasing off-label use of vitamin C for sepsis and ongoing trials of vitamin C bundled with other pharmacological interventions, the LOVIT Trial will constitute a rigorous assessment of the effect of vitamin C monotherapy on patient-important outcomes.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT03680274","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

Participants randomized to the intervention group were subsequently enrolled into the automated mobile messaging protocol and received a confirmation message welcoming them to the study, which was reviewed with them by the research assistant. Subjects were instructed that they were only required to read all messages, no responses were required. A single instance of follow-up will take place on Day 14 of the study. This will occur over the phone with a research team member. Subjects will fill out a second set of the patient reported outcome surveys completed at enrollment. Collection of these followup items marks the end of the subject's participation in the study. No data collection is planned following the two week study period. The study hypothesis is that subjects receiving the behavior intervention delivered via an automated mobile messaging robot would demonstrate better patient reported outcome survey scores than controls at follow-up.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04329897","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Eligible patients should be randomized as soon as possible, possibly immediately after the ED triage. Patients randomized to the control arm will be treated according to current clinical practice, which currently does not involve the use of CPAP. Therefore, these patients should not start treatment with CPAP immediately after randomization. CPAP treatment, however, is allowed at a later stage, if deemed appropriate according to clinical judgment. Patients randomized to the experimental arm should begin treatment with CPAP as soon as possible. CPAP should only be performed with a helmet, using a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) between 8 and 14 cmH2O and an inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) between 40 and 60%. FiO2 and PEEP must be modulated, within the limits indicated above, so as to obtain a saturation > 94%.

The median time from onset of symptoms of COVID-19 to development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been reported as short as 9 days. No effective prophylactic or post-exposure therapy is currently available. According to data from the Danish Health Authority (www.sst.dk/corona), as of March 21st, 2020, there were 1326 patients infected with the disease in Denmark, more than 250 are admitted to a hospital, and >50 of them have required intensive care. Nearly 350.000 cases and 15.000 deaths have been reported globally. These numbers are likely to markedly increase during the coming weeks, challenging the capacity of health systems worldwide.\n\nIn patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, it has been described that disease severity and outcomes are related to the characteristics of the immune response. Interleukin (IL)-6 and other components of the inflammatory cascade contribute to host defense against infections. However, exaggerated synthesis of IL-6 can lead to an acute severe systemic inflammatory response known as 'cytokine storm'. In the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, a study found that a cytokine storm involving a considerable release of proinflammatory cytokines occurred, including IL-6, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). Studies on the Middle East respiratory syndrome caused by another coronavirus (MERS-CoV), indicate that cytokine genes of IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-8 can be markedly upregulated. Similarly, patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia admitted to an intensive care unit had higher plasma levels of cytokines including IL-6, IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), interferon-γ-inducible protein (IP10), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP1A), and TNF-α. These findings indicate that the magnitude and characteristics of the cytokine response is related to the severity and prognosis of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\nIt has been suggested that IL-6 blockade may constitute a novel therapeutic strategy for other types of cytokine storm, such as the systemic inflammatory response syndrome including sepsis, macrophage activation syndrome and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Remarkable beneficial effects of IL-6 blockade therapy using a IL-6 receptor inhibitor has been described in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in a retrospective case series from China.\n\nCurrently, there are two available drugs based on human monoclonal antibodies against IL-6 receptor, tocilizumab (RoActemra, Roche) and sarilumab (Kevzara, Sanofi). IL-6 receptor inhibitors are currently licensed for several autoimmune disorders and are considered well tolerated and safe in general. The most common side effects reported are upper respiratory tract infections, headache, hypertension, and abnormal liver function tests. The most serious side effects are serious infections, complications of diverticulitis, and hypersensitivity reactions.\n\nit is hypothesized that IL-6 might play a key role in the cytokine storm associated with serious adverse outcomes in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, and that blockade of IL-6 would be suitable therapeutic target for these patients. The study will investigate the effect of different types of IL-6 inhibition versus no adjuvant treatment compared to standard of care in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\nPrimary objective: To compare the effect of either one of three IL-6 inhibitor administrations, relative to the standard of care, on time to independence from supplementary oxygen therapy, measured in days from baseline to day 28, in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04322773?term=NCT04322773&draw=2&rank=1","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Because SARS-CoV-2 is known to require the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor for uptake into the human body, there have been questions about whether medications that upregulate ACE-2 receptors might increase the risk of infection and subsequent complications. One such group of medications are anti-hypertensives that block the renin-angiotensin system, including both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB). Both ACEi and ARB are widely used for the treatment of hypertension. Early reports from China and Italy suggest that many of those who die from COVID-19 have a coexisting history of hypertension. Consequently, there have been questions raised as to whether these 2 types of blood pressure medication might increase the risk of death among patients with COVID-19. However, it is well known that the prevalence of hypertension increases linearly with age. Therefore, it is possible that the high prevalence of hypertension and ACEi/ARB use among persons who die from COVID-19 is simply confounded by age (older people are at risk of both a history of hypertension and dying from COVID-19). Whether these commonly prescribed blood pressure medications increase the risk of COVID-19 or not remains unanswered. Statements from professional cardiology societies on both sides of the Atlantic have called for urgent research into this question. Our study aims to randomize patients with primary (essential) hypertension who are already taking ACEi/ARB to either switch to an alternative BP medication or continue with the ACEi/ARB that they have already been prescribed. Adults with compelling indications for ACEi/ARB will not be enrolled.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04330300?term=NCT04330300&draw=2&rank=1","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

This new coronavirus was called SARS-CoV-2 and the disease caused by that virus, COVID-19. Recent numbers show that 222,643 infections have been diagnosed with 9115 deaths, worldwide. Currently, there are no approved therapeutic agents available for coronaviruses. In this scenario, the situation of a global public health emergency and evidence about the potential positive effect of chloroquine (CQ) in most coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1, and recent data on small trials on SARS-CoV-2, the investigators intend to investigate the efficacy and the safety of CQ diphosphate in the treatment of hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome in the scenario of SARS-CoV2. Preliminary in vitro studies and uncontrolled trials with low number of patients of CQ repositioning in the treatment of COVID-19 have been encouraging. The main hypothesis is that CQ diphosphate will reduce mortality in 50% in those with severe acute respiratory syndrome infected by the SARS-COV2. Therefore, the main objective is to assess whether the use of chloroquine diphosphate reduces mortality by 50% in the study population. The primary outcome is mortality in day 28 of follow-up. According to local contingency plan, developed by local government for COVID-19 in the State of Amazonas, the Hospital Pronto-Socorro Delphina Aziz, located in Manaus, is the reference unit for the admission of serious cases of the new virus. The unit currently has 50 ICU beds, with the possibility of expanding to 335 beds, if needed. The hospital also has trained multiprofessional human resources and adequate infrastructure. In total, 440 participants (220 per arm) will receive either high dose chloroquine 600 mg bid regime (4x150 mg tablets, every 12 hours, D1-D10) or low dose chloroquine 450mg bid regime (3x150mg tablets + 1 placebo tablet every 12 hours on D1, 3x150mg tablets + 1 placebo followed by 4 placebo tablets 12h later from D2 to D5, and 4 placebo tablets every 12 hours, D6-D10). Placebo tablets were used to standardize treatment duration and blind research team and patients. All drugs administered orally (or via nasogastric tube in case of orotracheal intubation).

COVID-19, the disease caused by this virus, has a very polymorphous clinical presentation, which ranges from upper respiratory tract infections to acute respiratory distress syndrome. It may appear serious straightaway or may evolve in two stages, with a worsening 7 to 10 days after the first clinical signs, potentially linked to a cytokine storm and accompanied by a high risk of thrombosis. The global mortality rate of COVID-19 is between 3% and 4%, with severe forms being more frequent among older patients. Management is symptomatic as no antiviral treatment has demonstrated any clinical benefit in this condition. Hydroxychloroquine is a derivative of chloroquine commonly used in some autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. It is active in vitro in cellular models of infection by many viruses such as HIV, hepatitis C or SARS-CoV. However, its interest in viral infections in humans has not been demonstrated.\n\nVery recently, a preliminary uncontrolled study evaluated the effect of hydroxychloroquine on viral shedding in subjects with COVID-19. Among 20 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 600 mg per day, the percentage of patients with detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the nasopharynx decreased from 100% at inclusion (start of treatment) to 43% six days later. In comparison, 15 of 16 untreated patients had a positive RT-PCR six days after inclusion. Furthermore, hydroxychloroquine has immunomodulating and anti-inflammatory properties, which could theoretically prevent or limit secondary worsening.\n\nThe research hypothesis is that treatment with hydroxychloroquine improves prognosis and reduces the risk of death or use for invasive ventilation in patients with COVID-19.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04325893?term=NCT04325893&draw=2&rank=1","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes"},

Many healthcare systems and organizations are using different protocols and measures to fight the COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir and other antiviral medications are currently under research investigations. Natural honey has been well known for its high health properties in diabetes, nutrition, dyslipidemia, skin lesions and it got FDA approval for topical wound treatment in 2007 as the most potent antimicrobial agent. Honey has been previously considered as an alternative for acyclovir in the treatment of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and it also demonstrated for its significant antiviral effect against varicella zoster virus (VZV). Many studies have demonstrated the broad spectrum antimicrobial effect of honey as an antibacterial, anti fungal, antiviral and antimycobacterial. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the Public Health England (PHE) guidelines recommended honey as a first line of treatment for acute cough caused by upper respiratory tract infection which is currently a cornerstone symptom in COVID-19 infectious disease. Moreover, natural honey should no longer be used as \"alternative\" and deserves to gain more attention by scientists and researchers. The aim of this trial is to study the efficacy of natural honey in treatment of patients infected with COVID-19 in comparison with current standard care.\nMethods:\nThis will be a randomized , multi center, double armed clinical trial, patients will be randomly assigned to two groups on 1:1 basis. Natural honey group will include patients receiving standard care and added intervention in the form of natural honey in a dose of 1gm/kg/day (previously used safely in small studies) divided into 2 to 3 doses for continuous 14 days. The other arm is the arm receiving the standard care according to the center protocol.\nOur primary outcome is days for recovery using the parameters: turning from positive to negative swaps, days from fever to no fever and lung inflammation recovery in x ray or CT, our secondary outcome is the 30 days mortality rate.

Patients with severe COVID-19 have higher serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-6) and chemokines (IL-8) compared to individuals with mild disease or healthy controls, similar to patients with SARS or MERS . The change of laboratory parameters, including elevated serum cytokine, chemokine levels, and increased NLR in infected patients are correlated with the severity of the disease and adverse outcome, suggesting a possible role for hyper-inflammatory responses in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Importantly, previous studies showed that viroporin E, a component of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), forms Ca2C-permeable ion channels and activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. In addition, another viroporin 3a was found to induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation . The mechanisms are unclear.\n\nColchicine, an old drug used in auto-inflammatory disorders (i.e., Familiar Mediterranean Fever and Bechet disease) and in gout, counteracts the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby reducing the release of IL-1b and an array of other interleukins, including IL-6, that are formed in response to danger signals. Recently, colchicine has been successfully used in two cases of life-threatening post-transplant capillary leak syndrome. These patients had required mechanically ventilation for weeks and hemodialysis, before receiving colchicine, which abruptly restored normal respiratory function and diuresis over 48 hrs [4].\n\n","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04322565","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Many obstetrics and gynecology patients are additionally experiencing increased stress due to the healthcare changes the COVID-19 pandemic has caused including delayed or canceled elective surgeries, visitor restrictions, and telemedicine visits instead of in person clinic visits. Mindfulness meditation is a self-management strategy that can be utilized by anyone to assist with the management of stress. Mindfulness meditation mobile applications, such as the \"Calm\" app, can be used to help manage stress, especially during this uncertain time.

The investigators additionally want to evaluate the feasibility of using the mobile app, including looking at adherence to use of the app and patient satisfaction with use of the app.\n\nDetailed Description\t\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic is at the top of many people's minds and is presumably effecting the stress level of most Americans during this time of uncertainty. The COVID-19 public health crisis requires the full resources and attention of healthcare systems. This has led to several healthcare changes that affect obstetrics and gynecology patients, including delays and cancellations in elective surgery, visitor restrictions, and transitioning from in person outpatient visits to telemedicine visits. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) joined with several other OB/Gyn societies to announce their joint statement on March 16th, 2020 to reduce the number of elective surgeries in OB/Gyn to free up healthcare resources. Hospitals and outpatient clinics are instituting visitor restrictions. Specifically, at Banner University Medical Center - Phoenix (BUMCP), they are not allowing any visitors with the exception of one visitor for an obstetric laboring patient or for pediatric patients. All \\non-essential\\\" OB and Gyn visits are transitioning to telemedicine visits through the telephone or video conferencing platforms, with the exception of obstetric visits that require labs, vitals, or fetal assessments. These healthcare changes to OB/Gyn patients is likely impacting their level of stress. Evidence-based interventions for stress include cognitive behavior therapy, although this can be time consuming, requires the need for specialized providers, and is not feasible for all patients during this COVID-19 pandemic. Pharmacotherapy can be used, including antidepressants and anxiolytics, however they have inherent limitations such as side effects, tolerance, and interactions that limit their use. Consumer based mobile applications (apps) may help individuals with self-management strategies for stress (1). Mindfulness meditation is one type of self-management strategy and is the practice of moment-to-moment awareness in which the person purposefully focuses on the present without judgement (1,2). \\\"Calm\\\" is a mindfulness meditation mobile app that offers a range of mindfulness meditation practice guide modules that vary in length, instruction, and content. The app includes meditation lessons, sleep stories (bed-time stories for grown-ups), sleep music, and nature sounds. Few studies on the use of \\\"Calm\\\" exist and include a randomized controlled trial evaluating its affect to decrease stress among college students and a descriptive study evaluating cancer patient's perceptions of the app (1,3). There is limited literature on the effects of mindfulness meditation in obstetrics and gynecology and include its effects on postoperative pain, infertility, and painful bladder (4-6). During these unprecedented times of the COVID-19 pandemic, mindfulness meditation mobile apps such as Calm may be potentially beneficial to help with stress in OB/Gyn patients, although this requires further investigation. The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of the mindfulness meditation app \\\"Calm\\\" on stress, anxiety, and sleep in outpatient obstetrics and gynecology patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants will be randomized to two groups; Arm 1 receives a 30 day free trial at the start of the study, Arm 2 receives a 30 day free trial at the conclusion of the study. All participants will complete a baseline survey on perceived stress, anxiety, and sleep at the start of the study, again at 2 weeks into the study, and again one month later. The investigator's primary objective is to evaluate perceived stress (validated Perceived Stress Scale) with use of the mindfulness meditation app, \\\"Calm,\\\" among outpatient OB/Gyn patients during COVID-19 pandemic. The investigator's secondary objectives are to evaluate anxiety (validated Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and sleep (validated PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Short Form) with use of the mindfulness meditation app, \\\"Calm,\\\" among outpatient OB/Gyn patients during COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the investigators want to assess feasibility with using the app which includes measurements of adherence and participant satisfaction with use of the app.\"","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04329533","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

While researching for a vaccine has been started, effective therapeutic solutions are urgently needed to face this threaten. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has a relevant role in COVID-19, as the virus will enter host 's cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2); RAS disequilibrium might also play a key role in the modulation of the inflammatory response that characterizes the lung involvement. Angiotensin-(1-7) is a peptide that is downregulated in COVID-19 patient and it may potentially improve respiratory function in this setting.\n\nMethods/Design: The Investigators describe herein the methodology of a randomized, controlled, adaptive Phase II/Phase III trial to test the safety, efficacy and clinical impact of the infusion of angiotensin-(1-7) in COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. A first phase of the study, including a limited number of patients (n=20), will serve to confirm the safety of the study drug, by observing the number of the severe adverse events. In a second phase, the enrollment will continue to investigate the primary endpoint of the study (i.e. number of days where the patient is alive and not on mechanical ventilation up to day 28) to evaluate the efficacy and the clinical impact of this drug. Secondary outcomes will include the hospital length of stay, ICU length of stay, ICU and hospital mortality, time to weaning from mechanical ventilation, reintubation rate, secondary infections, needs for vasopressors, PaO2/FiO2 changes, incidence of deep vein thrombosis, changes in inflammatory markers, angiotensins plasmatic levels and changes in radiological findings. The estimated sample size to demonstrate a reduction in the primary outcome from a median of 14 to 11 days is 56 patients, 60 including a dropout rate of 3% (i.e. 30 per group), but a preplanned recalculation of the study sample size is previewed after the enrollment of 30 patients.\n\nExpected outcomes/Discussion: This controlled trial will assess the efficacy, safety and clinical impact of the Angiotensin-(1-7) infusion in a cohort of COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation. The results of this trial may provide useful information for the management of this disease.\n\nDetailed Description\nRationale for the study The cellular entry of the SARS-CoV-2 can result in a functional reduction of ACE2 activity and this could lead to an increased activity of the Ang II/AT1 axis and decreased levels Ang-(1-7)/MasR expression that could contribute to the severity of the disease. The administration of Ang-(1-7) could reestablish this equilibrium, contributing to decrease pulmonary inflammation e thus decreasing the symptoms of the disease. Eligible patients and the next of kin (whenever possible) should be informed about the rationale and the aims of the study and potential risks of drug infusion. Local ethical regulations should be otherwise followed. Due to the eligibility criteria and the urgency setting, a delayed written consent may be obtained after randomization from the next of kin and/or the patient (i.e. after ICU discharge). Randomization will be performed using sealed envelopes with a ratio of 1:1 including information on treatment assignment and a five-digit number, which will be open by the person responsible for drug constitution. Each vial or syringe will be then labeled with the randomly allocated number it will be assigned to the nursing personnel. The doctors and nurses administering the drugs, as well as the local investigators and research personnel who collected data, were unaware of the treatment assignments. Randomization should occur within 24 hours since orotracheal intubation and drug infusion initiated within 4 hours from randomization. Trial will be conducted in adherence to the current Helsinki Declaration and the standard of good clinical practice. Screening of patients will only start after approval of the ethical committees (EC) in the trial sites. No deviation of the protocol will be implemented without the prior review and approval of the ECs. Study Treatment Ang-(1-7) is a pre-constitute intravenous lyophilized formulation containing 0.5 mg/ ampoule and will be administered to patients via a dedicated central venous line at the initial dose of 0.1 mcg/Kg/h (equivalent to 2.5 mcg/Kg/day). After the first hour of infusion, if no decrease in mean arterial pressure (decrease superior to 30% or need to increase vasopressors ‚â• 50% of an initial dosage to maintain a MAP ‚â• 65mmHg), the infusion rate will be increased to 0.2 mcg/Kg/h (equivalent to 5 mcg/Kg/day). The infusion will be continued for up to 48 hours and then stopped. To this end, the substance solution, prepackaged, will be diluted in 1000ml of NaCl 0.9% and then infused using an infusion pump at corresponding speed. The placebo substance, made up of the vehicle alone, will also be intravenously administrated using the same procedure as that for the substance containing the active principle. Patient's management Management of any underlying comorbidity will be at discretion of the attending physicians; the use of international guidelines for the monitoring and the adequate therapeutic interventions are recommended in all patients. In particular, patients ventilation should be managed according to ATS/ESICM/SCCM 2017 consensus for the ventilation in ARDS patients which suggest low tidal volume ventilation (4-8 mL/Kg predicted body weight) associated with low plateau pressure (<30 cmH2O), high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) associated with recruitment maneuvers and prone positioning for periods longer than 12h in severe ARDS patients. Arterial gas analysis assessment should be performed at maximum intervals of six hours or more often according to the attending physician beliefs. Maintenance fluid should be chosen among balanced crystalloids and the quantity will be decided by the attending physician. Glucose management, nutrition protocols, decision to administer neuromuscular blockade, prone positioning, ECMO, nitric oxide or any other adjunctive therapies will be continued according to center current clinical practice and will be recorded in the CRF file. Weaning procedure Regarding the weaning from mechanical ventilation, in order to standardize and reduce bias we will comply with the following procedures based on ARDS Network protocol (ARDSnet). Each day the patients enrolled will be assessed by the medical staff for the following weaning criteria: 1. FiO2 ‚â§ 0.40 and PEEP ‚â§ 8 cmH2O OR FiO2 < 0.50 and PEEP < 5 cmH2O 2. PEEP and FiO2 ‚â§ values of previous day. 3. No neuromuscular blocking agents 4. Patient has acceptable spontaneous breathing efforts (It will be allowed to decrease the respiratory rate on the ventilator up to 50% for 5 min to detect inspiratory effort) 5. Systolic BP ‚â• 90 mmHg If all the above conditions will be met, medical staff will start a spontaneous breathing test (SBT) for up to 120 minutes using one of the following methods and maintaining a: FiO2 ‚â§ 0.5: 1. T-piece Tube 2. Pressure Support Ventilation ‚â§ 5 cmH2O with PEEP ‚â§ 5 cmH2O 3. CPAP with PEEP ‚â§ 5 cmH2O 4. Tracheal Collar mask To test the tolerance at such measures the medical staff will evaluate the following goals for a minimum of 30 minutes up to 120 minutes: 1. SpO2 ‚â• 90% and / or PaO2 ‚â• 60 mm Hg 2. Mean spontaneous tidal volume ‚â• 4 ml/kg PBW (if measured) 3. Respiratory Rate ‚â§ 35 / min 4. pH ‚â• 7.30 (if measured) 5. No respiratory distress (defined as 2 or more of the following): 1. Heart rate ‚â• 120% of the rate (‚â§ 5 min at > 120% may be tolerated) 2. Marked use of accessory muscles 3. Abdominal paradox 4. Diaphoresis 5. Marked subjective dyspnea If all these goals will be met, the medical staff will consider extubation, otherwise the patient will be treated with the pre-weaning settings. Data Collection Data collection on admission will include: demographic characteristics, comorbidities, including use of antihypertensive medications, source of admission, primary and secondary diagnosis, delay since symptoms begin, APACHE II Score (the worst values within the first 24 hours), SOFA score on admission, Chest X-ray and Thoracic CT scan results if available, EKG trace, PaO2/FiO2 on admission. Daily data collection during ICU stay will include: continuous hemodynamic monitoring, including invasive arterial pressure monitoring and continuous EKG; SaO2 and PaO2/FiO2 every 2 hours; blood samples including Hb, glucose and several other chemical variables will be collected at least once per day at 8 am (or the first value of the day); ventilatory parameters and arterial gas analysis will be also collected every six hours; SOFA score; presence of any other documented infection (site, pathogen, treatment); presence of septic shock; daily diuresis and daily total fluid infusion, urine analysis including main electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium) and osmolarity every morning. The occurrence of serious adverse events (see specific paragraph in the text). Duration of ICU stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, need for tracheostomy. In case of death, reasons for withdrawal of care will be recorded. All the data will be recorded using the specific CRF forms, divided into a core section and a daily section and will be uploaded to a web-centralized protected database. Statistical Analysis First phase (Phase IIb) = 15 vs 15 patients Second phase (Phase III) = expected 30 vs 30 patients in total (recalculation of sample size after 15 vs. 15 patients included) The primary outcome of this study is the number of ventilator free days at day 28. Considering an expected median duration of mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 related respiratory insufficiency patients of 14 days, to provide an absolute reduction of 22,5% with an alpha error of 0.05 and to provide a power to detect the effect of 80% and a dropout rate of 3%, 60 patients will need to be included in the primary analysis, 30 in each group. Pre-planned Stratified group analysis will be performed for the following group of patients: 1. History of hypertension vs. no history of hypertension 2. Treatment with ACEi, ARB or DRI drugs vs no treatment 3. Age (<65 vs. ‚â• 65 years) 4. PaO2/FiO2 values at randomization (<100 vs ‚â• 100) 5. Confirmed vs highly suspected COVID-19 Data Safety Management Members of the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) are individuals free of conflicts of interest for this protocol; DSMC will analyze the safety of the study and their membership within the DSMC will be for the duration of this clinical trial. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be recorded at the participating site on the specific CRF and their occurrence will be monitored by the DSMC at the different interim analysis. Formal meeting will be held for each interim analysis to review the data related to the primary outcome, the safety findings as well as the quality of the trial conduct. To enhance the integrity of the trial, the DSMC will have access to the different results aggregated by treatment group and remain unaware of the treatment assignment (the groups will be encoded as A and B). A report including data on recruitment and baseline characteristics and pooled data on eligibility violations will be prepared by the statistician for each DSMC meeting. Only the independent statistician will have access to the whole database. A closed report will be then prepared to allow confidential discussion of clinical data and the DSMC has to prepare minutes of their meetings, with a list of recommendations for the Steering Committee (to continue, to hold or to terminate the trial). If the recommendation is to stop the trial, a final decision will be made after the analysis of all patients included at the time (including patients randomized after data collection for the DSMC meeting). The Steering Committee will be responsible for deciding whether to continue, hold or stop the trial based on DSMC recommendations. The DSMC will be notified of all changes to the trial protocol or conduct. Organization Data will be recorded using pre-printed CRF by the attending physician or a trained research nurse. All data will be periodically introduced by trained personnel in the central web-based database. The study coordinator will contact each time a patient is included the local PI to ensure data collection and reporting as well as completion of patient follow-up or on premature termination of the study protocol. The individual data provided by a participating ICU are primarily property of the ICU who generated the data. All investigators have the right to access their data every time. The Principal Investigators of the study have the responsibility to perform periodic and spot checks visits to monitor the progress of the clinical study. Completed CRFs will be reviewed for completeness, compliance with investigation plan and appropriate device use and accountability. Case report forms will be uploaded on a website with the help of an independent statistician, which will be overseen data entry and data quality management. Data on safety will be provided to the DMSC with regular time intervals. The steering committee will review study integrity, safety and risk/benefit issues after 25 included patients. The rate of these reviews could increase according to report of relevant safety issues. Independent analyses of serious adverse events will be performed and adjudicated if the frequency or nature of serious adverse events warrants it.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04332666","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Given the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV2, it is thus sound to hypothesize that the intravenous administration of UC-MSC during the initial phase of ARDS could control inflammation, accelerate its recovery with improved oxygenation, reduced mechanical ventilation and ventilation weaning time and therefore reduced length of stay in intensive care.\n\nThe feasibility of the project is supported by the expertise of the Méary Cell and Gene Therapy Center, which is approved for the production of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products and has already successfully prepared the first batches of cells, as well as by the involvement of a cardiac surgery team which will leverage its experience with stem cells for the treatment of heart failure to make it relevant to the Stroma-Cov-2 project.\n\nDetailed Description\nGeneral context: As of March 13, 2020, more than 145,000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed with 5,500 deaths worldwide. As of March 21, 14,469 cases have been confirmed in France, of which 562 have been fatal while 1,525 patients are currently hospitalized in intensive care units. Whereas the pandemic continues to spread, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in 30% of patients (Murthy et al., 2020) with a 30%-60% mortality rate. The main physio-pathological hallmark is an acute pulmonary inflammation. Currently, there is no treatment. The objective of this project is to treat intubated-ventilated patients presenting with a SARS-CoV2-related Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) of less than 96 hours by three intravenous infusions of umbilical cord Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (UC-MSC) one every other day (duration of the treatment: one week). The primary endpoint is the PaO2/FiO2 variation from baseline at day 7. The evolution of several inflammatory markers, T regulatory lymphocytes and donor-specific antibodies will also be monitored. The trial will include 60 patients, of whom 20 will be randomized to cell-treatment administered via intravenous route while the remaining 40 patients will be randomized to receive a placebo solution in addition to the standard of care. Patients will be followed up to 12 months after treatment. State of the art: Mesenchymal stem cells feature several attractive characteristics: ease of procurement, high proliferation potential, capacity to home to inflammatory sites, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and immunomodulatory properties. Their therapeutic benefits have been demonstrated in > 100 animal models, including sheep. Specifically, the therapeutic effects of MSC have been demonstrated in ARDS models induced by H1N1, H5N1, H9N2 influenza virus-associated pneumoniae and were also shown to reduce bacterial-induced acute lung injury in a human model of ex vivo perfused lung (Lee et al., 2013). In the clinics, MSC have demonstrated an excellent tolerance in over 3,000 patients (Thompson et al., 2020), regardless of the dosing and delivery route. Three phase I/II trials have included patients with an ARDS and in one (START II), MSC significantly reduced pulmonary endothelial injury (Matthay et al., 2019). If all MSC share several characteristics regardless of the tissue source, the highest productions of bioactive molecules and the strongest immunomodulatory properties are yielded by those from the Wharton's jelly of the umbilical cord (Romanov et al., 2019) which can be scaled-up to generate banks of cryofrozen and thus readily available products. So far, UC-MSC have been used in a wide variety of diseases (reviewed in Scarfe et al., 2018) and, in most cases, they have been delivered via the intravenous route which is clinically attractive because of its non invasive nature and the subsequent possibility of repeated administrations. Labeling techniques have shown that >80% of intravenously injected MSCs are rapidly trapped in the lungs, followed by a rapid distribution of some of the injected MSCs to other tissues including liver, spleen, and inflammatory or injured sites (Brooks et al., 2018). Over all, these biodistribution patterns have been confirmed by human studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) and/or single‚Äêphoton emission computed tomography (SPECT).2 A four-parameter model (injection rate, clearance rate, rate of extravasation and rate of intravasation) predicts that transplanted MSCs are only therapeutically active for a short period of time (probably less than 24 h) (Parekkadan and Milwid, 2010), a timescale consistent with that of the biological responses that they trigger. These assumptions are an incentive to repeated MSC administrations within a short period of time to induce a sustained therapeutic effect and has rationalized our protocol of injecting MSC one every other day over a one week-period, a design consistent with the earlier report of the benefits of delivering MSC at relatively small doses but in a repeated fashion in patients with graft-versus-host disease (Zhou et al., 2010). Once they have homed in the lungs, MSC have been reported to first induce an inflammatory response which is detectable at the tissue level and systemically (Hoogduijn et al., 2013) and is likely due to their interaction with resident lung cells once they have accumulated in the microvasculature. This initial response is then followed by a downstream phase of reduced immune reactivity (Hoogduijn et al., 2013), the mechanisms of which have been extensively investigated. Thus, 24 hours after their intravenous infusion, most of the UC-MSC that have accumulated in the lungs are dead after their phagocytosis by monocytes and neutrophils which then migrate through the blood stream, particularly in the liver (Leibacher et al., 2017; de Witte et al., 2018). Co-culture experiments have shown that the internalization of MSC fragments by monocytes triggers a phenotypic shift which translates into the upregulation of PD-L1 and CD90 along with an increased expression of mRNA levels for IL-1Œ≤, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 and a decreased expression of TNF-Œ±. Of note, monocytes polarized towards an immune-regulatory phenotype increase the expression of Foxp3+ T regulatory lymphocytes while decreasing that of activated CD4+ cells (de Witte et al., 2018). That apoptosis of intravenously infused MSC is a requirement for their immunosuppressive function is further supported by the observation that the cytotoxic activity against MSC is predictive of clinical responses in patients treated by MSC for graft-versus-host disease, i.e., the best responders are those with high cytotoxicity; in this study, the postulated mechanistic link is that phagocytes that have engulfed apoptotic MSC then produce indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and thus ultimately deliver MSC immunosuppressive activity (Galleu et al., 2017). Given the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV2, it is thus sound to hypothesize that the intravenous administration of UC-MSC during the initial phase of ARDS could control inflammation, accelerate its recovery with improved oxygenation, reduced mechanical ventilation and ventilation weaning time and therefore reduced length of stay in intensive care. This assumption is indeed supported by the recent results of a preliminary Chinese trial in which MSC (the source of which has not be specified) have been reported to improve pulmonary function and symptoms in 7 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia along with a rapid clearance of overactivated cytokine-secreting immune cells (CXCR3+CD4+ T cells, CXCR3+CD8+ T cells, and CXCR3+ NK cells), a decrease in TNF-Œ± circulating levels and an increase in CD14+CD11c+CD11bmid regulatory DC cells and IL-10 levels, compared with a placebo group (Leng et al., 2020).","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04333368","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Studies indicate that inflammation and cytokine storm might be involved in the pathophysiological pathway to ARDS in these patients. Corticosteroids have been tested in deferent scenarios of ARDS, including viral pneumonia, and the early use of dexamethasone is safe and appears to reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation in ARDS patients. A recent small retrospective study evaluating the role of corticosteroids found no association between corticosteroids and hospital length of stay, virus clearance, and symptoms' duration. However, the retrospective nature of data, small sample size (31 patients), and no protocol for corticosteroids administration undermine its results.

Interventions to decrease the incidence and severity of COVID-19 are emergently needed. Hydroxychloroquine (brand name, Plaquenil), an inexpensive anti-malarial medication with immunomodulatory effects, is a promising therapy for COVID-19. Chloroquine, a related compound with a less favorable toxicity profile, has shown benefit in clinical studies conducted in approximately one-hundred SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. In vitro, hydroxychloroquine has been recently shown to have greater efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 versus chloroquine. Currently, there is no established post-exposure prophylaxis for persons at high risk of developing COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine (brand name, Plaquenil), is a medicine that has been found to be effective against the novel coronavirus in some recent experiments. Previously, hydroxychloquine has been safety used to prevent malaria or to treat autoimmune diseases. This study will test if hydroxychloroquine may be used to prevent the development of COVID-19 symptoms in persons who live with an individual who has been diagnosed with COVID-19. If hydroxychloroquine is shown to reduce the risk of developing symptoms of COVID-19 among people at high risk of infection, this could help to reduce the morbidity and mortality of the COVID-19 epidemic.

In virological analyses of samples from the patients' deep respiratory tract, a novel coronavirus was isolated (first named 2019-nCoV, then SARS-CoV-2). The disease spread rapidly in the city of Wuhan in early 2020 and soon beyond. On 30 January 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, and on 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the virus a pandemic. In humans, an infection with the virus can cause respiratory infections and even very severe pneumonia, which often ends fatally, especially in old and previously ill patients. Due to the novelty of the virus, the data basis for therapy is very limited. To date, there are no clinical data for an effective specific therapy, nor is there a vaccination against the virus available, so that therapy, especially intensive care treatment for very severe cases, must concentrate only on supportive treatment of lung failure and other complications. The virus is very contagious and infection results in a relevant number of deaths. Due to very uncertain data on the spread of the virus in the population, it is difficult to estimate the mortality rate - case mortality is about 4% based on known case numbers. In reports on the treatment of the first cases in Wuhan (Hubei Province, China) in January 2020, the need for intensive care treatment is described for about a quarter of the inpatient cases, 10-17% had to be ventilated invasively, and venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vv-ECMO) was necessary in 2-4% of the inpatient cases. Patients requiring ECMO have an extremely high mortality rate of 83-100% in the studies described so far. In severe cases a pronounced release of vasoactive cytokines was repeatedly observed. Excessive release of these vasoactive mediators (\\cytokine storm\\\") can result in pronounced vasodilatation and membrane leakage, which can ultimately lead to severe vasoplegic shock that is difficult to control. Ruan et al. and Zhou et al. have identified high interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels as a potential predictor of a fatal outcome when compared between survivors and patients who died of COVID-19 disease. IL-6 is also an important factor in the pathophysiology of severe septic shock and excessive immune response in hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) - for both indications has been shown, that the extracorporeal adsorption of IL-6 and other vasoactive substances in a CytoSorb¬Æ adsorber (CytoSorbents Corporation, Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA) leads to a significant reduction of these cytokines in the patient blood. Clinical experience and (previously unpublished) data from our monocentric registry study show that cytokine adsorption in a CytoSorb¬Æ Adsorber can also be safely integrated into a vv-ECMO system. The aim of the study is to investigate the influence of extracorporeal cytokine adsorption on humoral inflammation parameters and patient survival under controlled conditions in patients with severe COVID-19 disease requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.\"","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04324528","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

In Italy, the scenario is progressively worsening with 8514 confirmed cases and 631 deaths at 10/3/2020. Along with the spread of this new virus there has been an increase in the number of pneumonia identified with the term novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (NCIP), which are characterized by fever, asthenia, dry cough, lymphopenia, prolonged prothrombin time, elevated lactic dehydrogenase, and a tomographic imaging indicative of interstitial pneumonia (ground glass and patchy shadows). Recent studies have shown the efficacy of vitamin C and thiamine administration in patients hospitalized for sepsis in the setting of intensive wards in terms of mortality reduction. The use of intravenously vitamin C arises from the experimental evidence of its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Vitamin C causes a greater proliferation of natural killers without affecting their functionality. Moreover, the vitamin C reduces the production of ROS (reactive oxygen species) that contribute to the activation of the inflammosomi and, in particular, the NLRP3 that affetcs the maturation and secretion of cytokines such as IL1beta and IL-18 that are involved in the inflammatory systemic syndrome that characterized sepsis. Vitamin C blocks the expression of ICAM-1 and activation of NFKappaB that are involved in inflammatory, neoplastic, and apoptotic processes by the inhibition of TNFalfa. For this reason, the use of vitamin C could be effective in terms of mortality and secondary outcomes in the cohort of patients with covid-19 pneumonia. In view of the emergency of SARS-VOC-2 and the impossibility of carrying out a randomized controlled study, it is their intention to conduct an intervention protocol (administration of 10 grams of vitamin C intravenously in addition to conventional therapy) involving the cohort of hospitalized patients with covid-19 pneumonia. Methods: An uncontrolled longitudinal study will be conducted at the Arnas Civico-di Cristina-Benfratelli National Relevance Hospital in Palermo. This study will include all patients consecutively hospitalized with positive swab test of SARS-CoV-2 and interstitial pneumonia or with interstitial pneumonia with indication of intubation. At the admission, data will be collected: personal and anamnestic information, clinical and laboratory findings such as Gender, Age, Ethnicity, Comorbidities, Drugs, blood urea nitrogen, Creatinine, Electrolytes, Blood cell count, Clearance of the lactates, PCR, PCT, SOFA score, liver function, Coagulation, Blood gas analysis, Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure, Sp02, Glycaemia, Body Mass Index (BMI). Length of hospital stay will be recorded. After written informed consent, 10 grams of vitamin C in 250 ml of saline to infuse at a rate of 60 drops / minute will be administered. In-hospital mortality, reduction of PCR levels > 50% in comparison with PCR levels at the admission within 72 hours after the administration, lactate clearance, length of hospital stay, resolution of symptoms, duration of positive swab (days). Resolution of the CT imaging will be analysed. Stata Statistical Software: Release 14.1.

(1,2) The exacerbated inflammatory response in COVID-19 infected critically ill patients calls for appropriate anti inflammatory therapeutics combined with antiviral effects. Thus, drugs combining anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects may reduce the symptoms of respiratory distress caused by COVID-19. This dual effect may simultaneously protect severely ill patients and reduce the viral load, therefore limiting virus dissemination. Naproxen, an approved anti-inflammatory drug, is an inhibitor of both cyclo oxygenase (COX-2) and of Influenza A virus nucleoprotein (NP). The NP of Coronavirus (CoV), positive-sense single-stranded viruses, share with negative-sense single-stranded viruses as Influenza the ability to bind to- and protect genomic RNA by forming self-associated oligomers in a helical structure with RNA. Naproxen was shown to bind the Influenza A virus NP making electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with conserved residues of the RNA binding groove and C terminal domain. (3) Consequently, naproxen binding competed with NP association with viral RNA and impeded the NP self-association process which strongly reduced viral transcription/replication. This drug may have the potential to present antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2 suggested by modelling work based on the structures of CoV NP. The high sequence conservation within the coronavirus family, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the present SARSCoV-2 coronavirus allows to perform this comparison. (4) A recent clinical trial shown that the combination of clarithromycin, naproxen and oseltamivir reduced mortality of patients hospitalized for H3N2 Influenza infection. (5). Inappropriate inflammatory response in CODIV-19 patients was demonstrated in a recent study where Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF? compared with non-ICU patients.(2) We suggest that naproxen could combine a broad-spectrum antiviral activity with its well-known anti inflammatory action that could help reducing severe respiratory mortality associated with COVID-19.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04325633","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

According to the WHO, Health-care workers (HCW) face an elevated risk of exposure to - and infection of Covid-19. Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) was developed as a vaccine against tuberculosis, but studies have shown its ability to induce potent protection against other infectious diseases: the so called non-specific effects (NSEs). A favorable in vitro or in vivo effect has been observed in studies for distinct viral pathogens, e.g. respiratory syncytial virus, yellow fever, herpes simplex virus; human papilloma virus. Based on the capacity of BCG to reduce the incidence of respiratory tract infections in children, to exert antiviral effects in experimental models; and to reduce viremia in an experimental human model of viral infection, the hypothesis is that BCG vaccination induces (partial) protection against susceptibility to and/or severity of Covid-19 infection. This study evaluates the efficacy of BCG to improve the clinical course of Covid-19 infection and to prevent absenteeism in order to safeguard continuous patient care. This randomized controlled trial has been designed as a pragmatic study with a highly feasible primary endpoint, which is unplanned absenteeism, that can be continuously measured on a bi-weekly basis). This allows for the most rapid identification of a beneficial outcome that would allow other HCWs to also benefit from the intervention if and as soon as it has been demonstrated to be effective.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04328441","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

The patients with low immunity have more serious conditions. At present, there is no specific drug/therapy available for COVID-19. NK cells are the major cells of the natural immune system, which are essential for innate immunity and adaptive immunity, and are indispensable in the defense of virus infection. NKG2D is an activating receptor of NK cells, which can recognize and thus clear virus infected cells. NK cells modified by CAR play a role in targeted cell therapy, and have benn demonstrated very safe without severe side effects such as cytokine releasing syndromes. The survival time of NK cells will be very short if there is no IL-15-sustained support after adoptive transfer into the body. In comparison with natural IL-15 in vivo, IL-15 superagonist (sIL-15/IL-15Rɑ chimeric protein) has increased the activity by nearly 20 times and as well as improved pharmacokinetic characteristics with longer persistence and enhanced target cytotoxicity. CAR-T cell-mediated cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity have been shown to be abrogated through GM-CSF neutralization. ACE2 is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and binds to S protein of the virus envelope. We have constructed and prepared the universal off-the-shelf IL15 superagonist- and GM-CSF neutralizing scFv-secreting NKG2D-ACE2 CAR-NK derived from cord blood. By targeting the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and NKG2DL on the surface of infected cells with ACE2 and NKG2D, respectively, and with the strong synergistic effect of IL15 superagonist and CRS prevention through GM-CSF neutralizing scFv, we hope that the SARS-CoV-2 virus particles and their infected cells can be safely and effectively removed, thus providing a safe and effective cell therapy for COVID-19. In addition, ACE2 CAR-NK cells can competitively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection of type II alveolar epithelial cells and other important organ or tissue cells through ACE2 so as to make SARS-CoV-2 abortive infection (i.e., no production of infectious virus particles).\n\nThis project is an open, randomized, parallel, multicenter phase I/II clinical trial. The NKG2D-ACE2 CAR-NK cells secreting super IL15 superagonist and GM-CSF neutralizing scFv are going to be give by intravenous infusion (108 cells per kilogram of body weight, once a week) for the treatment of 30 patients with each common, severe and critical type COVID-19, respectively.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04324996","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Pulmonary infections are the leading causes of ARDS. Clinical and experimental research has established a strong association between dysregulated systemic and pulmonary inflammation and progression or delayed resolution of ARDS. The COVID-19 pandemic is a critical moment for the world. Severe pneumonia is the main condition leading to ARDS requiring weeks of MV with high mortality (40-60%) in COVID-19 patients. There is no specific therapy for Covid-19, although patients are receiving drugs that are already approved for treating other diseases. There has been great interest in the role of corticosteroids to attenuate the pulmonary and systemic damage in ARDS patients because of their potent anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic properties. However, the efficacy of corticosteroids in viral ARDS remains controversial. We justify the need of this study based on the positive results of a recent clinical trial by our group, showing that dexamethasone for 10 days was able to reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) and increase hospital survival in patients with ARDS from multiple causes (Villar J et al.

This disease is not only a health problem but also economy, culture and the whole entity of the countries is under attack by the virus. This disease seems to affect the body in two different pathology pathways. From one side virus can decrease activity of immune system in the blood stream and whole body and from other side it can attack the respiratory cells. Tissue biopsy shows that immune cells penetrate into the Lung tissue and we have accumulation and over activity of Immune cells in the lung. This inflammation in respiratory tract probably is the major cause of Cytokine storm and release of TNF-α and IL-6 into the blood.\n\nIt seems that by three strategy disease can be treated. 1- By using systemic immune simulators. 2- By using topical anti-inflammatory drug in the respiratory system (Steroids or NSAIDs) 3- By inhibition of replication of the virus in the attacked cells.\n\nDetailed Description\n\nLooking at the pathology of this disease shows that COVID-19 virus binds to the Angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE II) which is located on the surface of different cells in the body and specially on the cells of respiratory system. This enzyme is responsible to turn angiotensin II into angiotensin1-7. It is also turns angiotensin I into angiotensin 1-9. When ACEII would be blocked by virus level of angiotensin II will be increased and this enzyme along with vasoconstriction, makes cells to manufacture TNF Œ± and IL-6 which are responsible for cytokine storm and Lymphopenia. Also presence of virus and virus shell on the surface of the infected cells make immune system to attack to the respiratory system hence effect of angiotensin II inside the cell causes fibrosis of the respiratory cells. This inflammation and tissue damage make Acute Respiratory Distress syndrome (ARDS) which is lethal for patients. There is a dilemma in treatment of this infection. From one side it doesn't make sense to decrease the immune response hence it will make the infection worse. And from other side stimulation of the immune response because of respiratory inflammation can expedite process of lethal ARDS. A new strategy for treatment of this disease which consists of local anti- inflammatory and systemic immune stimulant drugs can be considered as a reasonable strategy.As immunostimulator, Levamisole can increase Lymphocytes and empower the immunity of the body. This drug can also bind to Papaine Like Protease(PL-pro) of the shell of the virus which is necessary for virulence of COVID-19. It also can decrease level of TNF Œ± and IL-6, and as a chemical adjutant can introduce the virus to the immune system. In addition to Levamisole, Formoterol+Budesonide inhaler can be used in this protocol. Budesonide is a steroid and can suppress the immune reaction locally in the respiratory system. Formoterol is Œ≤2 agonist and can open airways. It also can bind to PL-pro and can neutralize the virus according to the published articles.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04331470","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

GMCSF, a pleiotropic cytokine, is an important leukocyte growth factor known to play a key role in hematopoiesis, effecting the growth and maturation of multiple cell lineages as well as the functional activities of these cells in antigen presentation and cell mediated immunity. Leukine inhalation or intravenous administration, as an adjuvant therapy, may confer benefit to patients with ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) due to COVID-19 exposure, who are at significant risk of mortality. While there is no active IND (Investigational New Drug) for Leukine in the proposed patient population, Leukine is being studied in Fase II as an adjuvant therapy in the management of life-threatening infections to boost the hosts innate immune response to fight infection, reduce the risk of secondary infection, and in varied conditions as prevention of infection during critical illness. Inhaled Leukine has also been successfully used as primary therapy to improve oxygenation in patients with disordered gas exchange in the lungs. We propose that based on preclinical and clinical data, Leukine inhalation, as an adjuvant therapy, has an acceptable benefit-risk for use in patients with hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS due to COVID-19 exposure, who are at significant risk of mortality. Confirmed COVID19 patients with hypoxic respiratory failure (saturation below 93% on minimal 2 l/min O2) will be randomized to receive sargramostim 125mcg twice daily for 5 days as a nebulized inhalation on top of standard of care, or to receive standard of care treatment.

This virus family causes upper respiratory tract disease and sometimes severe and fatal lung disease, as in the past: SARS-CoV and -MERS-CoV. Since the outbreak of the pandemic there has been a constant search for effective drug treatment for the disease. Following IN-VITRO evidence of the antiviral effect of CHLOROQUINE in CORONA viruses, this drug has been used empirically for COVID-19 patients and is currently recommended in Israel for the treatment of intermediate and severity disease. Currently, it is not common to treat patients with mild illness or asymptomatic carriers. In these situations, isolation is recommended until upper respiratory tract surfaces no longer show the presence of the virus, a period of approximately 20 days. . The mechanism of action of chloroquine is in part by inhibiting the virus distribution, and changing the intracellular acidity, the virus distribution site. The intracellular chloroquine concentration is determined by a pump called PGP that removes the drug from the cell and is activated by the drug. In the treatment of malaria, the benefit of low dosage of the drug has been shown to be effective due to the fact that the intracellular concentration of the drug is probably higher, and therefore the logic to examine this issue in COVID-19 treatment. The purpose of this study is to test whether a low dose of Chloroquine will reduce the duration of the viral shedding and prevent the disease from worsening. Reducing the duration of viral shedding, shortens the time when there is a risk that the person will spread the disease, and the time when the person is in isolation and cannot return to his normal life. The trial will be conducted in two stages, first in patients with mild-grade symptomatology disease , and then, depending on the results of the first phase, we will condider chloroquine therapy in asymptomatic patients (carriers only) to reduce the duration of viral shedding and prevent the onset of symptomatic disease. (Chloroquine dosage at this stage will be determined by the results of the first stage) In the first stage, patients will be recruited at a slight level and will compare two doses of chloroquine (low and normal) with stadard of care. In the second stage, we plan to examine asymptomatic carriers. Progress between Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the experiment will be contingent upon receiving a renewed approval from the Helsinki Committee, based on an interim report to be submitted. For the first study, patients diagnosed with COVID-19 patients will be recruited in a mild condition, with no background disease or drug therapy that endangers them with the side effects of chloroquine. We will monitor patients' clinical status and periodic PCR results from nasal and pharyngeal surfaces.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04333628","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

The elevated death risk estimates are probably associated with a breakdown of the healthcare system, indicating that enhanced public health interventions, including social distancing and movement restrictions, should be implemented to bring the COVID-19 epidemic under control.\\\" March 21st 2020 -Much of the United States is currently under some form of self- or mandatory quarantine as testing abilities ramp up.. March 24th, 2020 - Hot spots are evolving and identified, particularly in the areas of New York-New Jersey, Washington, and California Immediate attention is turned to testing, diagnosis, epidemiological containment, clinical trials for drug testing started, and work on a long-term vaccine started. The recovering patients are presenting with mild to severe lung impairment as a result of the viral attack on the alveolar and lung tissues. Clinically significant impairment of pulmonary function appears to be a permanent finding as a direct result of the interstitial lung damage and inflammatory changes that accompanied. This Phase 0, first-in-kind for humans, is use of autologous, cSVF deployed intravenously to examine the anti-inflammatory and structural potential to improve the residual damaged tissues. Previous utilization of cSVF remains in Clinical Trials at this moment for uses in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrotic Lung disorders, showing encouraging safety profile and clinical efficacy. It is the intention of this study, driven by the ongoing pandemic as a direct causative etiology for permanent lung damage within the oxygen/carbon dioxide exchange resulting the the direct alveolar disruption and scarring reaction. The inflammatory mediation, autoimmune modulatory capabilities, and revascularization potentials of the cSVF is becoming well recognized and documented in peer-reviewed literature and in scientific studies. Due to the urgency presented from the ongoing CoronaVirus pandemic, many patients that survive experience demonstrate direct pulmonary damage residua. There is available a relative new technology offered by Fluidda Inc in European Union (EU) known as \\\"Functional Respiratory Imaging (FRI) and examines pulmonary function and vascular capabilities in damaged lung tissues. This study examines the lung baseline (post-infection), and at 3 and 6 month intervals post-cSVF treatment to examine the functional airway configuration and efficiency at those intervals. Sporadic reports of use of stem cells or stem/stromal cells have revealed some positive clinical outcomes, although not within a traditional randomized trial format at this point in time. This study proposed in the specific situation of permanent residual dysfunction created by the SARS-Co2 (Coronavirus) infection is felt to warrant a pilot study using the cSVF that is in current Clinical Trials, which, at this point presents a very good safety profile with the absence of adverse event (AE) or severe adverse events (SAE) as yet reported by the trials.\"","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04326036","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

More than 400 articles have been published and more than 160 clinical trials are registered but no specific treatment has been successful as of March 2020. Antiviral drugs Lopinavir-Ritonavir did not show any significant benefit compared to standard care in a Chinese randomized controlled study with 199 patients. Even though the overall mortality is low (0.2-7.2% the figures from critical care are fearsome. Mortality rates have been reported as high as 90% in patients developing Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in early reports from the Wuhan province and more recent reports has reported overall 28-d mortality rates of 61,5% in ICU patients with acute respiratory illness (ALI), almost double the mortality of ARDS of any cause. ARDS associated with COVID-19 differs from other described ARDS with rapidly progressing respiratory failure and fibrosis. The mechanism behind the rapid progress is still an enigma but theories have evolved around severe inflammatory involvement with a cytokine storm. Macrophage activation is involved in the early phase of ARDS and cytokine modulators such as Interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitors have been tried in experimental settings but no proper clinical trials have proven positive outcome. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) significantly reduces inflammatory cytokines including IL-1Œ≤, IL-6 and TNF-Œ± through several transcription factors regulating inflammation, including Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 (HIF-1), Nrf2 and NFkB. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) has been used for almost a century, initially for decompression sickness, but it nowadays mainly used for its anti-inflammatory effects. Several randomized clinical trials have been conducted on humans for a variety of inflammatory diseases including diabetic foot ulcers and radiation injury. HBO is generally regarded as safe with very few adverse events. The broad and physiological anti-inflammatory effects of HBO shown in extensive experimental and clinical evidence suggest that HBO is a promising drug to ameliorate ARDS associated with COVID-19.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04327505","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

These patients often require intubation and ventilator support in order to sustain adequate oxygenation. Once a COVID-19 patient is intubated, Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) is a mainstay of treatment and is used in order to improve lung function, treat underlying atelectasis, improve oxygenation, and improve survival. In fact, early clinical data as well as reports from front line physicians treating COVID-19 suggest that PEEP has been the most effective treatment modality. In many cases, PEEP has resulted in improved oxygenation and improved survival. PEEP decreases the propensity for the alveoli to collapse by increasing the air pressure in the lungs. This residual pressure in the lungs at the end of exhalation decreases shunting and allows for more complete gas exchange and improved oxygenation. In patients, PEEP is one of the safest ways to increase PaO2 and is used on almost all modern ventilator settings. The GO2 PEEP MOUTHPIECE is a simple, comfortable, and straightforward mouthpiece with a bidirectional valve that effectively delivers PEEP with every breath. Early application of the GO2 PEEP MOUTHPIECE in non-intubated COVID-19 patients may improve outcomes and save lives. Furthermore, this device may allow for less strain on limited resources, especially ventilators. This PEEP mouthpiece could be employed under an oxygen non-rebreather mask to improve oxygenation and avoid intubation.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04331366","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

It has been designed in accordance with CONSORT guidelines. Randomization will be stratified by age (<50 and ‚â•50) and study site. Participants will be healthcare workers at risk for contracting SARS-CoV-2. Participants will be randomized into one of four arms: - Low-dose (300mg chloroquine base weekly); - Medium-dose (300mg chloroquine base twice weekly); - High-dose (150 mg chloroquine base daily); - Placebo. In all treatment arms, an induction dose of 1200mg chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine base (or equivalent number of placebo tablets in the placebo arm) will be taken in 4 divided daily doses (that is 300mg chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine base per day for four days) before starting the low, medium, or high dose regimen . In certain countries (especially where malaria is not endemic), hydroxychloroquine is more readily available and will be used instead of chloroquine. Based on in vitro studies and reviews of drug toxicity , we consider 150mg of hydroxychloroquine base to be equivalent to 150mg of chloroquine base in terms of efficacy. New dosage-based arm(s) might be added or removed. The trial will evaluate which of the intervention arms is most effective at decreasing the incidence of severe COVID-19 disease, without unacceptable side effects or safety events. Participants will complete weekly (smart phone- based) data logs, and follow- up information will be collected until 2 months after enrolment or death. In addition, where possible, we will use telemedicine approaches to collection information on participants. The study flow overview is outlined in Figure 4.

At the time of writing, there have been 150 000 confirmed cases and 3500 deaths. Apart from the morbidity and mortality directly related to COVID-19 cases, society has had to also cope with complex political and economic repercussions of this disease.\n\nAt present, and despite pressing need for therapeutic intervention, management of patients with COVID-19 is entirely supportive. Despite the majority of patients experiencing a mild respiratory illness a subgroup, and in particular those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, will experience severe illness that requires invasive cardiorespiratory support in the intensive care unit.\n\nFurthermore, the severity of COVID-19 disease (as well as the likelihood of progressing to severe disease) appears to be in part driven by direct injury to the cardiovascular system. Analysis of data from two recent studies confirms a significantly higher likelihood of acute cardiac injury in patients who have to be admitted to intensive care for the management of COVID-19 disease.\n\nThe exact type of acute of cardiac injury that COVID-19 patients suffer remains unclear. There is however mounting evidence that heart attack like events are responsible. Tests ordinarily performed to definitely assess for heart attacks will not be possible in very sick COVID-19 patients. Randomising patients to cardioprotective medicines will help us understand the role of the cardiovascular system in COVID-19 disease. It will also help us determine if there is more we can do to treat these patients.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04333407","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

The investigator will use plasma obtained from convalescent individuals with proven novel SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, diagnosed with coronavirus-19-induced disease and symptom-free for a period of not less than 10 days since they recovered from the disease. Donors will be screened for infectious diseases including sARS-CoV-2 and will be programmed for apheresis the next day. The investigaotr will process one plasmatic volume per donor and this will be guarded in the blood bank until required by the principal investigator. Patients or receptors will be screened and selected by the research team according to eligibility criteria, including severe disease refractory to treatment such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and other antivirals. Plasma will be fractioned in 250ml. Infusion will start after a clinical evaluation and blood sampling. Patients will remain under careful observation. If no adverse event is present, infusion will be repeated after 24 hours and the investigator will evaluate patients again 48 hours after the second transfusion.

We evaluate the role of hydroxychloroquine on respiratory viral loads. PATIENTS AND METHODS: French Confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in a single arm protocol from early March to March 16(th), to receive 600mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and their viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs was tested daily in a hospital setting. Depending on their clinical presentation, azithromycin was added to the treatment. Untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the protocol were included as negative controls. Presence and absence of virus at Day6-post inclusion was considered the end point. RESULTS: Six patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and eight had lower respiratory tract infection symptoms. Twenty cases were treated in this study and showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage at D6-post inclusion compared to controls, and much lower average carrying duration than reported of untreated patients in the literature. Azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination. CONCLUSION: Despite its small sample size our survey shows that hydroxychloroquine treatment is significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients and its effect is reinforced by azithromycin.","entry_type":"results_pub","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102549/","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Two Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kits based on recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (rN) and spike protein (rS) were used for detecting IgM and IgG antibodies, and their diagnostic feasibility was evaluated.Results: Among the 214 patients, 146 (68.2%) and 150 (70.1%) were successfully diagnosed with the rN-based IgM and IgG ELISAs, respectively; 165 (77.1%) and 159 (74.3%) were successfully diagnosed with the rS-based IgM and IgG ELISAs, respectively. The positive rates of the rN-based and rS-based ELISAs for antibody (IgM and/or IgG) detection were 80.4% and 82.2%, respectively. The sensitivity of the rS-based ELISA for IgM detection was significantly higher than that of the rN-based ELISA. We observed an increase in the positive rate for IgM and IgG with an increasing number of days post-disease onset (d.p.o.), but the positive rate of IgM dropped after 35 d.p.o. The positive rate of rN-based and rS-based IgM and IgG ELISAs was less than 60% during the early stage of the illness 0-10 d.p.o., and that of IgM and IgG was obviously increased after 10 d.p.o.Conclusions: ELISA has a high sensitivity, especially for the detection of serum samples from patients after 10 d.p.o, it can be an important supplementary method for COVID-19 diagnosis.","entry_type":"results_pub","url":"https://jcm.asm.org/content/early/2020/03/27/JCM.00461-20","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

This virus can infect the respiratory (breathing) system. Some people do not have symptoms but can carry the virus and pass it on to others. People who have developed the condition may develop a fever and/or a continuous cough among other symptoms. This can develop into pneumonia. Pneumonia is a chest infection where the small air pockets of the lungs, called alveoli, fill with liquid and make it more difficult to breathe.\nIn 2020, the virus has spread to many countries around the world and neither a vaccine against the virus or specific treatment for COVID-19 has yet been developed. As of March 2020, it is advised that people minimize travel and social contact, and regularly wash their hands to reduce the spread of the virus.\nCOVID-19 disproportionately affects people aged over 50 years with other illnesses and those over 65 years old. The infection causes considerable illness and the risk of death in this population group in particular and is having a devastating effect on people's health and society internationally. So far, there are no proven COVID-19 specific treatments. Most cases are being managed in the community. It is essential to identify treatments that reduce the severity of the infection. An ideal treatment would one that is safe, with few side effects, helps prevent disease worsening, and can be given in the community using existing NHS processes and capability. This study will, in the first instance, evaluate a drug called hydroxychloroquine. This is a drug that is already available within the NHS but that has not been tested for this disease in Europe or in community healthcare settings with the aim of reducing the need for hospital assessment.\n\nWho can participate?\nPatients with symptoms of possible COVID-19 (continuous cough and/or high temperature) that started within the last 7 days, either aged 65 and over, or aged 50 and over with the following listed illnesses: known weakened immune system due to serious illness or infection (e.g. chemotherapy), known heart disease, known asthma or lung disease, known diabetes not treated with insulin, known mild hepatic impairment, or known stroke or neurological problem.\n\nWhat does the study involve?\nParticipants are randomly allocated to undergo standard care or hydroxychloroquine drug treatment plus standard care. The study drug is hydroxychloroquine sulphate 200 mg tablets. The tablets are for oral use, one tablet (200 mg) taken twice daily for 7 days by mouth (14 tablets in total). This is the standard dose for its normal use in adults. Each dose should be taken with a meal or glass of milk. Antacids may reduce the absorption of hydroxychloroquine so it is advised that a 4-hour interval be observed between taking hydroxychloroquine and an antacid.\n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating?\nBy taking part in this study, participants will be contributing towards the understanding of how doctors can treat COVID-19 and how the symptoms progress. This may help to reduce the duration and severity of symptoms when people fall ill and reduce the burden on the NHS during this crisis. All participants will also receive a swab, and will be told if the swab is positive or not for COVID-19. With any medicine, including ones that are already used within the NHS, there is a risk of side effects. For the treatment in this study the common side effects include abdominal pain, decreased appetite, diarrhoea, headache, nausea, skin reactions, vision changes, and vomiting. Participants will be able to report whether they are experiencing any of these symptoms in the daily diary.\n\nWhere is the study run from?\nAll participating GP practices in England, managed by the University of Oxford Primary Care and Vaccines Clinical Trials Unit co-operative (UK)\n\nWhen is the study starting and how long is it expected to run for?\nMarch 2020 to March 2021\n\nWho is funding the study?\nOffice of the Chief Medical Officer (UK)\n\nWho is the main contact?\n1.

It started in a city in China and has now spread to several other countries around the world, including the United Kingdom. There is no vaccine or treatment for COVID-19 at the moment and governments are trying hard to stop it from spreading by making sure that infected people are identified as soon as possible and kept away from others. To know who has the infection you need to do a test and at the moment this is done in large laboratories within hospitals. Although laboratory testing is accurate, it takes a long time to get results back, leading to long delays in identifying positive cases and in identifying patients who are negative. Companies have developed tests for COVID-19 that can be performed outside of the laboratory and take just one hour to give a result. Having a rapid test result may allow doctors to identify infected patients much more rapidly and to stop the virus from spreading in hospitals. It may also identify those who are not infected much earlier allowing them to be taken out of isolation rooms earlier and sent home quickly, easing pressure on the NHS. Previous studies showed that rapidly testing for viruses close to the patient, rather than in laboratories, leads to improvement in patient care. The aim of this study is to find out whether using a new rapid test for COVID-19 performed near the patient leads to earlier decision making and better care for patients.\n\nWho can participate?\nPatients aged 18 and over with suspected COVID-19\n\nWhat does the study involve?\nPatients will have a nose and throat swab collected and tested immediately using the new rapid test (QIAstat-Dx Respiratory n-CoV Panel). Results are available in one hour and will be communicated immediately to clinical and infection control teams.

Previous studies on SARS have shown that type I interferons (such as IFN-α, IFN -β) can effectively inhibited the replication of SARS virus[Guido AntonelliThe Lancet ,2003]. However, IFN-α/β were considered to be related to the continuous inflammatory response of the host. Animal experiments suggested that IFN-α/β therapy induced influx of pathogenic inflammatory monocytes and vascular leakage, which would aggregate inflammatory damages. Furthermore, systemic adverse reactions of IFN-α/β would also be a source of concern. [Rudragouda ChannappanavarCell Host & Microbe ,2016]. IFN-κ is a relatively mild type I interferon, which can effectively inhibit the replication of envelope viruses without aggravating the inflammatory damage （Patent application No：201710668628.2 / PCT/CN2017/116350）. On the other hand, TFF2 is a small peptide with stable structure. Our work suggested that TFF2 protein reduced the morbidity and mortality of influenza virus infection by restricting the inflammatory response and promoting the repairment of respiratory mucosa. Therefore, TFF2 would also play an important role in the protection of new respiratory tract viral infections (such as Wuhan new coronavirus infection) （Patent application No：201610104936.8）. IFN-κ and TFF2 would work together in restricting the replication of the Co-V and reducing in situ pathological damage at the same time, which would be promising in curing respiratory diseases caused by nCo-V. Based on the above, we are planning a clinical trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of combined inhalation of IFN-κ and TFF2 in treatment of nCo-V-infected patients.

Clostridium Butyricum is a butyric acid-producing bacterium, which tolerate gastric acid and bile and colonize in the gut. Butyric acid, an important nutrient, can repair the damaged intestinal mucosa, eliminate inflammation and nourish the intestine. Clostridium butyricum promotes growth of probiotics, such as Bifidobacterium, and inhibits growth of pathogens, including Shigella. Bacillus Coagulans can tolerate gastric acid and bile. It ferments the lactic acid in the gut, where the concentration of oxygen is very low, to reduce intestinal pH value. In such a way, it inhibits growth of pathogens and promote growth of probiotics such as Bifidobactericum. Bacillus Coagulans can generate short chain fatty acid which can modulate host inflammation and promote immune tolerance against a variety of bacterial and viral pathogens. In 2008, the study of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in American demonstrated that higher representation of butyrate-producing bacteria in the fecal microbiota is associated with increased resistance against respiratory vial infection. It is also recommended in the Guideline for Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (5th version) that intestinal probiotics can maintain microbiota balance in the gut and prevent secondary bacterial infection. Therefore, 300 subjects will be included in the study. In addition to regular medication for NCP, subjects in the test group will take Live Clostridium Butyricum Capsules and Live Bacillus Coagulans Tablets for 14 days, and subjects in the control group will take regular medication for NCP. The objective of the study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of Live Clostridium Butyricum Capsules and Live Bacillus Coagulans Tablets in treatment of the NCP patients.

METHODS: We conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao(2)) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao(2)) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio(2)) of less than 300 mm Hg. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir-ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first. RESULTS: A total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir-ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group. Treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72). Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir-ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs. 25.0%; difference, -5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, -17.3 to 5.7). The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar. In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir-ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir-ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group. Lopinavir-ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir-ritonavir treatment beyond standard care. Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit.

The virus has since rapidly spread to all provinces and autonomous regions of China, and to countries outside of China. Patients who become infected with 2019-nCoV may initially develop mild upper respiratory tract symptoms. However, a significant fraction of these patients goes on to subsequently develop serious lower respiratory disease. The effectiveness of adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy uses in the management of 2019-nCoV infected patients with severe lower respiratory tract infections is not clear, and warrants further investigation. METHODS: The present study will be conducted as an open-labelled, randomised controlled trial. We will enrol 48 subjects from Chongqing Public Health Medical Center. Each eligible subject will be assigned to an intervention group (methylprednisolone via intravenous injection at a dose of 1-2mg/kg/day for 3 days) or a control group (no glucocorticoid use) randomly, at a 1:1 ratio. Subjects in both groups will be invited for 28 days of follow-up which will be scheduled at 4 consecutive visit points. We will use the clinical improvement rate as our primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints include the timing of clinical improvement after intervention, duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of hospitalization, overall incidence of adverse events, as well as rate of adverse events at each visit, and mortality at 2 and 4 weeks. DISCUSSION: The present coronavirus outbreak is the third serious global coronavirus outbreak in the past two decades. Oral and parenteral glucocorticoids have been used in the management of severe respiratory symptoms in coronavirus-infected patients in the past. However, there remains no definitive evidence in the literature for or against the utilization of systemic glucocorticoids in seriously ill patients with coronavirus-related severe respiratory disease, or indeed in other types of severe respiratory disease. In this study, we hope to discover evidence either supporting or opposing the systemic therapeutic administration of glucocorticoids in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.

Although the virus (SARS-Cov-2) nucleic acid RT-PCR test has become the standard method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, these real-time PCR test kits have many limitations. In addition, high false negative rates were reported. There is an urgent need for an accurate and rapid test method to quickly identify large number of infected patients and asymptomatic carriers to prevent virus transmission and assure timely treatment of patients. We have developed a rapid and simple point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay which can detect IgM and IgG antibodies simultaneously against SARS-CoV-2 virus in human blood within 15 minutes which can detect patients at different infection stages. With this test kit, we carried out clinical studies to validate its clinical efficacy uses. The clinical detection sensitivity and specificity of this test were measured using blood samples collected from 397 PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients and 128 negative patients at 8 different clinical sites. The overall testing sensitivity was 88.66% and specificity was 90.63%. In addition, we evaluated clinical diagnosis results obtained from different types of venous and fingerstick blood samples. The results indicated great detection consistency among samples from fingerstick blood, serum and plasma of venous blood. The IgM-IgG combined assay has better utility and sensitivity compared with a single IgM or IgG test. It can be used for the rapid screening of SARS-CoV-2 carriers, symptomatic or asymptomatic, in hospitals, clinics, and test laboratories. This article is protected by copyright.

The biochemical test showed abnormal increase in related indicators such as interleukin-8, and CT images showed a medical \"white\" lung\". According to the experience of SARS treatment in 2003, the use of hormones will indeed help the patients to alleviate their illness, but patients who survived SARS either had too much hormone at that time and took too long. Although the lungs could recover, but the femoral head was necrotic Either the amount of hormones was very conservative at the time, which kept the lungs in the storm of inflammatory factors, leading to the emergence of irreversible pulmonary fibrosis. So is there a medicine that can anti-inflammatory, reduce the load of hormone use, and have the effect of treating and preventing pulmonary fibrosis complicated by severe viral lung? At present, pirfenidone has achieved encouraging results in the treatment of idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (CTD-ILD) diseases. It is particularly encouraging that the values announced at the 2019 ATS Annual Conference suggest that pirfenidone has more anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects than its own outstanding anti-fibrotic ability. The data shows early use, Its strong anti-SOD activity can effectively inhibit IL-1beta and IL-4, and can open the prevention mode of pulmonary interstitial fibrosis. Based on the above, this project intends to make the following scientific assumptions: based on the homology of the pathogens of the new coronavirus-infected pneumonia and the coronavirus infection of pneumonia in 2003, the similarities in the occurrence and development of the disease, that is, the pulmonary inflammatory storm occurs first, and thereafter The progress of fibrosis and the progressive decline of lung function and mortality are higher than those of ordinary pneumonia. We hope that by adding pirfenidone as a treatment program in addition to standard treatment, it will be a new and severe type of coronavirus infection. Patient clinical treatment provides an effective and practical method.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nThis study is a multi-center, randomized, open, blank-controlled, multi-stage clinical study. As there are no effective treatments, the project team will evaluate possible treatments (including but not limited to Pirfenidone) based on actual conditions. Ketone, Pirfenidone, lopinavir / ritonavir, remdesivir, single / polyclonal antibodies against coronavirus), explore the most effective treatment options. The first phase will assess the efficacy and safety of approximately 147 (primarily estimated) hospitalized adult patients diagnosed with Wuhan new coronavirus infection in the pirfenidone-treated group compared to standard treatment. Patients with influenza within 14 days of onset of symptoms were screened and randomly assigned as soon as possible after screening (within 4 day). Patients will be allocated in a 1: 1 ratio and divided into the pirfenidone treatment group or the standard treatment group only. Patients who do not meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria are only allowed to be re-screened once, provided that the time from onset of symptoms to randomization remains within 14days. This study planned to randomize approximately 147 adult subjects. They will be stratified according to whether the onset time is ≤ 14 days and randomly divided into groups of 1: 1, receiving standard treatment or pirfenidone orally 3 times a day, 2 tablets each time. The course is 4 weeks or more. Subjects and all research center staff were not blinded. Study selection criteria: (1) Age ≥ 18 years. (2) Clinically diagnosed patients with new type of coronavirus pneumonia include: on the basis of meeting the criteria for suspected cases, one of the following pathogenic evidence: ① real-time fluorescent RT-PCR of respiratory specimens or blood specimens for detection of new coronavirus nucleic acid; Respiratory or blood specimens are genetically sequenced and highly homologous to known new coronaviruses.

The outbreak of SRAR-COV in China in 2003 caused serious social impact. From January 2002 to August 7, 2003, there were a total of 8,422 cases worldwide, involving 32 countries and regions, of which 919 cases were fatal, with a fatality rate of nearly 11%. The fatality rate of elderly patients and patients with underlying diseases was even more high.There is no precise and effective treatment for coronavirus infection. In vitro, IFN-α2β has inhibitory effects on MERS-CoV and closely related coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) -CoV. A study showed the effects of interferon-α2β and ribavirin on the replication of nCoV isolates hCoV-EMC / 2012 in Vero and LLC-MK2 cells. The combined application may be useful for the management of patients with nCoV infection in the future. At present, the combination therapy of interferon α2β and ribavirin has been successfully applied in the initial treatment and prevention of SARS and MERS.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of recombinant human interferon α1β in treating patients with new coronavirus infection in Wuhan.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nThis study is a multi-center, randomized, open, blank-controlled, multi-stage clinical study.

In severe cases, there will be rapid respiratory system failure. The novel coronavirus pneumonia is extremely contagious and the disease progresses rapidly. It has become a urgent and serious public health event that threatens human life and health globally. Among them, severe pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus is characterized by extensive acute inflammation of the lungs and the patient is critically ill. At present, there is no effective treatment in clinical practice.Most of them should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. For severe cases, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions. This clinical trial is to inspect the safety and efficiency of Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells (UC-MSCs) therapy for severe pneumonia patients infected with 2019-nCoV.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nSince December 2019, Wuhan has successively found multiple cases of patients with pneumonia infected by a novel coronavirus. With the spread of the epidemic, other cases in China and abroad have also found such cases. As of 24:00 on February 1, 2020, a total of 14,380 confirmed cases were reported in China, of which there were 2110 severe cases and 304 death cases. At present, there is no effective treatment for pneumonia in the clinic against new coronavirus infection, especially severe and critical cases. Therefore, it is of great significance to explore more active and effective therapeutic approach to severe pneumonia patients infected with 2019-nCoV. Human and animal studies have shown that after infection with coronavirus, the rapid replication of the virus in the body and the subsequent inflammatory response cause damage to alveolar epithelial cells and capillary endothelial cells, causing diffuse interstitial and alveolar edema, and pulmonary function. Impaired, leading to acute hypoxic respiratory insufficiency. The National Health and Medical Commission recently released the \"New Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan (Trial Version 5)\", which pointed out that the new type of coronavirus severe pneumonia usually has difficulty breathing after one week, and the severe cases quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, Septic shock and metabolic acidosis that is difficult to correct. It can be seen that the key to the treatment of new coronavirus severe pneumonia is to inhibit the super-inflammatory immune response caused by the virus, thereby reducing the damage of alveolar epithelial cells and capillary endothelial cells, and then repairing the structure and function of lung tissue. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are one of the most studied and important adult stem cells. A large amount of evidence shows that MSCs can migrate to and return to damaged tissues, exert strong anti-inflammatory and immune regulatory functions, promote the regeneration and repair of damaged tissues, resist apoptosis and inhibit tissue fibrosis, and reduce tissue damage. Many studies have shown that the anti-inflammatory effects of MSCs can significantly reduce virus-induced lung injury and mortality in mice. Studies have shown that MSCs can significantly reduce acute lung injury in mice caused by H9N2 and H5N1 viruses by reducing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and reducing the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the lungs. Compared with MSCs from other sources, human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (umbilical cord MSCs, UC-MSCs) have been widely used because of their convenient collection, no ethical controversy, low immunogenicity, fast self-renewal and strong proliferation ability Research on the treatment of various diseases.

The purpose of this study is to investigate efficiency and safety of UC-MSCs in treating severe pneumonia patients infected with 2019-nCoV.

In a short time, Chinese scientists had shared the genome information of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from these pneumonia patients and developed a real-time reverse transcription PCR (real time RT-PCR) diagnostic assay. Whilst the outbreak is likely to have started from a zoonotic transmission event associated with a large seafood market that also traded in live wild animals, it soon became clear that person-to-person transmission was also occurring. The number of cases of infection with 2019-nCoV identified in Wuhan increased markedly over the later part of January 2020, with cases identified in multiple other Provinces of China and internationally. Mathematical models of the expansion phase of the epidemic suggested that sustained person-to-person transmission is occurring, and the R-zero is substantially above 1, the level required for a self-sustaining epidemic in human populations. The clinical spectrum of 2019-nCoV illness appears to be wide, encompassing asymptomatic infection, a mild upper respiratory tract infection, and severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure and even death. Although the per infection risk of severe disease remains to be determined, case-fatality risk of 11-14% has been reported in several initial studies of seriously ill patients and case-fatality has been estimated approximately at 2% overall. Also the large number of cases in Wuhan has resulted in a large number of patients hospitalised with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen and sometimes more advance ventilator support. This new coronavirus, and previous experiences with SARS and MERS-CoV, highlight the need for therapeutics for human coronavirus infections that can improve clinical outcomes, speed recovery, and reduce the requirements for intensive supportive care and prolonged hospitalisation. Given no specific antiviral therapy for 2019-nCoV infection and the ready availability of remdesvir as a potential antiviral agent, based on pre-clinical studies in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, this randomized, controlled, double blind trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of remdesivir in patients hospitalized with severe 2019-nCoV respiratory disease.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04257656","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

There is a lack of effective targeted antiviral drugs, and symptomatic supportive treatment is still the current main treatment for SARI. Vitamin C is significant to human body and plays a role in reducing inflammatory response and preventing common cold. In addtion, a few studies have shown that vitamin C deficiency is related to the increased risk and severity of influenza infections. We hypothize that Vitamin C infusion can help improve the prognosis of patients with SARI. Therefore, it is necessary to study the clinical efficacy and safety of vitamin C for the clinical management of SARI through randomized controlled trials during the current epidemic of SARI.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nAt the end of 2019, patients with unexplained pneumonia appeared in Wuhan, China. At 21:00 on January 7, 2020, a new coronavirus was detected in the laboratory, and the detection of pathogenic nucleic acids was completed at 20:00 on January 10. Subsequently, the World Health Organization officially named the new coronavirus that caused the pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan as 2019 new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and the pneumonia was named severe acute respiratory infection (SARI). Up to February 4, 2020, over 20000 cases have been diagnosed in China, 406 of which have died, and 154 cases have been discovered in other countries around the world. Most of the deaths were elderly patients or patients with severe underlying diseases. SARI has caused global concern and emergency. Statistics of the 41 patients with SARI published in JAMA initially showed that 13 patients were transferred into the ICU, of which 11 (85%) had ARDS and 3 (23%) had shock. Of these, 10 (77%) required mechanical ventilation support, and 2 (15%) required ECMO support. Of the above 13 patients, 5 (38%) eventually died and 7 (38%) were transferred out of the ICU. Viral pneumonia is a dangerous condition with a poor clinical prognosis. For most viral infections, there is a lack of effective targeted antiviral drugs, and symptomatic supportive treatment is still the current main treatment. Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, has antioxidant properties. When sepsis happens, the cytokine surge caused by sepsis is activated, and neutrophils in the lungs accumulate in the lungs, destroying alveolar capillaries. Early clinical studies have shown that vitamin C can effectively prevent this process. In addition, vitamin C can help to eliminate alveolar fluid by preventing the activation and accumulation of neutrophils, and reducing alveolar epithelial water channel damage. At the same time, vitamin C can prevent the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps, which is a biological event of vascular injury caused by neutrophil activation. Vitamins can effectively shorten the duration of the common cold. In extreme conditions (athletes, skiers, art workers, military exercises), it can effectively prevent the common cold. And whether vitamin C also has a certain protective effect on influenza patients, only few studies have shown that vitamin C deficiency is related to the increased risk and severity of influenza infections. In a controlled but non-randomized trial, 85% of the 252 students treated experienced a reduction in symptoms in the high-dose vitamin C group (1g / h at the beginning of symptoms for 6h, followed by 3 * 1g / day). Among patients with sepsis and ARDS, patients in the high-dose vitamin group did not show a better prognosis and other clinical outcomes. There are still some confounding factors in the existing research, and the conclusions are different. Therefore, during the current epidemic of SARI, it is necessary to study the clinical efficacy and safety of vitamin C for viral pneumonia through randomized controlled trials.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04264533","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

In a short time, Chinese scientists had shared the genome information of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from these pneumonia patients and developed a real-time reverse transcription PCR (real time RT-PCR) diagnostic assay. Whilst the outbreak is likely to have started from a zoonotic transmission event associated with a large seafood market that also traded in live wild animals, it soon became clear that person-to-person transmission was also occurring. The number of cases of infection with 2019-nCoV identified in Wuhan increased markedly over the later part of January 2020, with cases identified in multiple other Provinces of China and internationally. Mathematical models of the expansion phase of the epidemic suggested that sustained person-to-person transmission is occurring, and the R-zero is substantially above 1, the level required for a self-sustaining epidemic in human populations. The clinical spectrum of 2019-nCoV infection appears to be wide, encompassing asymptomatic infection, a mild upper respiratory tract illness, and severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure and even death. Although the per infection risk of severe disease remains to be determined, and may differ from the initial reports of 10-15%, the large number of cases in Wuhan has resulted in a large number of patients hospitalised with pneumonia. Progression from prodromal symptoms (usually fever, fatigue, cough) to severe pneumonia requiring supplementary oxygen support, mechanical ventilation, or in some cases ECMO appears to occur most commonly during the second week of illness in association with persistent viral RNA detection. This provides a window of opportunity to test candidate antiviral therapeutics. This new coronavirus, and previous experiences with SARS and MERS-CoV, highlight the need for therapeutics for human coronavirus infections that can improve clinical outcomes, reduce risk of disease progression, speed recovery, and reduce the requirements for intensive supportive care and prolonged hospitalisation. In addition, treatments for mild cases to reduce the duration of illness and infectivity may also be of value were 2019-nCoV to become pandemic and/or endemic in human populations. Given no specific antiviral therapy for 2019-nCoV infection and the availability of remdesvir as a potential antiviral agent based on pre-clinical studies in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, this randomized, controlled, double blind trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of remdesivir in patients hospitalized with mild or moderate 2019-nCoV respiratory disease.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04252664","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

For severe cases, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions. This clinical trial is to inspect the safety and efficiency of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) therapy for pneumonia patients infected with 2019-nCoV.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\n2019-nCoV infection has become an urgent public health event in China. As of 24:00 on January 26, 2020, there are 2744 confirmed cases and 461 severe cases in China, the number is still increasing. There is currently no vaccine and no specific antiviral treatment recommended for 2019-nCoV infection. About 20% of the patients were severe and some died of respiratory failure or multiple organ failure. Therefore, it is urgent to find a safe and effective therapeutic approach to pneumonia patients infected with 2019-nCoV. In the last year, the promising features of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), including their regenerative properties and ability to differentiate into diverse cell lineages, have generated great interest among researchers whose work has offered intriguing perspectives on cell-based therapies for various diseases. These findings seem to highlight that the beneficial effect of MSC-based treatment could be principally due by the immunomodulation and regenerative potential of these cells. The investigators found that infusions of UC-MSC significantly improved liver function in decompensated liver cirrhosis and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) patients, increased the survival rate in acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) patients . MSCs could significantly reduce the pathological changes of lung and inhibit the cell-mediated immune inflammatory response induced by influenza virus in animal model . The purpose of this study is to investigate safety and efficiency of MSCs in treating pneumonia patients infected with 2019-nCoV. This multi-center trial will recruit 20 patients. 10 patients received i.v. transfusion one round (3 times) of 3.0*10E7 cells of MSCs as the treated group, all of them received the conventional treatment. In addition, the equal 10 patients received conventional treatment were used as control.

Meanwhile, five editions of \"Diagnosis and Treatment for Novel Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia\" has been timely and continuously issued, which play extremely important roles in guiding the clinical management of COVID-19 nationwide in China. The symptoms of human infection with SARS-CoV-2 are generally fever, fatigue, dry cough and dyspnea. Noteworthy, a considerable percentage of COVID-19 cases have rapidly progressed to severe and critical type, among which acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the most common complications, resulting in a large number of pneumonia hospitalized patients requiring supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or even ECMO.Pulmonary edema is a detrimental feature as well as a key causal factor of ALI/ARDS. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is considered as the most potent vascular permeability inducers.

In the SOLID-C19 study, Soliris (Eculizumab) will be used to modulate the activity of the distal complement preventing the formation of the membrane attack complex. By modulating this portion of the immune response, mortality can be halted while the patient has time to recover from the virus with supportive medical care.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nPatients affected with Covid-19 will be offered informed written consent. An FDA emergency IND form will be sent. Once approved, the patient will then be vaccinated with both the seronegative and quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines. Subsequently, antibiotic coverage against Nessieria Meningitis will be initiated and stopped no sooner than 2 weeks after the vaccinations were administered. The entire vaccination protocol should be completed. Soliris will be administered in the following manner: 900mg IV every 7 days for 4 weeks THEN 1200mg IV on the 5th week THEN 1200mg IV every 14 days ongoing until at least one month after the patient has recovered from the virus. Administration of Soliris as early as possible after diagnosis to prevent compliment mediated mortality & injury is ideal. Supportive care will continue during the administration of soliris Once recovered the patient's blood will be collected and sent for possible recovery of an antibody with the hopes that it may aid in the creation of a vaccine against Covid-19. Follow up at day 7, 14, and 28 after discharge.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04288713","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Studies show that in 2017, the number of sepsis patients worldwide reached as high as 48.9 million, of which eleven million patients died. Studies in China also showed that more than one million patients died of sepsis in 2015. Therefore, how to effectively reduce the mortality of patients with sepsis has become a focus of clinical and basic research. Previous studies have suggested that sepsis are often secondary to excessive inflammatory response syndrome. However, treatment measures targeting excessive inflammatory response failed to effectively improve the prognosis of patients. The reason is that sepsis-related immune dysfunction can increase the risk of secondary infection and even affect the fatality rate. The immune checkpoint pathway is the endogenous component of the immune system, which is responsible for checking the immune response and keeping it in a normal physiological state. Tumor cells can evade host recognition through this pathway. One of these immunocheckpoint pathways is the PD-1 and PD-L1 pathways. PD-1 is a receptor expressed on the surface of T cells and ACTS as a negative regulator of T cell function. Monoclonal antibody blocking the activity of PD-1 can successfully reduce tumor load and has been widely used in the clinical treatment of various tumors. The immune imbalance in patients with sepsis has many similarities tumors. PD-1 and PD-L1 are key mediators in T cell depletion in sepsis patients. Animal models have shown that blocking PD-1 or PD-L1 can prevent T cell death, regulate cytokine production, reduce organ dysfunction and reduce death in sepsis. Previous study showed the clinical safety of anti-PD-1 antibody in sepsis patients through randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Thymosin has also been proved to regulate cellular immunity in sepsis patients. Some studies have shown that thymosin can significantly reduce the mortality of sepsis patients. At present, phase III clinical research is in progress to further clarify the role of thymosin in patients with sepsis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of PD-1 and thymosin in patients with severe pneumonia associated with lymphocytopenia in 2019 novel coronavirus infection.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04268537","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

The primary efficacy parameters include the time to oxygen saturation recovery to normal level (≥97%), the proportion of patients with normal level of oxygen saturation after treatment, and the total duration of oxygen inhalation, oxygen flow change by time, oxygen concentration change by time during treatment.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nThe breakout of a new type of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) begun in Wuhan of Hubei province in China in December 2019, and as a result of its rapid spreading nationwide, as of February 16, 2020, a large number of people up to 68,500 totally in China were diagnosed with a new type of disease of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 1665 peoples were died due to this disease in China. Based on the recent epidemiological investigation, the incubation period of this new coronavirus is 1-14 days and 3-7 days for most people before they show any symptom, such as fever, fatigue and dry cough that are the main clinical symptoms a few patients will also show nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat and diarrhea and other symptoms. Severe patients often have dyspnea and/or hypoxemia 1 week after onset of the disease, and the rapid progression for these patients include acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, refractory metabolic acidosis and coagulation dysfunction. According to the \"Guidance of Diagnosis and Treatment for Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Procedural Version 5 Amendment)\" recently issued by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, the general treatment will include close monitoring vital signs and oxygen saturation at finger, additionally, monitoring routine blood test, routine urine test, coagulation function, arterial blood gas analysis based on individual condition, and providing effective oxygen inhalation treatment (including nasal catheter, mask oxygen supply and transnasal high flow oxygen therapy) in time. T89 have the effects of activating blood circulation and removing blood stasis, regulating Qi and relieving pain. Four clinical trials conducted in China and abroad have shown that T89 can effectively alleviate the clinical symptoms of acute high altitude reaction, improve blood oxygen saturation, significantly increase the exercise time in treadmill and metabolic equivalents of task and enhance exercise tolerance under hypoxic environment. Modern pharmacological and gene network-based studies have shown that T89 can improve the oxygen carrying capacity of red blood cells, increase oxygen saturation, effectively reduce the injury of major organs such as heart, brain, lung and kidney caused by hypoxia, and prevent the decrease of oxygen saturation by improving the energy metabolism disorder caused by hypoxia. At the same time, T89 can inhibit the reduction of hematocrit, albumin leakage, neutrophil CD18 and adhesion factor of endothelial cells (ICAM-1), by which T89 has a good therapeutic effect on microcirculation disorders caused by many diseases. In conclusion, T89 can improve the ability of carrying oxygen of red blood cells, increase the oxygen saturation, effectively reduce the injury of heart, brain, lung and kidney and other major organs caused by hypoxia, and it can significantly improve the microcirculation disorder. At the same time, in the \"Guidance for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Atypical Pneumonia (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromes, SARS) P (2003 edition)\" has also recommended T89 can be used as a traditional Chinese patent medicine to treat patients of advanced stage and severe SARS lung asthma syndrome by its effect of promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis. In conclusion, T89 can improve the oxygen saturation and the clinical symptoms of patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), as a result, there may be some benefits for these patients to use T89 in current clinical treatment. This exploratory treatment clinical study is to investigate the effect of T89 on improving oxygen saturation and clinical symptoms in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), with the study design characterized by open-label, randomized and blank-control. In this study, an estimated total of 120-240 male and female patients aged 18-85 years old who have been diagnosed with coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), not including critical type in severity, will be enrolled and randomly assigned to one of two study groups, the T89 treatment group and the blank control group, to receive T89 or nothing for up to 14 days on the base of a standard treatment recommended by the\"Guidance of Diagnosis and Treatment for Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Procedural Version 5 Amendment) . As planned, this study will be started before March 2020 in hospitals located in Wuhan of Hubei province in China and completed at the end of next June 2020.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04285190","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

During the coding process, DM can question the investigator online in real time about failure of coding caused by improper, inaccurate or ambiguous medical terms provided. A medical review is required for the medical coding before the database lock. 1.6External data management NA 1.7Data review meeting The study leader, statistician and data manager make the data review before statistical analysis to review the subject completion, protocol violation, adverse events, analysis data sets (including FAS, PPS and SS) to determine the attribution of each subject, judgment of missing value and treatment of outliers. Decisions made on the review meeting cannot be modified after the database lock, and any decisions must be documented. 1.8Electronic signature of investigator After the database is frozen, the investigator conducts electronic signature verification and shall sign the name again in case of data revision after signature. 1.9Data lock and export After the data in the database meets the quality requirements, a written approval document of database lock is signed by the data manager, statistical analyst and investigator representative according to the database lock procedures, exported by the data manager to the database of specified format and submitted to the statistician for statistical analysis. 2. Statistical analysis See the \"Statistical analysis plan\" for the details of the statistical analysis. The statistician and the principal investigator finalize the plan according to the data characteristics through discussion before the database lock. This protocol only describes the basic statistical analysis content, and the actual content shall be subject to the statistical analysis plan. 2.1Analysis data set 2.1.1Full Analysis Set (FAS): a set of all cases randomized to use the study drug at least once. 2.1.2Per Protocol Set (PPS): a data set generated by subjects who have fully complied with the trial protocol, including treatment received, availability of primary endpoint measurement, and no significant violation of the trial protocol. Cases withdrawn due to inefficacy will also be included in PPS. PPS will be subject to the final classification of the data audit report. 2.1.3Safety Set (SS): a set of subjects who receive at least one treatment with a safety evaluation after randomization. 2.2Missing data processing method 2.2.1The subjects who have missing primary efficiency indicators are filled in according to the treatment failure, that is, the pathogen nucleic acid testing in throat swabs, urine and stool on Days 7-14 after administration does not convert to negative. Unless otherwise specified, the secondary efficiency indicators shall be included as observed data in the statistical analysis, and the missing data shall not be filled in. 2.2.2The safety data shall not be filled in. 2.3Statistical method 2.3.1General principle Description of statistics: The primary indicators collected in this study are described with statistical method. Quantitative indicators are described by means of mean, standard deviation, median, quartile, maximum, minimum and the like; qualitative indicators are described by frequency, percentage and the like. Statistical test: Unless otherwise specified, the statistical significance level is 0.05 by two-sided test (one-sided 0.025) and the 95% confidence interval shall be provided for the estimation of inter-group variance parameters. 2.3.2Characteristics of cases Subject distribution The population and the number of enrolled and completed cases in each center are listed, and three analysis data sets (FAS, PPS, SS) are determined. A detailed list of the data set categories is made. The number and ratio of subjects who are randomly enrolled, complete the trial, and withdraw from the trial early and the reasons are calculated. The subject distribution flow chart is plotted. General information and baseline characteristics The demographic information, previous medication history and history of other diseases of the patients are described with statistical method. General information and baseline characteristics are described based on FAS. 2.3.3Analysis of drug exposure and drug combination Analysis based on SS. The drug exposure, dose intensity and exposure time of each group are calculated and subject to descriptive statistical analysis. The drug combination is coded by WHO ATC and summarized according to the ATC secondary classification and PT. The number and ratio of cases are calculated. 2.3.4Efficiency analysis Analysis based on FAS and PPS. Primary efficiency indicators: The primary effective indicators are complete antipyresis time, pulmonary imaging improvement indicators, and negative conversion ratio of pathogen nucleic acid testing in throat swabs, urine and stool on Days 7-14 after administration.The non-inferiority evaluation is based on FAS. The statistical significance level is set to one-sided 0.025 and the non-inferiority critical value is set to -10%. The negative conversion ratio of pathogen nucleic acid testing in throat swabs, urine and stool on Days 7-14 after administration in the trial group and positive control group is calculated respectively. The negative conversion ratio difference (trial group - control group) between the trial group and positive control group as well as the two-sided 95% confidence interval (95%CI) are calculated. The confidence interval is estimated by Miettinen-Nurminen. If the lower limit of 95% confidence interval for the negative conversion ratio difference between the trial group and control group is greater than -10%, it is considered that the trial drug for the indication is not inferior to the positive control drug. Given that the non-inferiority hypothesis is true, if it is further obtained that the lower limit of 95% confidence interval for the negative conversion ratio difference between the trial group and control group is greater than 0, it is considered that the trial drug for the indication is superior to the positive control drug. The inter-group ratio difference and confidence interval estimation results after the site effect control will be provided simultaneously as the sensitivity analysis and the sites with few subjects may be combined before analysis. Secondary efficiency indicators: The secondary efficiency indicators include negative conversion ratio of pathogen nucleic acid testing on Day 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14 after administration, negative conversion time, immune-related indicators (lymphocyte count, lymphocyte percentage, counts and percentages of CD4 and CD8), SOFA score, white blood cell count and C-reactive protein. The secondary efficiency indicators are subject to descriptive statistical analysis according to the data type. Where, for the quantitative data, the observed values in each visit and the changes in the observed values from baseline after treatment are analyzed descriptively and provided with the inter-group difference estimate value (trial group - control group) of the changes in indicators in different visits from baseline and its 95% confidence interval; for the qualitative data, the indicators in different visits are described in the form of a frequency table (frequency and percentage) and provided with the inter-group ratio difference and confidence interval estimate; for the survival data, such as the negative conversion time of pathogen nucleic acid testing and complete antipyresis time, the median complete antipyresis time and its 95% confidence interval in each group are calculated by Kaplan-Meier, the information on the subject deletions at the end of the study is provided and the survivorship curve is provided. The hazard ratio HR and its 90% confidence interval of the trail group and the control group are estimated by Cox proportional hazards regression. 2.3.5Safety analysis SS data sets are used for safety analysis.

No specific anti-viral treatment exists. The mainstay of clinical management is largely symptomatic treatment, with organ support in intensive care for seriously ill patients. Cellular therapy, using mesenchymal stem cells has been shown to reduce nonproductive inflammation and affect tissue regeneration and is being evaluated in patients with ARDS. This clinical trial is to inspect the safety and efficiency of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) therapy for severe COVID-19.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nThe epidemic of 2019 novel coronavirus (causing the disease Covid-19) has expanded from Wuhan throughout China and is being exported to a growing number of countries, some of which have seen onward transmission. COVID-19 caused clusters of severe respiratory illness and was associated with 2% mortality. There is currently no vaccine and no specific antiviral treatment recommended for COVID-19. About 20% of the patients were severe and the mainstay of clinical management is largely symptomatic treatment, with organ support in intensive care for seriously ill patients. Therefore, it is urgent to find a safe and effective therapeutic approach to COVID-19. In the last years, the promising features of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), including their regenerative properties and ability to differentiate into diverse cell lineages, have generated great interest among researchers whose work has offered intriguing perspectives on cell-based therapies for various diseases. These findings seem to highlight that the beneficial effect of MSC-based treatment could be principally due by the immunomodulation and regenerative potential of these cells. MSCs could significantly reduce the pathological changes of lung and inhibit the cell-mediated immune inflammatory response induced by influenza virus in animal model . MSCs has been shown to reduce nonproductive inflammation and affect tissue regeneration and is being evaluated in patients with ARDS. Our phase I preliminary data of parallel assignment study(NCT04252118) showed that three doses of MSCs was safe in patients with COVID-19. Randomized control trial are needed to assess efficacy and safety. The investigators will do a prospective, double-blind, multicentre, randomised trial to assess treatment with three intravenous doses of MSCs compared with placebo. 90 severe COVID-19 patients will be recruited in China. 60 patients receive i.v. transfusion 3 times of MSCs（ 4.0*10E7 cells per time), as the treated group, all of them receive the conventional treatment. In addition, the 30 patients receive placebo and conventional treatment were used as control.

Patients will be randomized to intravenous Aviptadil with escalation to nebulized Aviptadil vs. nebulized Aviptadil with escalation to intravenous Aviptadil.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nAcute Respiratory Distress Syndrome is a known lethal complication of Corona Virus (COVID-19) infection. Conventional medical therapy, including intensive care and respiratory support is associated with a 35%-50% mortality. Aviptadil, a synthetic form of Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP) has been awarded FDA Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of ARDS. Nonclinical studies demonstrate that VIP is highly concentrated in the lung, where it prevents NMDA-induced caspase-3 activation in the lung, inhibits IL6 and TNFa production, protects against HCl-induced pulmonary edema, These and other effects have been observed in numerous animal model systems of lung injury in mice, rats, guinea pigs, sheep, swine, and dogs. In these models, Aviptadil restores barrier function at the endothelial/alveolar interface and thereby protects the lung and other organs from failure. Aviptadil is approved for human use in Europe and has a demonstrated 20 year history of safety in numerous trials for Sarcoid, Pulmonary Fibrosis, Bronchospasm, Erectile Dysfunction, and a phase I trial in ARDS. Five phase 2 trials have been conducted under European regulatory authority. Numerous healthy volunteer studies have shown that i.v. infusion of Aviptadil is well tolerated with few adverse effects including alterations in blood pressure, heart rate, or ECG. In addition to published studies of human use, Aviptadil has been used on a compounded basis in certain ICUs for many years in the belief that it preserves life and restores function in pulmonary hypertension, ARDS, and Acute Lung Injury (ALI). In this study, patients who are hospitalized and intubated for ARDS secondary to COVID-19 infection will be randomly allocated to Aviptadil administered by intravenous infusion, nebulization via the endotracheal tube, and both IV and endotracheal administration. Primary endpoints will be improvement in blood oxygenation and mortality.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04311697","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

SARS-CoV-2 is a RNA virus that display high similarity in both genomic and proteomic profiling with SARS-CoV that first emerged in humans in 2003 in China. Therefore, preventing and controlling the pandemic occurrences are extremely urgent as a global top priority. Due to the lack of effective antiviral drugs, patients may be treated by only addressing their symptoms such as reducing fever. Clinical autopsies from SARS-CoV-infected patients demonstrated that there were major pathological changes in the lungs, immune organs, and small systemic blood vessels with vasculitis. However, the detection of SARS-CoV were primarily found in the lung and trachea/bronchus, but was undetectable in spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow, heart and aorta, highlighting the overreaction of immune responses induced by viral infection were really harmful, resulting in the pathogenesis of lungs, immune organs, and small systemic blood vessels. To this respect, immune modulation strategy may be potentially beneficial to enhance anti-viral immunity and efficiently reduce the viral load, improve clinical outcomes, expedite the patient recovery, and decline the rate of mortality in patients after being infected with SARS-CoV-2. Tianhe Stem Cell Biotechnologies Inc. has developed a novel globally-patented Stem Cell Educator (SCE) technology designed to reverse the autoimmune response in Type 1 diabetes (T1D), Alopecia Areata (AA) and other autoimmune diseases. SCE therapy uses human multipotent cord blood stem cells (CB-SC) from human cord blood. Their properties distinguish CB-SC from other known stem cell types, including mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Several clinical studies show that SCE therapy functions via CB-SC induction of immune tolerance in autoimmune T cells and restore immune balance and homeostasis in patients with T1D, AA and other inflammation-associated diseases. To correct the overreaction of overreaction of immune responses, the investigators plan to treat SARS-CoV-2 patients with Stem Cell Educator therapy.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nThis is a prospective, two-arm, partially masked, single center clinical study to assess the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of SCE therapy for the treatment of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Some patients rapidly progressed and suffered severe acute respiratory failure and died, making it imperative to develop a safe and effective vaccine to treat and prevent severe Covid-19 pneumonia. Based on detailed analysis of the viral genome and search for potential immunogenic targets, a synthetic minigene has been engineered based on conserved domains of the viral structural proteins and a polyprotein protease. The infection of Covid-19 is mediated through binding of the Spike protein to the ACEII receptor, and the viral replication depends on molecular mechanisms of all of these viral proteins. This trial proposes to develop universal vaccine and test innovative Covid-19 minigenes engineered based on multiple viral genes, using an efficient lentiviral vector system (NHP/TYF) to express viral proteins and immune modulatory genes to modify artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPC) and to activate T cells. In this study, the safety and immune reactivity of this aAPC vaccine will be investigated.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nBackground: The 2019 discovered new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is an enveloped positive strand single strand RNA virus. The number of SARS-CoV-2 infected people has increased rapidly and WHO has warned that the pandemic spread of Covid-19 is imminent and would have disastrous outcomes. Covid-19 could pose a serious threat to human health and the global economy. There is no vaccine available or clinically approved antiviral therapy as yet. This study aims to evaluate the safety and immune reactivity of a genetically modified aAPC universal vaccine to treat and prevent Covid-19. Objective: Primary study objectives: Injection of Covid-19/aAPC vaccine to volunteers to evaluate the safety. Secondary study objectives: To evaluate the anti- Covid-19 reactivity of the Covid-19/aAPC vaccine. Design: 1. Based on the genomic sequence of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, select conserved and critical structural and protease protein domains to engineer lentiviral minigenes to express SARS-CoV-2 antigens. 2. The Covid-19/aAPC vaccine is prepared by applying lentivirus modification including immune modulatory genes and the viral minigenes, to the artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPCs). The Covid-19/aAPCs are then inactivated for proliferation and extensively safety tested. 3. The subjects receive a total of 5x10^ 6 cells each time by subcutaneous injection at 0, 14 and 28 days.

At present, there are no proven interventions to prevent progression of the disease. Some preliminary data on SARS pneumonia suggest that inhaled Nitric Oxide (NO) could have beneficial effects on SARS-CoV-2 due to the genomic similarities between this two coronaviruses. In this study we will test whether inhaled NO therapy prevents progression in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 disease.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nTo date, no targeted therapeutic treatments for the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak have been identified. Antiviral combined with adjuvant therapies are currently under investigation. The clinical spectrum of the infection is wide, ranging from mild signs of upper respiratory tract infection to severe pneumonia and death. In the patients who progress, the time period from symptoms onset to development of dyspnea is reported to be between 5 to 10 days, and that one to severe respiratory distress syndrome from 10 to 14 days. Globally, 15 to 18% of patients deteriorates to the need of mechanical ventilation, despite the use of non-invasive ventilatory support in the earliest phases of the disease. Probability of progression to end stage disease is unpredictable, with the majority of these patients dying from multi-organ failure. Preventing progression in spontaneously breathing patients with mild to moderate disease would translate in improved morbidity and mortality and in a lower use of limited healthcare resources. In 2004, during the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak, a pilot study showed that low dose ( max 30 ppm) inhaled NO for 3 days was able to shorten the time of ventilatory support.

No proven vaccine is available to protect healthcare workers against SARS-CoV-2. This study will enroll 260 healthcare professionals dedicated to care for patients with proven SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subjects will be randomized either in the observational (control) group or in the inhaled nitric oxide group. All personnel will observe measures on strict precaution in accordance with WHO and the CDC regulations.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nIn their efforts to provide care for patients with novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) infection, many healthcare workers around the globe exposed to SARS-CoV-2 got infected and died over the past two months. Quarantined nurses and physicians have become the norm in regions with COVID-19 patients, putting at risk the overall functionality of the regional healthcare system. Other than strict contact-precautions, no proven vaccination or targeted therapy is available to prevent COVID-19 in healthcare workers. Inhaled nitric oxide gas (NO) has shown in a small clinical study to have antiviral activity against a Coronavirus during the 2003 SARS outbreak. We have designed this study to assess whether intermittent inhaled NO in healthcare workers might prevent their infection with SARS-CoV-2. Background: After almost two months of fight against COVID-19 infection, on February 24, more than 3,000 physicians and nurses were reported as contracting COVID-19 disease in Wuhan (China). Fatalities among those healthcare workers were reported to be related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Implementation of strict contact protections for all healthcare personnel is essential to decrease and contain the risks of exposure. However, despite best efforts, dozens of thousands of healthcare providers have been quarantined for at least 14 consecutive days in Wuhan alone. Similarly data have been reported in Italy, several healthcare providers have been quarantined, developed pneumonia and died. Most recent information from Italy reported that 12% of healthcare workers are infected. The shortage of hospital personnel, especially in the critical care and anesthesiology domains, led many hospitals to postpone indefinitely scheduled surgical procedures, including cardiac surgery or oncological procedures. Only urgent and emergent cases are performed in patients without symptoms (i.e., absence of fever, cough or dyspnea), no signs (i.e., negative chest CT for consolidations, normal complete blood count) and a negative test on SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase (rt)-PCR. If time does not allow for thorough screening (i.e., after traumatic injury), such patients are considered to be infected and medical staff in the OR are fully protected with third degree protections (i.e., N95 masks, goggles, protective garments and a gown and double gloving). Rationale. In 2004 in a collaborative study between the virology laboratory at the University of Leuven (Belgium), the Clinical Physiology Laboratory of Uppsala University (Sweden) and the General Airforce Hospital of China (Beijing, China), nitric oxide (NO) donors (e.g. S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine) greatly increased the survival rate of infected eukaryotic cells with the coronavirus responsible for SARS (SARS-CoV-1), suggesting direct antiviral effects of NO. These authors suggest that oxidation is the antiviral mechanism of nitric oxide. A later work by Akerstrom and colleagues showed that NO or its derivatives reduce palmitoylation SARS-CoV spike (S) protein affecting its fusion with angiotensin converting enzyme 2. Furthermore, NO or its derivatives reduce viral RNA synthesis in the infected cells. Future in-vitro studies should confirm that NO donors are equally effective against SARS-CoV-2, as the current virus shares 88% of its genome with the SARS-CoV [3]. However, at present it is reasonable to assess that a high dose of inhaled NO might be anti-viral against SARS-CoV-2 in the lung. The virus is transmitted by human-to-human contact and occurs primarily via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes within a range of about 1.5 meters. The incubation period ranges from 1 to 14 days with an estimated median incubation period of 5 to 6 days according to the World Health Organization [1]. COVID-19 disease is mainly a respiratory system disease, but in the most severe forms can progress to impair also other organ function (i.e., kidneys, liver, heart). Nitric oxide gas inhalation has been successfully and safely used for decades (since 1990) in thousands of newborns and adults to decrease pulmonary artery pressure and improve systemic oxygenation. Recently at the Massachusetts General Hospital, a high dose of inhaled NO (160 ppm) for 30 - 60 minutes was delivered twice a day to an adolescent with cystic fibrosis and pulmonary infection due to multi-resistant Burkholderia cepacia. There were no adverse events to this patient, blood methemoglobin remained below 5% and lung function and overall well-being improved. Clinical Gap. Thousands of healthcare workers have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and contracted COVID-19 despite their best efforts to prevent contamination. No proven vaccine is available to protect healthcare workers against SARS-CoV-2. Hypothesis. Due to genetic similarities with the Coronavirus responsible for SARS, it is expected that inhaled NO gas retains potent antiviral activity against the SARS-CoV-2 responsible for COVID-19. Aim. To assess whether intermittent delivery of inhaled NO gas in air at a high dose may protect healthcare workers from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Observational group: a SARS-CoV-2 rt-PCR will be performed once a week. Treatment group: the subjects will breathe NO at 160 parts per million (ppm) for two cycles of 15 minutes each at the beginning of each shift and before leaving the hospital. A SARS-CoV-2 rt-PCR will be performed once a week. Safety: Oxygenation and methemoglobin levels will be monitored via a non-invasive CO-oximeter. If methemoglobin levels rise above 5% at any point of the gas delivery, inhaled NO will be stopped. NO2 gas will be monitored and maintained below 5 ppm. Blinding. The treatment is not masked.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04312243","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to standard of care or standard of care with the addition of therapy with chloroquine.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nChloroquine is one of two therapeutics (in addition to remdesivir) that has demonstrated in vitro inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2 and the drug is immediately available from national pharmacies. No delay is accordingly expected in treatment initiation after study commencement. In light of the evidence supporting chloroquine as a promising therapeutic in patients with COVID-19, the expected impact of the current proposal is considerable both in the short- and long-term. If successful, treatment with chloroquine has the potential to be the first evidence based treatment for COVID-19. The drug is affordable and the risk of side effects is low, making it an attractive therapeutic in large proportions of the population on a global scale. In the current proposal aims to investigate the virological and clinical effects of chloroquine treatment in patients with established SARS-CoV-2 in need of hospital admission. The investigators hypothesize that early treatment with chloroquine in patients with established COVID-19 is safe and will significantly improve prognosis and impact clinical outcomes. More specifically, the investigators hypothesize that early treatment with chloroquine will increase the virological clearance rate of SARS-CoV-2, and lead to more rapid resolve of clinical symptoms, decreased proportion of patients with clinical deterioration and a decreased admission rate to intensive care units and in-hospital mortality. Considering the immediate and worldwide health emergency associated with the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and the current lack of evidence based medical interventions for this patient group, studies investigating such possible treatment modalities in COVID-19 are direly needed. The study is a two-arm, open label, pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to assess the virological and clinical effect of chloroquine therapy in patients with established COVID-19. Pragmatic clinical trials are characterized by focus on informing decision-makers on optimal clinical medicine practice and an intent to streamline procedures and data collection in the trial. By utilizing resources already paid for by the hospitals (physicians and nurses in daily clinical practice), pragmatic clinical trials can include a larger number of patients at a short time duration and at a lower cost. Due to the immediate need for study commencement and the time frame of the current proposal, a pragmatic approach will enable swift initiation of randomization and treatment. Data will be extracted from the data warehouse at Akershus University Hospital for eligible patient identification (i.e. electronic surveillance) and for automatic data extraction to the study specific database. The study will not be able to procure an acceptable placebo treatment and the study will accordingly not be placebo-controlled. All patients at Akershus University Hospital with suspicion of acute respiratory tract infections are examined with a nasopharyngeal swab, with subsequent microbiological examination, including SARS-CoV-2 specific RT-PCR. Participants will be recruited from the entirety of the inpatients at the participating hospitals. Electronic real-time surveillance of laboratory reports from the Department of Microbiology will be examined regularly, with maximum interval 24 hours, for SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects. The study aims to include patients by a sequential adaptive approach, where analyses are planned after the inclusion of 51 patients, with subsequent analyses after 101, 151 and 202 completed patients. All patients included in each sequence will be used for the final analyses of the entire study. This approach will enable frequent assessment of all outcome measures. Data will be collected from the hospital electronic record system, including electronic patient records, laboratory and medical imaging systems, and prescribing systems. The data warehouse at Akershus University Hospital will be utilized for automatic data extraction to the study specific database. All clinical variables will be registered in the study eCRF system, including clinical endpoints and quantitative virological results from serial nasopharyngeal specimens.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04316377","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

The follow up period is 15 days.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nAs the newest global medical emergency, the COVID-19 (diagnosed SARS-CoV2 infection with lung involvement) exhibits features that are unlikely ameliorated by antivirals-based approaches alone. First, although the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infect lung and intestine, many patients suddenly take a turn for the worse even when the viral replication appears to be under control. Second, patients with serious or critical clinical symptoms show remarked T cell lymphopenia that are more severe and more acute than human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Functional exhaustion of T cells is suggested by high expression of T-cell exhaustion markers, which again appears more acute than in HIV patients. Third, multiple cytokines are elevated among patients with severe clinical symptoms, which potentially explains the multiple organ failure associated with COVID-19. For these reasons, treatment of COVID-19 likely requires a combination of both antivirals and non-antivirals-based approaches. CD24Fc is a biological immunomodulator in Phase II/III clinical trial stage. CD24Fc comprises the nonpolymorphic regions of CD24 attached to the Fc region of human IgG1. We have shown that CD24 is an innate checkpoint against the inflammatory response to tissue injuries or danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that CD24Fc effectively address the major challenges associated with COVID-19. First, a Phase I clinical trial on healthy volunteers not only demonstrated safety of CD24Fc, but also demonstrated its biological activity in suppressing expression of multiple inflammatory cytokines. Second, in Phase II clinical trial in leukemia patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT), three doses of CD24Fc effectively eliminated severe (Grade 3-4) acute graft vs host diseases (GVHD), which is caused by over reacting immune system and transplanted T cells attacking recipient target tissues. Third, in preclinical models of HIV/SIV infections, we have shown that CD24Fc ameliorated production of multiple inflammatory cytokines, reversed the loss of T lymphocytes as well as functional T cell exhaustion and reduced the leukocyte infiltration of multiple organs. It is particularly noteworthy that CD24Fc reduced the rate of pneumonia in SIV-infected Chinese rhesus monkey from 83% to 33%. Therefore, CD24Fc maybe a prime candidate for non-antiviral biological modifier for COVID-19 therapy. The phase III trial will involve 230 patients randomized into blinded placebo and CD24Fc arms, with time to clinical improvement from severe to mild symptom as the primary endpoint.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04317040","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

The investigators can evaluate to stop the test however before the six months if there are no new cases of COVID-19 for at least 21 days in the region where the enrolled patients live. The test in use is the VivaDiag ™ COVID-19 lgM / IgG Procedure (as per the protocol in use for the administration of the test) 1. take out the test kit and leave it at least 30 minutes in the room where the test will be performed. 2. place the test equipment on a clean and dust-free surface 3. First insert 10µL of whole blood or serum or plasma in the area reserved for blood (in the well) present on the test, then apply 2 drops of buffer. 4. read the result after 15 minutes Interpretation of test results Positive result 1. The anti-COVID-19 lgM antibody is detected if: the quality control band C and the lgM band are both colored and the lgG band does not stain. This means that the anti-COVID-19 lgM antibody is positive. 2. The anti-COVID-19 lgG antibody is detected if: the quality control band C and the lgG band are both colored and the lgM band does not stain. This means that the COVID-19 lgG antibody is positive. 3. The lgG and lgM anti-COVID-19 antibodies are detected if: the C band, the lgG band and the lgM band are all three colored. This means that the anti-COVID-19 lgG and lgM antibodies are both positive. Negative result The anti-COVID-19 lgG and lgM antibodies are not detected if only the quality control C band is stained but the lgG and lgM bands are not colored, this means that the test is negative. Invalid result If the quality control band C does not color, regardless of whether the lgG and lgM bands are colored or not, the result is invalid and the test must be started again.
