This study will adjust the dose of hydroxychloroquine using therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to a goal concentration known to be safe. The observation period for TDM will be a total of up to 10 days or until the time of ICU discharge, which ever is sooner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs is routine practice at the RBWH ICU, TDM will be led by the senior ICU pharmacist after initiation of therapy.
