This clinical trial aims to evaluate the outcome of WMT combining with standard therapy for patients with 2019-novel coronavirus pneumonia, especially for those patients with dysbiosis-related conditions.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nAn ongoing outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan, China. 2019-nCoV has caused a cluster of pneumonia cases, and posed continuing epidemic threat to China and even global health. Unfortunately, there is currently no specific effective treatment for the viral infection and the related serious complications. It is in urgent need to find a new specific effective treatment for the 2019-nCoV infection. According to Declaration of Helsinki and International Ethical Guidelines for Health-related Research Involving Humans, the desperately ill patients with 2019-nCov infection during disease outbreaks have a moral right to try unvalidated medical interventions (UMIs) and that it is therefore unethical to restrict access to UMIs to the clinical trial context. There is a vital link between the intestinal tract and respiratory tract, which was exemplified by intestinal complications during respiratory disease and vice versa. Some of these patients can develop secondary bacterial infections and antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). The recent study on using washed microbiota transplantation (WMT) as rescue therapy in critically ill patients with AAD demonstrated the important clinical benefits and safety of WMT. Additionally, the recent animal study provided direct evidence supporting that antibiotics could decrease gut microbiota and the lung stromal interferon signature and facilitate early influenza virus replication in lung epithelia. Importantly, the above antibiotics caused negative effects can be reversed by fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) which suggested that FMT might be able to induce a significant improvement in the respiratory virus infection. Another evidence is that the microbiota could confer protection against certain virus infection such as influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus by priming the immune response to viral evasion. The above results suggested that FMT might be a new therapeutic option for the treatment of virus-related pneumonia. The methodology of FMT recently was coined as WMT, which is dependent on the automatic facilities and washing process in a laboratory room. Patients underwent WMT with the decreased rate of adverse events and unchanged clinical efficacy in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. This clinical trial aims to evaluate the outcome of WMT combining with standard therapy for patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia, especially for those patients with dysbiosis-related conditions.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04251767","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

Patient navigation is a barrier focused, long-term patient-centered intervention that offers support for a defined set of health services. The intervention under investigation is a comprehensive postpartum patient navigator program. Women who are randomized to receive patient navigation will be compared to women who are randomized to receive usual care. Navigators will support women through one year postpartum. The NNM2 program will be grounded in understanding and addressing social determinants of health in order to promote self-efficacy, enhance access, and sustain long-term engagement. Participants will undergo surveys, interviews, and medical record review at 4-12 weeks and 11-13 months postpartum. The investigators will additionally conduct focus groups and surveys with clinical providers.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nThe postpartum period - often called the \"fourth trimester\" - is a time of rapid and intense change in the life of a woman and her family, and uptake of health care during this transition is critical to optimizing women's long-term health and the health of their subsequent pregnancies. The importance of postpartum care has been reinforced by professional organizations, yet postpartum care in the United States remains inadequate. Substantial racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in health care uptake, quality, and outcomes exist. Improving health for all women requires the development of new, more comprehensive approaches to postpartum and interconceptional care. One potential model may be patient navigation, which is a barrier-focused, longitudinal, patient-centered intervention that offers support for a defined set of health services.\n\nThis protocol is to evaluate whether implementation of a postpartum patient navigation program improves health outcomes among low-income women. The investigators previously developed a postpartum patient navigation program, called Navigating New Motherhood (NNM), which introduced a clinic-level intervention in which a patient navigator assumed postpartum supportive and logistical responsibilities for low-income women. Navigation was associated with improvements in outcomes (retention in care, contraception uptake, vaccination, and depression screening) compared to those of a historical cohort. The investigators now propose to test the efficacy of the updated NNM model - called \"NNM2\" - via a randomized trial. The study will randomize 400 pregnant or postpartum women (1:1) with publicly-funded prenatal care to NNM2 versus usual care. Women randomized to navigation will be provided intensive, individualized, one-on-one navigation services through 12 weeks postpartum and, based on individual needs, ongoing, tapered navigation through one year postpartum. The NNM2 program will be grounded in understanding and addressing social determinants of health in order to promote self-efficacy, enhance access, and sustain long-term engagement. Participants will undergo surveys, interviews, and medical record review at 4-12 weeks and 11-13 months postpartum.\n\nAim 1 will evaluate whether the navigation program improves clinical outcomes at 4-12 weeks postpartum as measured via a composite of health status that includes retention in care, receipt of recommended counseling, receipt of desired contraception, postpartum depression screening/care, breastfeeding initiation/maintenance, and receipt of preventive care. Sub-Aims will include investigation of outcomes at 11-13 months postpartum. Aim 2 will evaluate whether NNM2 improves patient-reported outcomes. Aim 3 additionally involves examining obstetric and primary care provider perspectives on the navigation program and on optimizing the postpartum transition. Completion of this study will fill an evidence gap by demonstrating whether postpartum patient navigation is an effective mechanism to improve women's short- and long-term health, enhance health care utilization, and improve patient and provider satisfaction.\n\nNNM2 suspended enrollment due to COVID-19 beginning March 16, 2020. For already enrolled individuals, study visits and patient navigation activities were converted to tele-research and tele-navigation. Recruitment will resume when the COVID-19 pandemic resolves and normal outpatient care has resumed. For individuals already recruited, the outcomes definitions described below have been appropriately modified for the conduct of telemedicine during the pandemic.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT03922334","is_covid":"no","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

This is because the amount and types of foods in the diet eat can affect a person's weight, and because different foods are metabolised (processed) by the body in different ways.\n\nScientists have also found that the bacteria in the human gut (the gut microbiome) affect their metabolism, weight and health and that, together with a person's diet and metabolism, could be used to predict appetite and how meals affect the levels of sugar (glucose) and fats (lipids) found in blood after eating. If blood sugar and fat are too high too often for too long, there is a greater chance of developing diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe gut microbiome is different in different people. Only 10-20% of the types of bacteria found in the human gut are found in everyone. This might mean that the best diet to prevent disease needs matching to a person's gut microbiome and it might be possible to find personalised foods or diets that will help reduce the chance of developing chronic disease as well as metabolic syndrome.\n\nThe study investigators are recruiting volunteers aged 18-70 years to take part in a study that aims to answer the questions above. Participants will be asked to consume standardised meals on up to 8 days while wearing glucose monitors (Abbott Freestyle Libre) to measure their blood sugar levels. Participants will also be required to prick their fingers at regular intervals to collect small amounts of blood, and to record their appetite, food, physical activity and sleep using apps and wearable devices. They will be asked to collect a fecal and saliva sample before consuming the standardised meals, and to provide a fasted blood sample at the end of the study period.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nChoice of design: The study is a single arm mechanistic intervention study.\n\nStudy population: Participants will be recruited through online and offline advertisements, and through health professionals.\n\nScreening Assessment: Prospective participants will be selected based on the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria by the study management team. Screening will be online and via phone. Prospective participants will be booked in to start their study period and will receive a study kit by post.\n\nStudy duration: Each participant will take part in the study for a period of up to 12 days.\n\nDietary intervention: The dietary intervention will be carried out on up to 8 days within the 12-day study period. On day one, participants will be asked to collect biological samples and fit wearable devices (glucose monitor and physical activity tracker). Over the following consecutive days, each participant will be instructed to eat up to 8 standardised meals for breakfast, which must be their first meal of the day. On up to 3 of the days the participants will also be asked to eat a standardised lunch. Participants are free to eat whatever they wish at all other times. The standardised meals will be provided to all participants by the study team via post. The foods included as part of these meals will be foods that are commonly consumed and can be made from products sold in US supermarkets. Participants will be reassured that the amount of food will be designed to ensure a stable body weight over the course of the study. Participants will be asked to consume the entire amount of food indicated for the standardised meals and to record any left-over food via a digital app for which training will be provided at the start of the study. Following completion of standardised meal days, participants are free to eat and drink whatever they wish and will be asked to track all meals, snacks and drinks on their digital app. Participants will also be advised not to change their physical activity patterns during the course of the study. The 12th day of the study involves a visit to a medical clinic where participants will provide a fasted blood sample.\n\nRegular contact will be made with the participants via phone, their app and text messages for the period of the intervention to encourage compliance and answer any queries.\n\nAnthropometry: The participant will be instructed to measure their weight, height, waist and hip circumference.\n\nDietary and Lifestyle: Participants will be asked to complete a baseline questionnaire online, as well as a diet history questionnaire with portion sizes about the month preceding their study period. They will be asked to record on a daily basis their dietary, activity, and psychological data (e.g. hunger) using a digital mobile phone app. Lifestyle information (such as sleep and exercise) will be monitored using digital wearable devices. Training in all apps and equipment will be given through written and online instructions and via communications with the study support staff.\n\nDigital devices: Participants will be asked to record daily dietary and activity information using digital apps and lifestyle information will be monitored using digital wearable devices. The continuous glucose monitor (Freestyle Libre, CGM) provides continuous glucose profiles for up to 14 days. The CGM will be inserted on the back of the upper arm, one day before participants begin dietary intervention. This will measure subcutaneous interstitial fluid glucose concentrations every 5 minutes. The CGM will be removed at the end of the intervention period by the participant. A contact number will be made available to participants for any inquiries or if any problems arise. Data from the CGM will be downloaded, and glucose profiles will be evaluated on the basis of data collected.\n\nBlood samples: The participant will collect postprandial blood on 2 days using finger-prick blood sampling. They will also provide a fasted blood sample after the study period to measure their baseline metabolomic profile.\n\nDigital app: Participants will be asked to download an app designed specifically for this study, which provides diet & activity logging functionality similar to widely used existing apps such as MyFitnessPal.\n\nParticipants will be asked to record and monitor the following information via the digital app and wearable devices, on a daily basis:\n\nAll food and drink they consume, with serving sizes and photos\nSleep and physical activity patterns, including exercise\nHunger and alertness ratings\nPsychological feeling of energy and mood\nPrescription and over-the-counter drug consumption\n\nThe app will be available in versions for both iOS and Android operating systems, and will support a wide range of mobile phone models as expected across the participant population. The app will synchronise remotely with backend database servers, over an encrypted and authenticated API, and will support offline operation for when patients wish to record an entry without network coverage. This continuous background synchronization means that it will not be necessary to explicitly download data from the phone at the end of the study.\n\nFollowing the 2020 pandemic of COVID-19, participants are asked to use the COVID-19 Symptom Tracker app to record their physical health symptoms, or lack thereof, attributable to COVID-19, as well as demographic and other health information to track the spread of disease in real time, and to potentially reveal risk factors for infection and severe illness.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT03983733","is_covid":"no","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Reconsolidation of Traumatic Memories (RTM) is a novel treatment that seeks to alter key aspects of the target memory (e.g., color, clarity, speed, distance, perspective) to make it less impactful, and reduce nightmares, flashbacks, and other features of PTSD. The memory is reviewed in the context of an imaginal movie theater, presenting a fast (~45 sec) black and white movie of the trauma memory, with further adjustment as needed so the patient can comfortably watch it. Open and waitlist studies of RTM have reported high response rates and rapid remission, setting the stage for this randomized, controlled, single-blind trial comparing RTM versus prolonged exposure (PE), the PTSD therapy with the strongest current evidence base.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that RTM will be non-inferior to PE in reducing PTSD symptom severity post-treatment and at 1-year follow up; will achieve faster remission, with fewer dropouts; will improve cognitive function; and that epigenetic markers will correlate with treatment response. The investigators will randomize 108 active or retired service members (SMs) with PTSD to ≤10 sessions of RTM or PE, affording power to test our hypotheses while allowing for ≤ 25% dropouts. The investigators will use an intent to treat analysis, and the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition, or DSM5 (CAPS-5), conducted by blinded assessors, will be the primary outcome measure. Secondary measures of depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), sleep (PSQI), and functional status (WHOQOL-100), will be assessed pre- and post-treatment, and at 2, 6, and 12 months. ANOVA will compare symptom severity over time within and between groups. Blood draws will be obtained pre- and posttreatment to assess predictors of treatment response and epigenetic markers of change. The NIH Toolbox Neurocognitive Assessment, pre- and post-treatment, will assess impact on cognitive function. The investigators will track comorbid TBI, anticipating it will not adversely impact response. More effective therapies for PTSD, with and without TBI, must be developed and evaluated. RTM is safe and promising, but requires testing against evidence-based interventions in well-designed randomized clinical trials (RCTs). The full study can now be conducted via video conferencing due to COVID-19.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nPrimary Objective: The primary intent of this study is to determine whether Reconsolidation of Traumatic Memories (RTM) achieves a greater and/or more rapid response than prolonged exposure (PE) in the treatment of military service members with PTSD. This is an interventional randomized controlled trial in which all participants will receive active psychotherapy for PTSD, either what is currently considered the best-evidenced treatment, prolonged exposure, or a novel approach, reconsolidation of traumatic memories, that the investigators believe can achieve a higher response rate that will also prove more rapid and more durable. Participants will be active duty, reserve or National Guard service members, or former service members who were retired either medically or for length of service, who are eligible for care in the Department of Defense Healthcare System. Our findings should be generalizable to current and former military service members with PTSD.\n\nApproach This is a randomized controlled trial, enrolling 108 SMs with active PTSD, to RTM and PE, with up to 10 treatment sessions in each arm. The anticipated average enrollment rate will be 2 new participants per week. Participants may be male and female adult (ages 18+) participants who are active, reserve component, National Guard, or retired SMs; those with active suicidal or homicidal ideation, or a history of a psychotic disorder, will be excluded. Participants may have a history of lifetime mild or moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI), or no TBI history, but no lifetime history of severe TBI. Given that most participants are expected to be referred from the Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine (CNRM)'s Military Recruitment Protocol, it is anticipated that the great majority will have comorbid mild TBI (mTBI). All participants will also complete a total of 5 assessment visits: at baseline, immediately after the course of treatment, and at 2, 6 and 12 months. The baseline visit will begin with the completion of informed consent, followed by the administration of a series of questionnaires, a detailed neurocognitive assessment, and a blood draw; serial assessment will occur throughout the intervention period and for 12 months of follow-up. Participants will be randomly assigned to PE or RTM using a random number generator in MS Excel or other program to generate a random sequence of 108 zeroes and ones as a list. Subjects will be assigned to the treatment arms from that list: all zeros will be assigned to RTM and ones to PE.\n\nHypotheses: Military service members with PTSD who are randomized to Reconsolidation of Traumatic Memories (RTM) therapy will be significantly more likely to achieve PTSD resolution than those randomized to Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy, measured by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM5 (CAPS-5, by expert assessors blinded to treatment group assignment). The investigators also anticipate that RTM will achieve a response more rapidly, and will prove more durable. Among the secondary measures that will correlate with response to therapy are epigenetic changes, inflammatory biomarkers, neurocognitive function, and measures of depression, anxiety, sleep quality, and overall functional status. Primary Aim: Compare response rates of PTSD to RTM vs. PE, defined by remission of diagnosis on the CAPS-5, using a 2-tailed t-test, from baseline to post-intervention. The investigators will also utilize repeated measures ANOVA to compare CAPS-5 scores at baseline, post-intervention, and at 2-, 6-, and 12-month follow up within groups. In addition to this primary measure, the investigators will also use independent sample t-tests to document the efficacy of randomization by comparing the two groups' baseline CAPS-5 total scores, along with PCL5, PHQ-9, NSI, GAD-7, PSQI, WHOQOL-10, NIH-Toolbox Neurocognitive Assessment Composite Score, biomarker levels, number of TBIs, and all other demographic variables.\n\nSecondary Aim 1: Corroborate impact on PTSD symptom severity by measuring changes in CAPS-5 and PCL5, respectively, from baseline to post-treatment for RTM and PE, using a 2-tailed t-test. The investigators will then use repeated measures ANOVA to compare within and between group changes in the CAPS-5 at baseline, post-treatment, 2-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up for the CAPS-5, and these as well as scores obtained prior to treatment sessions 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 for the PCL5.\n\nSecondary Aim 2: Compare rapidity of improvement in PTSD symptom severity between RTM and PE, measured by PCL5 scores at baseline, prior to treatment sessions 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10, and post-treatment, using a log-rank test to compare Kaplan-Meier curves for two groups.\n\nSecondary Aim 3: Compare the durability of response to treatment, with the primary measure being the percentage meeting criteria for PTSD on the CAPS-5, at post-treatment, and at 2-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups, using repeated measures ANOVA between the two groups. The investigators will also determine whether this is corroborated by symptom severity reduction by comparing the CAPS-5 and PCL5 scores at these time points, again using repeated measures ANOVA.\n\nSecondary Aim 4: Compare the impact of RTM and PE upon comorbid conditions by using ANOVA with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons, to compare scores at baseline, post-treatment, and each of the follow-up time-points, on postconcussive symptoms (NSl), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), sleep (PSQI), and functional status (WHOQOL-100).\n\nSecondary Aim 5: Compare key biomarker responses between RTM and PE. Cytokine concentrations (IL-6, IL-10, TNF) and DNA methylation rates with ANOVA with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons. The investigators will also conduct exploratory analyses to determine whether there are particular biomarkers that appear to be associated with response to the intervention, as opposed to nonresponse, within and across treatment groups.\n\nSecondary Aim 6: Compare neurocognitive function in response RTM and PE, using NIH Toolbox Composite Score changes from baseline to post-treatment with a 2-tailed t-test. Exploratory analyses will assess compare responders vs. non-responders on the composite score and the 7 tasks comprising the NIH-TB to assess whether there may be particular aspects of cognitive function that may be more likely to respond to one form of treatment as opposed to the other.\n\nDue to COVID-19 the full study can now be conducted by video conferencing, though without the NIH-TB or blood draw.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT03827057","is_covid":"no","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

In several countries there is a shortage of ICU beds and ventilators. Critically ill patients are treated outside ICUs. Doctors are facing ethical dilemmas who they should treat with ventilation, who should receive ventilator and who should but will not.

In several countries there is a shortage of ICU beds and ventilators. Critically ill patients are treated outside ICUs. Doctors are facing ethical dilemmas who they should treat with ventilation, who should receive ventilator and who should but will not.\n\nBefore pandemic in ICUs there had always been patients who required mechanical ventilation because of extrapulmonary reasons as well as palliative cases or those in vegetative condition. Most of these patients require just a simple ventilator, not a sophisticated mode of ventilation. Some attempts to invent a device that could replace complex machines in patients with anticipated poor outcome have been made. Ventil was used in clinical scenarios for separate lung ventilation with good effect. VENTIL device, a flow divider, theoretically allows for independent, fully automated synchronous ventilation of 2 patients with use of only one respirator. In the shortage of respirators (ex. terrorist attack, natural disasters) device allows also to ventilate in classical system two patients using single respirator.\n\nVentil - independent lung ventilation system was constructed by engineers from Nalecz Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering of Polish Academy of Science. Ventil was tested in the clinical scenario - it's safety had been confirmed. Several years ago the working prototypes of the device, after approval of Ethical Committee, was tested in about 150 patients, who were ventilated with independent synchronous lung ventilation and had been found useful.\n\nThe idea of the study is to check the usefulness of the device (modern version) in ICU patients who can be ventilated with volume -controlled mode of ventilation as an attempt to use single device for ventilation of 2 patients. At this moment, according to several scientific societies, sharing mechanical ventilators should not be attempted because it cannot be done safely with current equipment. However, it is possible that using a designed flow divider will allow safe ventilation in patients without needs for complicated modes of ventilation.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether a novel simpler to device, the automated bag-valve-mask (BVM) compressor, can be used to provide assisted ventilation temporarily to patients in need. This includes patients with COVID-19 lung infection and respiratory failure. If successful, this would increase the pool of total available ventilator hours to alleviate any shortage.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nThis study will be performed in the emergency department and ICU's of Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). Thirty patients requiring mechanical ventilation will be enrolled. The design is a case series with repeated measures analysis. All patients will receive the experimental treatment as well as conventional ventilation and unassisted oxygenation as observed prior to initiation of mechanical ventilation. The compressor used will be manufactured by Spiro LLC / 10xbeta based on the open source MIT design. The device is powered by an uninterrupted power supply from a standard electrical outlet and it alarms if unplugged.\n\nThe patient will be moved into a negative pressure room. After patients with respiratory failure are intubated and stabilized on a conventional ventilator, they will receive 15 minutes of artificial respirations with the automated compressor with the conventional ventilator standing by. They will be returned to the conventional respirator after this period, or sooner if necessary. The endotracheal tube will be briefly clamped during the rapid transition from one device to another to minimize aerosolization of any viral particles and to retain any PEEP.\n\nIf the initial study period demonstrates successful respiratory support, then the procedure may be repeated once with doubling of the automated compressor treatment time to 30 minutes.

The majority of patients (8 out of 10) are known to have mild disease, manifested by respiratory tract symptoms associated with fever, headache, and body pain. However, it is possible that the disease progresses to a severe stage, whith the need for mechanical ventilation support associated with high morbidity and mortality. The progression of the disease is mainly due to the appearance of uncontrolled inflammation that also favors the development of disseminated clots. So far, there is no effective treatment to combat coronavirus; however, the use of anti-inflammatory drugs is potentially effective in preventing complications from the disease. In this regard, low dose colchicine is relatively safe and effective as an anti-inflammatory. It has been used for many years in the control of inflammation secondary to the accumulation of uric acid crystals. The aim of this study is to test if the administration of colchicine at a dose of 1.5 mg the first day and subsequently 0.5 mg BID until completing 10 days of treatment is effective as a treatment for inflammation related symptoms in patients with mild and severe disease secondary to coronavirus infection. The primary outcome is improvement of symptoms related to inflammation and avoiding progression to severe and critical stages of the disease.

The mortality was as high as 20% -40%. Due to the lack of effective antiviral treatments, supporting treatment is the predominant therapy for COVID-19 pneumonia. Its cure is essentially dependent on the patient's immunity. While the immune system eliminates the virus, numerous inflammatory cytokines are produced and a cytokine storm occurs in severe cases.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) play an important role in injury repair and immune regulation, showing advantageous prospects in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. MSCs prevent cytokine storms by retarding the TNF-α pathway, alleviate sepsis by modulating macrophages, neutrophils, NK cells, DC cells, T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes.

The intent is to determine if it is possible to physically improve the ability of the lungs to take up oxygen by applying external pressure to the chest. It is hypothesized that the use of the vest for this patient population will alter the blood flow through the lungs and thereby improve oxygen levels in the body. Participants will wear the ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) vest for 2 hours and study activities will last up to 4 hours.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nIn acute severe respiratory failure due to COVID-19, current recommendations by international Critical Care Societies include placing patients who are dependent on mechanical ventilator support for their survival, on their bellies. This acts to physically redistribute blood to uninjured or minimally injured lung that can still participate in taking up oxygen. Unfortunately, not all centers are equipped or trained for this maneuver which has it's own inherent risks. The investigators are proposing that the effects of proning can be safely mimicked by the V/Q vest by applying pressure through a non invasive externally fitted vest. By 4 front and rear inflatable compartments, doctors can fine tune the redirection of blood as occurs in proning. However the vest successfully avoids the need for expensive specialized equipment, training and facilities. In addition, preliminary assessment of the technique using sand bags to apply pressure, the investigators found that those patients who did not respond to this maneuver also failed to respond to more costly therapies. The vest potentially acts as a therapy in and of itself and as an indicator of what is optimal treatment for the COVID-19 patient while saving hospital resources and economic burden.\n\nThe study procedures will take less than 4 hours to complete for each subject enrolled. During this time, the subject will be sedated. The ventilation perfusion vest consists of two parts for ease of placement. The vest has multiple chambers which will be inflated to different pressures. The vest will be inflated for 1 hour at a specific pressure and the pressure will then be increased for another hour for the purpose of the study.

This study will introduce surfactant to the patients lungs via the COVSurf Drug Delivery System\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nThe hypothesis behind the proposed trial of surfactant therapy for COVID-19 infected patients requiring ventilator support is that endogenous surfactant is dysfunctional. This could be due to decreased concentration of surfactant phospholipid and protein, altered surfactant phospholipid composition, surfactant protein proteolysis and/or oedema protein inhibition of surfactant surface tension function and/or oxidative inactivation of surfactant proteins. Variations of these dysfunctional mechanisms have been reported in a range of lung diseases, including cystic fibrosis and severe asthma, and in child and adult patients with ARDS. Our studies of surfactant metabolism in adult ARDS patients showed altered percentage composition of surfactant PC, with decreased DPPC and increased surface tension-inactive unsaturated species, and decreased concentrations of both total PC and phosphatidylglycerol (PG)\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor, which is preferentially expressed in the peripheral lung ATII cells. Consequent viral infection of ATII cells could reduce cell number and impair the capacity of the lungs to synthesise and secrete surfactant.

First instance treatment includes oxygenotherapy up to 15L/min in spontaneous ventilation. However COVID infection can ultimately lead to an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU). Guidelines on ARDS management are based on small ventilation volume (6 mL/kg), a pulmonary end expiratory pressure (PEEP) chosen to get the best pulmonary compliance, a plateau pressure lower than 30 cm of water and daily prone positioning when PaO2/FiO2 ratio is lower than 150. In ventilated ARDS patients, prone positioning has shown survival improvement. Though they applied this optimized management of ARDS patients, Chinese intensivists have recently reported mortality rate higher than 50% in ARDS COVID patients requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Before being intubated and admitted to ICU, COVID patients require increasing rate of oxygen delivery.

In these patients, the lungs become severely inflamed because of the virus. The inflammation causes fluid from nearby blood vessels to leak into the tiny air sacs in the lungs, making breathing increasingly difficult. This fluid forms small clots in the air sacs, creating a barrier until the cells regenerate.\n\nIn some patients, this clot does not disappear in a timely fashion or interferes with the development of the new cells. Furthermore, the small clots in the air sacs obstruct the air and oxygen getting deep into the lungs, interfering with proper ventilation. The trial will recruit patients with COVID-19 induced ARDS. Eligible patients (or if patients lack capacity, their legal representative) will be provided with an information sheet and informed consent will be sought. Eligibility will be mainly assessed via routine clinical assessments. Patients will receive a nebulised version of a type of drug called tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) that is inhaled using a nebuliser. This is normally a drug used to break down blood clots. In this situation though, it might be useful for stopping clots forming in the lungs, because these might lead to even more difficulties with breathing.\n\nThe first 12 consented patients will receive nebulised rt-PA in addition to standard of care (SOC). The second group of 12 patients will receive SOC alone as a comparison. To evaluate efficacy, the improvement of oxygen levels over time and safety will be be monitored throughout. Blood samples will be taken to measure markers of clotting and inflammation in both groups.\n\nFrom the end of the treatment phase (after Day 3) both groups will be followed up in accordance with SOC.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nThis is a phase II, open label, single centre, uncontrolled, repeated dose, pilot trial of nebulised rt-PA in patients with COVID-19 ARDS.\n\nThe study will recruit patients requiring either IMV or NIV. Eligible patients (or if patients lack capacity, their legal representative) will be provided with an information sheet and informed consent will be sought. Eligibility will be assessed via routine clinical assessments, which may have been done prior to consent. The only exceptions are a pregnancy test (blood or urine), and possibly any assessments that were not done as per routine care. These must be done following consent, and all screening assessments must have been done during the 24-hour period before dosing with rt-PA.\n\nThe first 12 consented patients will receive nebulised rt-PA in addition to SOC. The second group of 12 patients will receive SOC alone as observational arm, to ensure that any changes are not entirely due to disease resolution. Within each group 6 patients will be receiving IMV and another six will be receiving NIV.\n\nA statistically powered randomised controlled trial (RCT) would be ideal to define the magnitude of benefit and impact on overall survival and is the typical design in patients with ARDS. Although there is clinical data on the safety of nebulised rt-PA, but there is no clinical data in this clinical condition to facilitate a sample size calculation. There is data from a small RCT that has used another fibrinolytic agent, but the doses are not comparable. When a patient is randomised to receive no treatment, this precludes participation in other interventional studies which might decrease the risk of mortality. The most recent figures suggest a 50% mortality in patients receiving IMV there is 50% mortality. Currently there is a concerted effort to introduce multiple therapies based on our understanding of the pathophysiologic basis of disorder. Further, if this pilot study shows significant effect in a subset of patients, there would be justification to progress to a statistically powered RCT. In the event of major adverse drug reactions or minor improvement in the oxygenation as assessed by PaO2/FiO2 , there are minimal gains to be had with a larger randomised control study.\n\nFor patients in the rt-PA group, 10 mg of rt-PA dissolved in 5 ml of diluent will be given every 6 hrs for 66 hrs. Dose modifications will not be permitted. Efficacy will be assessed by the monitoring of arterial oxygen saturation.\n\nSafety monitoring will be performed by assessment of the incidence and severity of bleeding events, and by the monitoring of plasma fibrinogen levels and routine coagulation parameters. Additional samples will be taken for exploratory assessment of potential biomarkers, including (but not restricted to) PAI- 1, alpha 2 antiplasmin and a range of inflammatory cytokines and coagulation proteins. All other monitoring will be done as per SOC.\n\nFrom the end of the treatment phase (after Day 3) both groups will be followed up in accordance with SOC.\n\nAlthough there is extensive experience with the use of nebulised rt-PA in the context of the underlying inflammation, safety measures been included. A gap of 24hrs will be maintained between first and second patient. At 24hrs if patient 1 has no evidence of major pulmonary bleeding suggesting exaggerated alveolar fibrinolysis and no evidence of fibrinogen reduction of more than 50%, suggestive of systemic absorption a second patient will be dosed. Both patients will be evaluated for 72 hrs for major pulmonary bleeding and if no bleeding is noticed than the rest of the cohort can be recruited after the review of the safety data by the trial management group comprised of the investigators. If there are any concerns with the data this will be referred to the DMC for review. If the safety profile is acceptable, dosing of the third and subsequent patients in the rt-PA group will resume with no required interval between patients.\n\nEfficacy will be described as a relative improvement in PaO2/FiO2 (or SaO2/FiO2) ratio assessed at day 5 and day 7 after start of treatment.\n\nA Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be set-up to review safety data within the trial along with the final study results and advise on progressing from a pilot study to a randomised control trial based on the safety and efficacy data that is collected. The DMC will receive weekly reports on bleeding complications, both major and minor along with fibrinogen levels. If at any time a patient has major pulmonary bleeding, further dosing of patients will be stopped and an adhoc DMC review will be arranged before resuming dosing (see section 12.2 Data Monitoring Committee).","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04356833","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Such treatment eliminates important endogenous and exogenous inducers of the systemic inflammatory response (PAMPs and DAMPs), proinflammatory mediators (cytokines and ROS), and other biologically active substances (nitric oxide, prostaglandins, and bradykinin) that are involved in the pathogenesis of organ failure [8]. Several case reports also suggest that PE is an effective rescue therapy in critically ill patients with influenza A (H1N1) [9-11].

Former research in the lab of the investigators has shown positive effects of an interactive attention control/interpretation training, in which participants learned to unscramble scrambled sentences (\"life is my a party mess\") in a positive way (\"my life is a party\") by getting eye-tracking feedback about attention for positive (\"party\") vs. negative information (\"mess\"). After the training, participants could better reinterpret negative photos in a positive way. Attention- and cognitive control mechanisms prior to negative stressors (proactive control) and after negative stressors (reactive control) seem to play a role in this. Moreover, research has shown that low perceived control and negative expectations about future emotion regulation skills results in lower proactive control and a higher need of reactive control. Based on this, the assumption can be made that the effects of attention control training - targeting reactive control - could benefit from adding techniques that affect proactive control (e.g. psycho-education). In the present study this is investigated by testing a new two weeks attention control training to see if this has a positive effect on stress related complaints, depressive symptoms and emotion regulation. Given that the current COVID-19 pandemic is perceived as very stressful by a lot of people, the training could help here. Participants between 18 to 65 years of age are recruited during this corona crisis. The attention control training is a new smartphone based application. Participants have to unscramble scrambled sentences into grammatically correct sentences. In the training condition, participants are asked to unscramble the scrambled sentences in a positive way. By swiping, participants can see part of the sentences. This gives the investigators an image about the processing of the sentences. This procedure allows to measure how long participants attend to positive and negative words. In the training condition participants get feedback about the duration they process positive and negative words. In the control group participants unscramble the sentences as fast as possible without feedback on emotional attention. Participants only get feedback about the speed at which sentences are unscrambled. Before and after the 10 training sessions, attention of the participants is measured to see the effects of the training. Questionnaires on depressive and anxiety complaints, emotion regulation strategies, well-being and stress are administered before and after the training. There is also a follow-up measure 2 months after the training. Both groups (training and control) watch a psycho-education video before the start of the training.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04367636","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

The investigators serve as the regional plastic, burns and reconstructive centre for the West of Scotland, population 3 million. All face to face clinics have been cancelled and converted to telephone/telemedicine only consultations. The investigators will establish both 2D and 3D telemedicine as normal patient follow up practice during this period.\n\nThe aim is to implement a 3D telemedicine system to facilitate patient follow up and remote physiotherapy, that will act as if the patient is physically 'present' in the room. Physiotherapy is crucial to patient outcomes after burns contractures, hand trauma and cancer reconstruction. The 3D telemedicine system will be built by an industrial partner, with CE marked equipment, specifically to help during the Covid-19 Pandemic.\n\nThis study forms a follow on study to the investigator's pilot study (based on clinical feedback only)\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nDuring Covid pandemic the Canniesburn Plastic Surgery Unit has stopped face to face clinics. The investigators therefore aim to assess current telemedicine options from a clinician viewpoint.\n\nWhy is the 3D telemedicine study important during Covid 19?\n\nAugment not replace current telemedicine capabilities. 3D telemedicine system would be transformative - much of Plastic Surgery work is 3 dimensional e.g. burns contractures, cleft lip. A 3D system may therefore give clinicians a more 'realistic' and accurate representation of patient interaction.\nReduce viral load in clinic. This will reduce face to face contact. High viral load transmission (eg in the confines of an all day clinic) may be associated with higher risk of healthcare worker mortality.\nFacilitate remote therapies and improve patient outcomes. Current 2D telemedicine (e.g. Attend Anywhere) is limited in the ability to remotely guide patient therapies - the therapist cannot guide the camera or look at specific areas of interest. With 3D telemedicine the therapist can 'walk around' the patient as if the patient were co-present, and look at areas of interest with ease.\nMeasurements of angles/other clinical measurements. For example, after a burns contracture or hand trauma a clinician may want to measure the angles at the wrist joint to see if there is any improvement. This cannot be done accurately with 2D telemedicine. 3D telemedicine may facilitate the measurement of angles and assess outcomes but this is unknown.\n\nMethod Randomised Controlled Trial. Single blinded (participants blinded - unaware of type of telemedicine, clinicians unblinded - aware of type of telemedicine)\n\nStudy setting and Participants:\n\nThe study will review clinician's assessments of telemedicine and clinical assessment of patients using telemedicine. These will consist of the plastic surgery patients selected from general plastic surgery clinic including patients with breast reconstruction, sarcoma, limb reconstruction, head & neck reconstruction, flap reconstruction, hand trauma and cleft lip, and will be known to the research team. The assessment is of the telemedicine system by the clinician only. There will be two sites, the 'remote' site where the patient attends, and the 'central' site where the clinician reviews the patient. Remote site will be at West Glasgow Ambulatory Care Hospital (Covid free site) and the central location will be Glasgow Royal Infirmary.\n\nOutcomes The investigators aim to answer the question \"How does 3D telemedicine compare to 2D telemedicine?\"\n\nPrimary outcomes:\n\nMental Effort Rating Scale, University Hospital of North Norway (UNN) scales, Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ)\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\nSubjective feedback with transcribing, coding and thematic analysis.

Up to 120 patients, primary outcome intubation or death within 14 days. All data will be extracted remotely from the EHR.\n\nClinical Implications: The study has potential to establish IL-6R blockade, delivered subcutaneously, as standard of care in reducing progression to critical illness in patients with moderate COVID-19 disease.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nAims/Objectives\n\nThe effectiveness of blockade of IL-6R in treating patients with COVID-19 disease of moderate severity will be tested in a pragmatic and adaptive randomized trial. The primary outcome is intubation or death within 14 days of enrollment. Secondary outcomes include time to hospital discharge if alive, time to clinical recovery as was defined in a recent study [1], ICU length of stay, time to return to normal or baseline oxygen saturation, and changes in laboratory biomarkers.\n\nBackground Information\n\nSARS-COV-2 is a novel human pathogen that emerged at the end of 2019 and rapidly spread worldwide. Clinical disease caused by this novel infection has a high mortality rate, particularly in older adults and in patients with underlying cardiopulmonary disease, populations that are highly prevalent within the VA healthcare system. This creates an urgent need for the VA to quickly and efficiently identify effective therapies to reduce mortality and spread of the disease. Based on in vitro and in vivo data, potential treatment options include anti-viral drugs (such as antimalarials or medications originally developed to treat HIV infection (e.g., lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir)), anti-inflammatory drugs, including IL-6 inhibition, and innovations in supportive care, such as placing patients in prone positioning while awake and not intubated. Importantly, in the context of the global pandemic and exponential spread of the disease, clinical trials must be designed in a manner that 1) optimizes outcomes for Veterans, and 2) produces rapid answers, so that effective treatments can be deployed quickly to reduce unnecessary deaths. Based on a review of 384 ongoing clinical trials by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, and a daily search of open clinical trials, many conventional controlled clinical trials of antiviral drugs and cytokine-blocking drugs are in progress and are likely to be completed within a few months; however, it is possible that these trials, which may take months to implement and report results, will not yield any information about how to treat patients until after the peak of the pandemic is over. A secondary challenge is that it is important to identify what works and what does not work quickly, so that manufacturers can understand what medications need to be produced so that supply chains are adequate for treating all patients who might benefit from an intervention. Thus, innovative clinical trial methodologies are needed in order to produce answers in a highly compressed time frame to inform medical decision-making and supply chain management.\n\nThis novel and innovative proposal concerns use and comparison an existing drug (sarilumab) that blocks the receptor for the inflammatory cytokine IL-6. Most studies of IL-6 pathway blockade are using IV medications and include restrictive eligibility criteria and are directed towards patients with severe disease. We hypothesize that patients earlier in the disease course - prior to severe respiratory decompensation - might benefit the most from IL-6 inhibition, and thus are the population included in this pragmatic trial. This study will expand our knowledge and understanding about how IL-6 inhibition can be used to prevent disease progression in patients with moderate disease. It will use a more readily available subcutaneous, longer-acting formulation directed towards patients with moderate disease, of whom 25-35% can progress to severe disease, often rapidly. Eligibility criteria allow for a broad range of underlying choices of other medications, including antiviral medications such as remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine, among others, baseline laboratory values, and comorbidities, reflecting likely real-world clinical use. Thus, this pragmatic project would fill a major gap in research about the clinical care of patients with COVID-19.\n\nRationale and Purpose\n\nSevere COVID-19 disease is characterized by a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) followed by a severe cardiomyopathy in many cases. Based on currently available data, it is unclear how much of the respiratory damage in COVID-19 is due to direct effects of SARS-COV-2, or if the primary driver of severe disease is the inflammatory response generated in response to the virus. The key role of inflammation in the progression of the disease is highlighted by recent studies, which demonstrate that patients who progress to requiring ICU-level care no longer have detectable virus present in their respiratory tract. Thus, identifying drugs that could dampen the inflammatory response prior to severe clinical decompensation without adversely affecting clearance of virus would be clinically useful and lead to improved outcomes. Elevated biomarkers of severe inflammation (such as IL-6, CRP, ferritin, and lymphopenia) have been strongly associated with severe disease and increased mortality in patients with COVID-19 [2,3], and early development of a strong IgG response may paradoxically be a poor prognostic sign during the acute phase of the disease. In contrast, viral load in upper respiratory secretions at baseline is only modestly associated with clinical outcomes, and viral load declines in most patients after presentation, independent of the clinical course of the disease [4]. Severe disease typically arises more than 2 weeks after symptom onset, a time at which virus is usually no longer detectable. These findings suggest that progression to severe disease may be driven more by the inflammatory response to the disease than a direct viral effect, and point to anti-inflammatory drugs as potentially critical therapeutic options. Importantly, high dose glucocorticoids have been found to be ineffective in severe COVID-19 and are associated with somewhat worse outcomes, so other more targeted anti-inflammatory options are urgently needed.\n\nBlockade of IL-6 signaling is a particularly attractive approach. Sarilumab and tocililzumab are antibodies to the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), FDA-approved for long-term treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Tocilizumab has been used open-label with enough anecdotal success in enough patients in China [5] that the manufacturers of sarilumab and tocilizumab have rapidly opened clinical trials in multiple countries at assess efficacy in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. Tocilizumab has also demonstrated efficacy in reducing mortality associated with the cytokine release syndrome in patients receiving CAR-T treatment for cancer, in which the pathogenic pathway is widespread T-cell activation, which leads to production of pleiotropic inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 by monocytes. Although trials attempting to rescue patients with severe COVID-19 with ARDS and/or cardiomyopathy are essential and are in progress, the ideal population for clinical use may be patients who are not yet critically ill but are at high risk of clinical deterioration due to secondary inflammation.\n\nRelevance to Veterans Health\n\nCOVID-19 has a high mortality rate of 2-3% among symptomatic patients. It is expected to have a particularly high mortality in Veterans, because age >60, underlying cardiovascular or lung disease, and obesity are significant risk factors for mortality and clinical deterioration. Thus, advances in care of patients sick enough to be hospitalized yet prior to ICU admission are expected to have particular benefit for Veterans.\n\nStudy Design\n\nDesign. Prospective, randomized, unblinded interventional clinical trial.\n\nTwo arms: standard care, based on established practices within the medical center, or standard care plus subcutaneous sarilumab.\n\nAssignment Strategy: Randomized play-the-winner design, such that randomization becomes weighted toward the arm that was more effective in previous enrolled subjects. The probability of randomization to a specific arm (standard of care or standard of care plus intervention) will be updated based on outcomes in blocks of 10-20 subjects (see Planned Statistical Analyses). There is an option for open-label use of sarilumab in the standard-care group in the event the primary outcome (intubation) is met. Such patients may also receive any other treatment per the judgment of their treating physician.\n\nData will be extracted remotely from the EHR. No data will be generated specifically for study purposes.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04359901","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

This study will test if the well-being of hospital workers facing a novel coronavirus outbreak is improved by adding either of two interventions: (1) Peer Resilience Champions (PRC): an interdisciplinary team of professionals who actively monitor for early signs of heightened stress within clinical teams, liaise between staff and senior management to improve organizational responsiveness, and provide direct support and teaching (under the supervision of experts in resilience, infection control, and professional education). Investigators will test the effectiveness of this PRC Intervention by rolling it out to different parts of the hospital in stages and comparing levels of burnout before and after the intervention reaches particular teams and units (a stepped wedge design). By the end of the study, PRC Support will have been provided to all clinical and research staff and many learners (> 6,000 people). Note that the provision of PRC support will be directed to the entire organization. The research portion of the study is the evaluation of PRC support through a repeated survey completed by consenting staff. Investigators will test the effectiveness of the PRC by measuring trends in burnout and other effects of stress over the course of the study in a subgroup of hospital workers (as many as consent, target ~1000 people) through an online questionnaire (called \"How Are You?\"). (2) The second intervention is an enriched version of the \"How Are You?\" Survey, which provides personalized feedback about coping, interpersonal interactions and moral distress. Participants will be randomized (1:1) to receive the shorter Express Survey (identifying data and outcome measures only), or the Enriched survey (all of the Express measures plus additional measures with feedback based on responses). It is hypothesized that both the PRC intervention and the Enriched Survey intervention will help prevent or reduce instances of burnout in HCWs.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nThis project studies the impact of two interventions, the addition of Peer Resilience Champions to other hospital supports and an interactive computer-based learning intervention that provides personalized feedback about relevant interpersonal and psychological characteristics of participants.\n\nThe Peer Resilience Champion (PRC) Intervention Investigators will second or hire an interdisciplinary team of healthcare professionals (e.g. nurses, social worker, or infection control professional, total of 1 FTE) to serve as Peer Resilience Champions. These Champions will receive coaching and then ongoing supervision in the relevant aspects of stress management, peer support, and resource navigation by expert members of the research team based on existing evidence. Peer Resilience Champions will act predominantly at the level of clinical units and departments.\n\nThe activities of Peer Resilience Champions will, in part, be modelled on the role that psychiatrists acting as support coaches have played in during the acute phase of the pandemic. These include support, identification of needs, education, advocacy and resource navigation. In doing so, the Champions follow evidence-based principles and guidelines. The model is to provide quickly responsive, adaptive, peer support because it is expected that the needs of staff will change over the course of a pandemic and in its aftermath.\n\nPeer Resilience Champions will work in an expanding selection of hospital locations, following a randomized cluster (stepped wedge) design until the resource is available to the entire organization. People who work and learn at Sinai Health do not need to participate in this study in order to receive the potential benefits provided by Peer Resilience Champions, which will be provided irrespective of study participation. The effectiveness of Peer Resilience Champions in reducing burnout and other outcomes will be tested using outcome measures included in the feedback staff survey (see below), which is completed by consenting participants in this study.\n\nInteractive Computer-based Learning Intervention A staff survey which includes all primary and secondary outcomes measures will be completed by consenting participants at intervals of approximately 3 months seven times (over approximately 21 months). Participating staff will be randomized 1:1 to receive only these measures with no feedback (the Express Survey) or these measures plus additional measures of interpersonal and psychological characteristics, with personalized feedback (the Enriched Survey). Feedback is based on previous experience from the investigators in providing feedback from validated measures completed online to both healthcare workers and the general public. The purpose of feedback is to encourage self-reflection, especially with respect to coping and interpersonal interactions. The core measures that are common to both the Express and Enriched surveys serve to tests the effectiveness of the Peer Resilience Champions Intervention. The effectiveness of the Interactive Computer-based learning intervention will be tested by comparing the core measures between those receiving the Express Survey and those receiving the Enriched Survey.\n\nPeer Resilience Champion Support The study design provides a controlled comparison of support as usual to PRC support. Using a randomized cluster (stepped wedged) design, usual staff support will be compared to that of PRC. PRC operates largely at the level of the clinical units and groups, and so a randomized cluster design is preferable to a randomized controlled trial. The stepped wedge design allows clusters of hospital staff/volunteers to receive the PRC intervention in a random sequence until the resource is available to all areas of the hospital.\n\nThis intervention will take place at Sinai Health System, including the Mount Sinai (approximately 4500 employees), Bridgepoint (approximately 1200 staff), and Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute (LTRI) (approximately 1200 staff).\n\nFive clusters of clinical units and departments will be constructed that are approximately balanced between hospital units and staff groups with (i) high COVID patient acuity (ICU, Emergency, medical units with negative pressure rooms) or high exposure to patients from community with unknown COVID status (Family Medicine, Labour and Delivery), (ii) all other clinical patient care areas, (iii) non-patient care areas, and (iv) areas in which most or all staff are/were temporarily restricted from attending the hospital (e.g. LTRI, volunteers).\n\nAfter survey participants (and their disciplines and clinical units) are identified (T0 survey), their corresponding units, will be grouped into one of the five clusters in order to meet the above goals. These clusters will then be randomized in order to determine the order of intervention implementation. Each cluster will either receive support as usual or PRC for a period of three months, followed by the completion of a survey questionnaire given at seven different time points (T1-T7) spaced by three months.\n\nNOTE - justification for choosing a non-blind comparison: Since the Express Survey is shorter than the Enriched Survey, participants are not blind to survey cohort assignment. Nor does the design control for time spent on an online activity. It would be possible to control for the duration of the survey by expanding the length of the control condition and this would also allow for the possibility of a blind comparison. However, a longer control survey would increase the risk of drop-out among participants in the control condition because completing surveys without interaction or feedback is not interesting. Since maximizing continued participation in serial surveys is critical to testing the PRC intervention hypothesis, a non-blind test of the Enriched Survey intervention hypothesis is preferable to increasing the risk of being underpowered to test the PRC hypothesis.\n\nFeedback Surveys Immediately after consenting, participants will be asked to complete the T0 survey that asks about identifying information, and the characteristics of the participant's work at Sinai Health. The T0 survey also collects an email address, to which all subsequent surveys (T1 to T7) are sent. Following receipt of the T0 survey, participants are randomized to receive either the Express Survey (T1 to T7) or the Enriched survey (T1 to T7). In either case, T1 is sent soon (~1-2 weeks) after T0. All subsequent surveys are sent at approximately 3-month intervals.\n\nT0 survey - The initial survey collects identifying data (non-binary gender, discipline, department, age, marital status), years of experience, SARS experience, number of people in household and information about COVID-19 experience to date (exposure to patients, experience with isolation of self or family members, testing etc.). Two free optional text write-in questions provide allow participants to describe more about themselves or their experience (past experience surveying healthcare workers post-SARS was that many were keen to write at length about their experience, beyond data collected more formally, and that insights from this open-ended reporting were valuable for placing quantitative results in experiential context during analysis and knowledge dissemination phases). The T0 survey takes about 10 minutes to complete plus whatever time is spent providing optional free-text answers.\n\nExpress Survey: The express survey includes validated measures of the primary outcome, the emotional exhaustion scale of the Maslach Burnout Inventory. The Express Survey also includes measures of secondary outcomes: sleep, post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, psychological distress, occupational resilience, and COVID-19 prevention and control self-efficacy (using an instrument revised from a measure of self-efficacy used in preparation for an expected pandemic. The survey is the same each time it is completed (T1 to T7) at 3-month intervals. The Express Survey takes about 10 minutes to complete.\n\nEnriched Survey: The Enriched Survey contains all of the measures included in the Express survey. No feedback is provided from any of these measures (i.e. this portion of the Enriched survey is identical to the Express Survey). In addition to these core outcome measures, the Enriched Survey includes measures of personality, interpersonal style and coping and provides personalized feedback based on scores at time points T1 to T6. The interactive measures included vary from one survey time point to the next in order to provide variety, and to cover a larger number of participant characteristics within the limits of reasonable survey time burden. State-dependent characteristics which may change over time (coping, interpersonal problems) are measured twice. A measure of lifetime experience with moral distress and a measurement of attachment, a stable trait, occur only once. The Enriched T1 to T6 surveys take about 10-20 minutes.\n\nSample size This study is powered to test hypothesis 1, which is expected to require a larger sample size than testing hypothesis 2. There are over 6000 staff at Sinai Health. Assuming a starting proportion of 30.4% of staff with high burnout (based on previous studies), an 80% power, and an alpha level of 0.05, five clusters of 200 staff providing measures per cluster is sufficient to detect a drop of ≥ 9.4% (with an intracluster correlation coefficient [ICC] of 0.01), ≥10.7% (ICC of 0.015), or ≥ 11.9% (ICC of 0.2). These ICC estimates are congruent with previous studies. These differences are consistent with a post-SARS study that found high burnout in 30.4% of exposed and 19.2% of unexposed HCWs. Five clusters of 200 staff (n=1000) would require <17% of staff to consent to participate and complete the measures.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04373382","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Additionally, in the event many people become critically ill at once, COVID-19 has the possibility of overwhelming hospitals to the point where they have to make decisions about how to determine who receives intensive care and life-support measures. Many hospitals as well as local or state governments have been working on policies to determine how to make these decisions. This study seeks to learn about how COVID-19 has affected the way patients and healthcare providers care for themselves and about their thoughts and concerns about policies that may \"ration\" life-support resources.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nBackground: COVID-19 has led to significant disruptions to usual operations of the health care system and routines of millions of people. Regular medical appointments have been preempted or converted to telemedicine, dietary changes have occurred due to food supply chain strain, and exercise regimens altered by physical distancing policies, all of which may affect preventive care and chronic illness management [1]. Additionally, anxiety about risk of developing COVID-19 and the availability of health care resources may alter care-seeking behaviors even for serious conditions, e.g., heart attacks [2]. Understanding personal health and protective behaviors under threat of COVID-19 is an epidemiologic imperative and can inform immediate public health response as well as planning for population health needs post-crisis.\n\nCritical care capacity during COVID-19 is also a matter of extreme concern [3]. Limitations in capacity, particularly mechanical ventilators [4, 5] have necessitated scarce resource allocation (SRA) policies, which outline triage protocols while observing ethical principles of distributive justice, transparency, and equitability [4, 6]. In practice, these policies determine which patients are most likely to benefit from intensive care, and some patients with a significantly heightened risk for mortality [7-9] are less likely to be prioritized in critical care allocation decisions. The uncertainty around prioritization and threat of rationing of care has generated public attention and anxiety evident in medical journals [6, 10], news outlets [11], and on social media [12, 13].\n\nThe rapidity of this crisis has compelled rapid development and/or modification of SRA policies without the rigorous stakeholder engagement or evaluations of acceptance of these policies by both laypersons and practitioners tasked with implementing such policies [14-16]. Two states (CA & NY), among the most affected by COVID-19, have recently developed new SRA policies, creating a unique opportunity to evaluate how these policies are understood and perceived by the patients most likely to be impacted by them and the practitioners who will implement them. Moreover, given the complexity of the ethical underpinnings and potential misinformation about SRA policies, there is a clear need to determine if a brief educational intervention can influence perception and knowledge about these containment and management policies.\n\nWe propose to undertake rapid recruitment of a national cohort of individuals and health care workers to understand knowledge and perceptions of public health and clinical efforts during this evolving pandemic; and to implement a randomized controlled trial within this cohort to test the ability of a brief intervention to improve knowledge and perceptions about the health care system's capacity to provide equitable care during a pandemic. Our specific aims are to:\n\nAim 1: Determine how key indicators of population health (including health status, health behaviors, and access to care) have changed during the COVID-19 outbreak in the US.\nAim 1a: Uncover the extent of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in the impacts of COVID-19 on health, health behaviors, and access to care.\nAim 2: Assess the public's and practitioners' knowledge and values around SRA policies and examine which individual characteristics correlate with these knowledge and values.\nAim 3: Evaluate the impact of a brief educational intervention on knowledge and values for SRA policy among the public and health care workers.\n\nPopulation & Recruitment: For Aim 1, we will employ national outreach strategies [17-19] via social media and partnerships with national organizations (e.g., TCOYD) to recruit a sample of adults (ages 18 and older) from the general population. We will enrich this sample by direct recruitment efforts (via online health portal invitation) of over 300,000 patients in the Southern California Area who are cared for in the University of California at Los Angeles Health System (UCLA Health). For Aim 2, we will employ similar national outreach strategies involving professional language targeted posts on social media sites (e.g., Doximity, LinkedIn) to recruit a sample of health care providers. Additionally, this cohort will be enriched by direct recruitment efforts of health workers employed by UCLA. Cohort participants in Aims 1 & 2 from California and New York (residence determined based on ZIP code) will be randomized for Aim 3 to receive either a brief educational video or no intervention. All participants (Aims 1-3) will be invited to complete three surveys (baseline, one-month post-intervention follow-up, and four-month follow-up; Figure 1). Sample recruitment path and representativeness with be assessed using unique source links and standard visitor tracking analytics built into the study website.\n\nSurvey Assessments: Participants will first be presented with an online consent form that includes language typical of a written consent and upon affirming consent will be directed to complete the baseline survey. The patient baseline survey will collect sociodemographic information (including ZIP code), chronic conditions and current health status, health behaviors, anxiety and stress levels, changes to health and care seeking behaviors (e.g., social distancing, medication adherence, care-seeking behaviors), and will include series of questions assessing perceptions and attitudes and knowledge about SRA policies and how they are implemented (e.g., values about how decisions are made, understanding of prioritization versus exclusion from critical care). Demographic, behavioral, and access questions are largely derived from the validated Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System questionnaires [20] which will provide a historical comparison for study results. For providers, additional questions about the characteristics of the provider will include specialty, years of practice, and trainee status. Follow-up surveys will re-administer key baseline questions on SRA knowledge and values, personal health behaviors, and COVID-19-specific impacts (e.g., if they or a loved one was hospitalized and/or was subject to an SRA policy decision, and for providers, whether they had to use an SRA tool during their practice); follow-up surveys will additional ascertain exposure to media coverage about COVID-19 and SRAs in the intervening windows. All surveys will be administered via Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system and links to complete follow-up surveys will be automatically delivered to participants via e-mail, with up to four reminders to complete, facilitating linkage between survey administration within individuals. E-mails will be stored separately from survey data in REDCap and will be permanently deleted upon study completion.\n\nIntervention and Randomization: We will develop a brief (~3 min) video intervention that describes what SRA policies are, how they were developed, who is most likely to be impacted, and patients' rights under these policies. Two versions will be utilized, one oriented for a lay audience and one for practitioners using technical medical language, but both will be relevant to the policies currently in place in two of the hardest hit states (NY and CA). The investigators have contracted with WorldWise Productions, who have completed similar videos for multiple other UCLA Health and DGSOM projects. The intervention will be hosted on a private YouTube channel and embedded in REDCap so that it can be automatically delivered as part of the survey. We will execute a stratified randomization scheme based on state, age, and education level to allocate respondents from CA and NY evenly between intervention and control. Participants outside CA & NY will serve as negative controls. All participants will receive a post-intervention survey with repeat assessment (as described above).\n\nFocus Groups: Because COVID-19 is a rapidly evolving crisis and there are no pre-existing validated questions to ascertain COVID-19 perceptions and impacts, we plan to conduct a final qualitative follow-up (post-crisis) with a geographically and sociodemographically diverse selection of participants (both patients and providers) in order to obtain a more nuanced and complete examination of perceptions, attitudes, and experiences. Participants selected will be invited to participate approximately 4-6 months later (after the COVID-19 crisis has slowed). Key health behavior themes will include experience with telemedicine, disruptions to health care access, and general changes to health during and after COVID-19 pandemic; particular attention will be paid to inequities in these outcomes. Key SRA themes will include the method of selecting patients, concerns about equity, special considerations for disadvantaged or vulnerable populations, and perceptions of the crisis response in general. Groups will be conducted via web-conference using Zoom and recorded, transcribed, and then qualitative methods used to analyze transcripts for key themes. We plan to conduct approximately 15 focus groups of 5-10 participants each.\n\nPower: To detect a ½ standard deviation change in the number of correct knowledge items between the intervention and control arms with 90% power and a two-sided α=0.05, 172 total participants are needed to complete follow-up. Based on our prior work [18, 19] with >80% trial retention and recruitment of 55 participants per day, we anticipate recruiting the necessary 216 baseline trial participants within 4 days. We anticipate that we will substantially exceed our targets to achieve desired trial power.\n\nMilestones & Actionable Outcomes: There is a paucity of evidence on changes in health status and behaviors related to physical distancing policies and the widescale adoption and implementation of SRA policies. By determining how health behaviors and access to care are impacted at baseline, we can directly issue recommendations for patients and providers aimed at affecting population health and mitigating disparities therein. Our assessment of SRA policies and how they are perceived and implemented during a crisis will dramatically increase our ability to design and apply such policies in a fair and equitable way and to determine what adjustments to the policies from a clinical perspective are needed to ensure that disproportionate burden is not borne by vulnerable patients. As the baseline survey has already been developed, piloted, and programmed into REDCap and we have established partnerships with several organizations who have already agreed to assist with study recruitment - we are prepared to initiate the study immediately. Production on the intervention video can begin as soon as notice of funds have been received. Trial milestones include recruitment of >216 participants from CA & NY within the first week of recruitment and retention of >172 participants at one-month follow-up. Additional milestones include the submission of several research papers to high-impact medical journals detailing research findings.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04373135","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Mortality rates as high as 80% have been reported among those who develop ARDS, despite intensive care and mechanical ventilation.\n\nPatients with COVID-19 induced non-Acute Lung Injury who have demonstrated reduction in blood oxygenation, dyspnea, and exercise intolerance but do not require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation will be treated with Aviptadil, a synthetic version of Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP) plus Standard of Care vs. placebo + Standard of Care. Patients will be randomized to intravenous Aviptadil will receive inhaled Aviptadil, 100 μg 3x daily vs. placebo 3x daily. The primary outcome will be progression to ARDS over 28 days. Secondary outcomes will include blood oxygenation as measured by pulse oximetry, dyspnea, exercise tolerance, and levels of TNFα IL-6 and other cytokines.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nDetailed Description:\n\nAcute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a known lethal complication of Corona Virus (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Conventional medical therapy, including intensive care and respiratory support is associated with an 80% mortality.\n\nThe objective of this study is to identify patients with non-Acute Lung Injury (NALI) in COVID-19 and treat them with inhaled Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP) in the hope of preventing progression from NALI to Acute Lung Injury and ARDS. Aviptadil, a synthetic form of Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP) has been awarded FDA Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of ARDS.\n\nNonclinical studies demonstrate that VIP is highly concentrated in the lung, where it prevents NMDA-induced caspase-3 activation in the lung, inhibits IL6 and TNFa production, protects against HCl-induced pulmonary edema, These and other effects have been observed in numerous animal model systems of lung injury in mice, rats, guinea pigs, sheep, swine, and dogs. In these models, Aviptadil restores barrier function at the endothelial/alveolar interface and thereby protects the lung and other organs from failure.\n\nAviptadil is approved for human use in Europe and has a demonstrated 20 year history of safety in numerous trials for Sarcoid, Pulmonary Fibrosis, Bronchospasm, Erectile Dysfunction, and a phase I trial in ARDS. In that phase I trial, 8 patients with severe ARDS on mechanical ventilation were treated with ascending doses of VIP. Seven of the 8 patients were successfully extubated and were alive at the five day timepoint.

The virus was first isolated from patients presented with pneumonia in Wuhan in December 2019. Sequences of the Wuhan betacoronavirus show similarities to betacoronaviruses found in bats, sharing a common ancestor with the 2003 SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the bat coronavirus HKU9, a virus found in fruit bats. Similar to SARS-CoV, it is a member of Beta-CoV lineage B. Five genomes of the novel coronavirus have been initially isolated and reported including BetaCoV/Wuhan/IVDC-HB-01/2019, BetaCoV/Wuhan/IVDC-HB-04/2020, BetaCoV/Wuhan/IVDC-HB-05/2019, BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/2019, and BetaCoV/Wuhan/IPBCAMS-WH-01/2019 from the China CDC.\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 has since spread from China to the rest of the world. As of 5 April 2020, more than 1.05 million people been confirmed to have infected by SARS-CoV-2, resulting in more than 500,000 deaths. No specific antiviral treatment for the SARS-CoV-2 is currently available, but existing medication could be repurposed.\n\nGenetic sequencing demonstrated similarity of the SARS-CoV-2 to the SARS-CoV and MERS CoV.2 We expect patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 will also present similarly with initial upper respiratory tract symptoms including fever, cough, sputum, myalgia and shortness or breath. More severe cases might complicate with pneumonia and required ventilatory or ECMO support. According to our previous studies in 2003 on patients hospitalized for severe SARS-CoV, the viral load peaked between day 7 from symptoms onset and coincided with clinical deterioration of pneumonia and respiratory failure, with majority of the patients required intensive care support. Higher viral load isolated from different human system also correlated with worsened SARS manifestation and complications.\n\nPreviously, we have demonstrated that interferon-beta 1b, commonly used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis and lopinavir/ ritonavir, also demonstrated to improve the outcome of MERS-CoV infection in a non-human primate model of common marmoset.\n\nA non-randomized trial has also suggested that a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin might be effective in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 viral load in patients, despite in-vitro activity was only found in hydroxychloroquine.\n\nTherefore, we propose to conduct an open-label randomized controlled trial on a short course of interferon β-1b and hydroxychloroquine combination treatment for patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nThis is a prospective open-label randomised controlled trial among adult patients hospitalised after April 2020 for virologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nPatients will be randomly assigned to either the treatment group: a 3-day course of 3 doses of subcutaneous injection of interferon β-1b 1mL (0.25mg; 8 million IU) consecutively on day 1 to day 3 and hydroxychloroquine 800mg on day 1, then 400mg daily for 2 days plus standard care, or the control group: a 3-day course of hydroxycholoroquine 800mg on day 1, then 400mg daily for 2 days plus standard care alone (1:1).\n\nFor the control group, if the day 4 nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) viral load remains positive, then patients will receive another 3 days of subcutaneous injection of interferon β-1b 1mL (0.25mg; 8 million IU) and hydroxychloroquine 400mg daily.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04350281","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Recently, there has been an increase in cases of hyposmia without associated nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea. Although we do not yet know the long-term consequences of COVID-19 on olfaction, there is evidence in the literature demonstrating that post-viral hyposmias are an important source of long-term olfactory disorders, impacting quality of life.\n\nUsually, the treatment of viral hyposmias is based on local and/or general corticosteroid treatment combined with saline nasal irrigation at the onset of signs. Because of the possible development of severe forms of the SARS-Cov-2 infection, the French Society of Otorhinolaryngology has advised against treatment by corticosteroid therapy and nasal irrigation. However, as the virus is present in the nasal fossae on average for 20 days, persistent hyposmia at 30 days would probably result from an inflammatory or neurological damage to the nasal slits or olfactory bulb. Local treatment with corticosteroids could then be instituted from 30 days after the onset of symptoms of COVID-19 without risk of dissemination.\n\nIn persistent hyposmia other than chronic rhinosinusitis, the only treatment that has proven its efficacy is nasal irrigation associated with budesonide and olfactory rehabilitation. However, this drug does not have marketing authorisation in France for this indication.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nThis is a multicenter randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy of local budesonide (nasal irrigation) in the management of persistent hyposmia in COVID-19 patients.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04361474","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

A Randomized Controlled Multi-center Trial","abstract":"Brief summary:\nBackground: The COVID-19 pandemic challenges the available hospital capacity, and this will be augmented by absenteeism of healthcare workers (HCW). HCW are at high risk, currently HCW constitute 20% of all the COVID-19 cases in Denmark. Strategies to prevent absenteeism of HCW are urgently needed.\n\nBacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is a vaccine against tuberculosis, with protective non-specific effects against other infections; significant reductions in morbidity and mortality have been reported, and a plausible immunological mechanism has been identified.\n\nWe hypothesize that BCG vaccination can reduce HCW absenteeism during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPrimary objective: To reduce absenteeism among HCW with direct patient contacts during the COVID-19 epidemic. Secondary objective: To reduce the number of HCW that are infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 epidemic and to reduce the number of hospital admissions amongst HCW with direct patient contacts during the COVID-19 epidemic.\n\nStudy design: A multi-center randomized placebo controlled trial. Study population: 1500 HCW with direct patient contacts; defined as nurses, physicians and other medical staff working at emergency rooms and wards where COVID-infected patients are treated.\n\nIntervention: Participants will be randomized 1:1 to intradermal administration of a standard dose of BCG vaccine or placebo (saline).\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints: Primary endpoint: Number of days of (unplanned) absenteeism for any reason. Secondary endpoints: Number of days of (unplanned) absenteeism because of documented COVID infection. Cumulative incidence of hospital admissions.\n\nRisk for participants and impact: Based on previous experience and randomized controlled trials in adult and elderly individuals, the risks of BCG vaccination are considered low. The objective of this trial is to evaluate the potential beneficial effects of BCG vaccination through a lower work absenteeism rate of HCW and/or a mitigated clinical course of COVID infection.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nBACKGROUND Health-care workers face an elevated risk of exposure to - and infection with - SARS-CoV-2. It is imperative to ensure the safety, health and fitness of hospital personnel in order to safeguard continuous patient care. Strategies to prevent COVID-19 or to mitigate its clinical consequences are urgently needed.\n\nBacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) was developed as a vaccine against tuberculosis, but our group has shown that it can protect against death from other infections, it has what we have called non-specific effects (NSEs).[3] In clinical studies, BCG vaccination was associated with less child mortality, mainly as a result of reduced neonatal sepsis and respiratory infections. In a WHO-commissioned meta-analysis, BCG was associated with 42% (95%CI: 24-55%) lower child mortality.\n\nNSEs of BCG are not limited to children. An Indonesian trial has shown that consecutive BCG vaccination for 3 months reduced the incidence of acute upper tract respiratory infections by 80% (95%CI=22-95%).\n\nIt has been recently demonstrated that the non-specific beneficial effects of BCG vaccination are due to epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming of innate immune cells, a process termed 'trained immunity'. E.g. among humans receiving yellow fever vaccine virus, those who had received BCG had - compared to placebo treated subjects - lower viral load, and improved anti-viral responses.\n\nWe hypothesize that BCG vaccination may induce (partial) protection against susceptibility to and/or severity of COVID-19. This study will evaluate the efficacy of BCG to improve the clinical course of COVID-19 and to prevent absenteeism.\n\nGiven the immediate threat of the COVID-19 epidemic the trial has been designed as a pragmatic study with a highly feasible primary endpoint, that can be continuously measured. We have therefore chosen unplanned absenteeism from work as primary outcome, in line with an ongoing clinical trial of BCG in the Netherlands.\n\nOBJECTIVES Primary objective: To reduce absenteeism among HCW with direct patient contacts during the COVID-19 epidemic. Secondary objective: To reduce the number of HCW that are infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 epidemic and to reduce the number of hospital admissions amongst HCW with direct patient contacts during the COVID-19 epidemic.\n\nHYPOTHESIS BCG vaccination of HCW will reduce absenteeism by 20% over a period of 6 months.\n\nMETHODS\n\nStudy design and follow-up:\n\nA multi-center randomized placebo-controlled trial.\n\nSTUDY POPULATION As the COVID-19 epidemic has already started in Denmark, our intention is to start as soon as possible. Recruitment of study participants will take place at participating hospitals, at departments were COVID-19 patients are treated and, thus, the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 is high.\n\nParticipating hospitals Hospital PI Odense University Hospital Isik Somuncu Johansen Sygehus Lillebælt, Kolding Poul-Erik Kofoed Hvidovre Hospital Thomas Lars Benfield Nordsjællands Hospital Ellen Løkkegaard Aarhus University Hospital Christian Wejse Herning Hospital Lars Skov Dalgaard Sygehus Sønderjylland Christian B. Mogensen\n\nTREATMENT OF SUBJECTS Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receiving one intradermal BCG vaccine or placebo. Participants that are randomized in the active arm will receive a BCG vaccine (BCG-Denmark, AJ Vaccines). Placebo will be 0.1 ml sterile 0.9 % NaCl, which has a similar color as the resuspended BCG vaccine.\n\nSTUDY PROCEDURES Day 0: Participants fill in a short questionnaire regarding baseline characteristics. A blood sample will be drawn for subsequent testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Participants will be randomised to BCG or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Randomisation will be done centrally using the REDCap tool with stratification per hospital and by age groups (+/- 45 years of age) in blocks of 8.\n\nParticipants will be blinded to treatment. The physicians administering the BCG vaccine or placebo will not be blinded. In case of serious adverse events, the participant can be unblinded after consultation with the coordinating PI or sponsor.\n\nThe end of the trial is defined as whichever comes latest: the last patient's last registration in the online data collection, or 180 days.\n\nDay 0 till end of trial (weekly): Short electronic questionnaire regarding work absenteeism, symptoms and side effects through REDCap. In case a participant reports acute respiratory symptoms indicating COVID-19, he or she will be tested depending on test availability.\n\nEnd of trial: Participants are asked to fill in a final questionnaire. A blood sample will be drawn for subsequent testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS All analyses will be performed from the intention-to-treat principle.\n\nPrimary study parameter:\n\nThe primary endpoint will be analysed as counts per week (i.e. multiple observations per subject) using a Bayesian negative binomial regression. Similar regression models will be used for secondary endpoints: Number of days of unplanned absenteeism because of documented COVID; number of days of self-reported fever. Documented COVID, death for any reason, death due to documented COVID, cumulative incidence of Intensive Care Admission for any reason, cumulative incidence of Intensive Care Admission due to documented COVID, cumulative incidence of Hospital Admission for any reason, cumulative incidence of Hospital Admission due to documented COVID will be analysed in Cox proportional hazards models.\n\nWhen applicable (i.e. in the event that one or more participants have died during the follow-up period) a competing events analysis will be performed in addition.\n\nInterim analysis Every month, an interim analysis will be conducted by the independent statistician of the trial. The parallel Dutch trial will enable combined analysis that will strengthen the conclusions and increase the power to analyse the secondary outcomes and more rare outcomes as intensive hospitalization.\n\nETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS The study has ben approved by the Ethics Committee and by the Danish Medicines Agency.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04373291","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

The main cause of death is refractory acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. The SARS-CoV-2 may have specific virulence factors to achieve mortality rates around 3%. As the SARS-CoV, virus responsible of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2003 (which mortality was around 10%), the SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor binding domain for its spike protein making ACE2 the gateway in the alveolar epithelial cells1. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 are known to be present in respiratory epithelium and to have antagonist physiological functions. ACE2 has an anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrosing role, anti-oxydant and vasodilatator activity, while ACE has the opposite characteristics. These two enzymes have a negative control on each other, one inhibiting the other. Demonstrated that SARS-CoV is responsible of a downregulation of ACE2 functions by using ACE2 as cell receptor2. While ACE2 is downregulated, ACE activity increase leading to more alveolar damage and acute respiratory failure.\n\nACE inhibitors are common drugs used to treat hypertension worldwide. Using an ACE inhibitor as treatment against SARS-CoV-2 could be counter-intuitive because increasing ACE2 expression would open the cellular gate to the virus3,4. However, ACE2 was described as protecting lung injury2, leading Recombinant Human ACE2 as a perspective for SARS-CoV-2 treatment.\n\nA simple way to increase ACE2 in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia could be an inhalation of ACE inhibitor.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04355429","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

In the United States, the number of cases of COVID-19 ARDS is projected to exceed the number of available ventilators. Reports from China and Italy indicate that 22-64% of critically ill COVID-19 patients with ARDS will die. ARDS currently has no evidence-based treatments other than low tidal ventilation to limit mechanical stress on the lung and prone positioning. A new therapeutic approach capable of rapidly treating and attenuating ARDS secondary to COVID-19 is urgently needed.\n\nThe dominant pathologic feature of viral-induced ARDS is fibrin accumulation in the microvasculature and airspaces. Substantial preclinical work suggests antifibrinolytic therapy attenuates infection provoked ARDS. In 2001, a phase I trial 7 demonstrated the urokinase and streptokinase were effective in patients with terminal ARDS, markedly improving oxygen delivery and reducing an expected mortality in that specific patient cohort from 100% to 70%. A more contemporary approach to thrombolytic therapy is tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) due to its higher efficacy of clot lysis with comparable bleeding risk 8. We therefore propose a phase IIa clinical trial with two intravenous (IV) tPA treatment arms and a control arm to test the efficacy and safety of IV tPA in improving respiratory function and oxygenation, and consequently, successful extubation, duration of mechanical ventilation and survival.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic accelerates, cases have grown exponentially around the world. Other countries' experience suggests that 5-16% of COVID-19 in-patients will undergo prolonged intensive care with 50-70% needing mechanical ventilation(MV) threatening to overwhelm hospital capacity. ARDS has no effective treatment besides supportive care, the use of ventilation strategies encompassing low tidal volumes that limit trans-pulmonary pressures, and prone positioning in severe disease. Most current trials in clinicaltrials.gov for COVID-19-induced ARDS aim at modulating the inflammatory response or test anti-viral drugs. Sarilumab and tocilizumab that block IL-6 effects are being tested in RCT for patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 (NCT04317092, NCT04322773, NCT04327388). The World Health Organization international trial SOLIDARITY will test remdesivir; chloroquine + hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir + ritonavir; and lopinavir + ritonavir and interferon-beta (NCT04321616). Yet studies targeting the coagulation system, which is intrinsically intertwined with the inflammatory response are lacking.\n\nA consistent finding in ARDS is the deposition of fibrin in the airspaces and lung parenchyma, along with fibrin-platelet microthrombi in the pulmonary vasculature, which contribute to the development of progressive respiratory dysfunction and right heart failure. Similar to pathologic findings of ARDS, microthrombi have now been observed in lung specimens from patients infected with COVID-19.\n\nInappropriate activation of the clotting system in ARDS results from enhanced activation and propagation of clot formation as well as suppression of fibrinolysis. Our group has shown that low fibrinolysis is associated with ARDS. Studies starting decades ago have demonstrated the systemic and local effects of dysfunctional coagulation in ARDS, specifically related to fibrin. This occurs largely because of excessive amounts of tissue factor that is produced by alveolar epithelial cells and activated alveolar macrophages, and high levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) produced and released by endothelial cells. Consistent with this, generalized derangements of the hemostatic system with prolongation of the prothrombin time, elevated D-dimer and fibrin degradation products have been reported in severely ill COVID-19 patients, particularly in non-survivors. These laboratory findings, in combination with the large clot burden seen in the pulmonary microvasculature, mirrors what is seen in human sepsis, experimental endotoxemia, and massive tissue trauma. Targeting the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems to improve the treatment of ARDS has been proposed for at least the past two decades. In particular, the use of plasminogen activators to limit ARDS progression and reduce ARDS-induced death has received strong support from animal models, and a phase 1 human clinical trial. In 2001, Hardaway and colleagues showed that administration of either urokinase or streptokinase to patients with terminal ARDS reduced the expected mortality from 100% to 70% with no adverse bleeding events. Importantly, the majority of patients who ultimately succumbed died from renal or hepatic failure, rather than pulmonary failure.\n\nConsideration of therapies that are widely available but not recognized for this indication and traditionally considered \"high-risk\" such as fibrinolytic agents is warranted in this unprecedented public health emergency, since the risk of adverse events from tPA is far outweighed by the extremely high risk of death in the patient's meeting the eligibility criteria for this trial. While the prior studies by Hardaway et al evaluating fibrinolytic therapy for treatment of ARDS used urokinase and streptokinase, the more contemporary approach to thrombolytic therapy involves the use of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) due to higher efficacy of clot lysis with comparable bleeding risk to the other fibrinolytic agents.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04357730","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

However, it is not known if early administration of HDIVC could prevent progression to ARDS.\n\nWe hypothesize that HDIVC is safe and tolerable in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) subjects given early or late in the disease course and may reduce the risk of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and development of ARDS along with reductions in supplemental oxygen demand and inflammatory markers.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nThe purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, potential efficacy of high dose intravenous vitamin C (HDIVC) therapy for patients with COVID-19 and decreased oxygenation. COVID-19 is a rapidly evolving pandemic with numerous prediction models suggesting potential shortages in ventilators, ICU beds, and high rates of hospital mortality. Case-series suggest sepsis and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are driving hospitalizations, morbidity (ICU beds, ventilator use, organ failures), and mortality. A therapy is urgently needed to be given early in the disease course in order to attenuate the infectious and inflammatory process, reduce risk of intubation, and reduce progression of organ failure and ARDS. By administering HDIVC at the first objective sign of worsening oxygenation, documented by change in peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) ratio (S/F) or decreased SpO2 at baseline (mild hypoxia group), HDIVC may reduce the inflammatory process and development of respiratory failure requiring intubation. We will also enroll patients already in respiratory failure on ventilators (severe hypoxia group) and document safety and tolerability in both cohorts. By calculating ventilator and ICU-free days, we can potentially signal clinically relevant endpoints that could be used in larger trials needed to answer a crucial therapeutic question—can early administration of HDIVC in COVID-19 lead to faster recovery or improve outcomes? Moreover, we will document change in inflammatory markers that are elevated in COVID-19 (d-dimer, CRP, LDH, liver enzymes, and ferritin) to develop a mechanistic understanding and risk stratification of response to HDIVC infusion. Ultimately, if HDIVC is deemed safe and tolerable in hospitalized COVID-19 subjects, a larger clinical trial will be indicated. AVoCaDO will produce safety and tolerability data to test HDIVC in a multi-center, rapid, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of subjects with COVID-19.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04357782","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Avoiding transmission of COVID-19 to front-line health care workers in Ontario with optimal Protective Personal Equipment (PPE) is a public health priority to prevent attrition of the health care work force at a time when it is most needed to care for the needs of Ontarians.\n\nHealth care workers performing Aerosol Generating Medical Procedures (AGMPs) (e.g. endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy and tracheostomies) are at particularly high risk of infection. 1During AGMPs, medical personnel are contaminated with virus-loaded micro-droplets3 that may be suspended in the air for up to 3 hours.4\n\nUse of effective PPE is paramount in protecting health care workers during these high-risk procedures. Limited world-wide supplies of PPE and disruption of supply chains is a current concern. Having local sources of PPE production could help secure supply and protect Ontario's health care work force.\n\nCurrent standard PPE equipment used during high-risk procedures in Ontario includes a fit-tested N95 mask, an open face shield, a procedure gown and double extended-cuff gloves. This level of PPE leaves certain areas of the head and neck exposed to contamination with viral aerosol and droplets, and could be a source for self-contamination despite meticulous donning and doffing. In fact, extensive contamination of the front surfaces, the neck, forearms, wrists and hands has been previously identified during simulation of medical procedures.5 Contamination of the upper body, especially the head and neck, hands and wrists poses the highest risk of potential infection as viral contaminants in these parts of the body are most likely to reach the mucosal surfaces of the mouth, nose and eyes, which are the recognized entry points of viral infection.\n\nWe propose to design and test a protective hood to be used in place of the open shield to provide enhanced coverage of the upper body during high risk procedures. This hood would be used along an N95 mask, procedure gown and double extended-cuff gloves, allowing for effective barrier protection against SARS-CoV-2 rich droplets and microdroplets by providing the physician with a barrier that covers his/her upper torso from contamination.\n\nIn partnership with 2 Ontario companies (MVF & Associates and Piedmont Plastics) we have designed a hood to cover the entire upper body from the head down to the elbows. The hood is made of polypropylene spunbond nonwoven fabric, a waterproof, air permeable material and a polycarbonate visor.\n\nThe use of a hood could positively impact the safety of airway management and other AGMPs during the pandemic by reducing contamination of the upper body. The proposed study is important because it is the first one to evaluate the potential impact of a hood to enhance PPE. Ultimately, decreased levels of contamination by droplets may effectively reduce the risk of health care worker infection by SARS CoV2 virus after an AGMP such as endotracheal intubation.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04373096","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Meditation mobile applications, such as the \"Calm\" app, can be used to help manage stress, especially during this uncertain time.

The COVID-19 public health crisis requires the full resources and attention of healthcare systems. This has led to several healthcare changes that affect physicians in training, including changes to rotations and schedules, risks of infection exposure to themselves or their families, and the unknown impacts this may have on their residency and fellowship experiences.\n\nThese changes are likely impacting their stress, health, and well-being. Physician burnout is major concern for the medical community and likely to be further impacted by the current pandemic. Evidence-based interventions for stress include cognitive behavior therapy, although this can be time consuming, requires the need for specialized providers, and is not feasible for everyone during this COVID-19 pandemic. Pharmacotherapy can be used, including antidepressants and anxiolytics, however they have inherent limitations such as side effects, tolerance, and interactions that limit their use. Consumer based mobile applications (apps) may help individuals with self-management strategies for stress (1). Mindfulness meditation is one type of self-management strategy and is the practice of moment-to-moment awareness in which the person purposefully focuses on the present without judgement (1,2).\n\n\"Calm\" is a mobile app that offers a range of meditation lessons, sleep stories (bed-time stories for grown-ups), sleep music, and nature sounds with modules that vary in length, instruction, and content. Few studies on the use of \"Calm\" exist and include a randomized controlled trial evaluating its affect to decrease stress among college students and a descriptive study evaluating cancer patient's perceptions of the app (1,3). There is evidence to support the use of similar apps in resident physicians. A pilot study assessing the effects of a meditation app on resident wellness suggested both the feasibility and efficacy of such an intervention (4). During these unprecedented times of the COVID-19 pandemic, mobile apps such as Calm may be potentially beneficial to help with stress in house staff physicians, although this requires further investigation.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04374786","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

The rapid spread of the associated disease, COVID-19, has overwhelmed healthcare systems in spite of unprecedented measures to reduce contagion. The resulting uncertainty with regard to the duration and magnitude of the pandemic and limited availability of resources and treatment have been detrimental to the mental health of frontline healthcare providers (NIH). Preserving the psychological wellbeing of these individuals is paramount to mitigating the effect of COVID-19 and delivering optimal patient care.\n\nOf particularly grave concern is how professional and personal distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic will affect provider burnout (Lai et al. JAMA Network Open 2020). Professional burnout, characterized by emotional exhaustion, career de-prioritization, and loss of self-efficacy, represents a significant threat to the US healthcare system (Shanafelt et al. Ann Surg 2010; Han et al. Annals of Internal Medicine 2019). While burnout has been described as a reaction to chronic work-related stress (Melamed et al. Psychol. Bull. 2006), individual factors such as anxiety increase susceptibility to burnout (Sun et al. J Occup Health 2012). Although data suggests that occupational stress might amplify risk of anxiety (DiGiacomo and Adamson J Allied Health 2001), we have yet to understand how intensified anxiety among frontline providers during global health crises contributes to burnout. Similarly, it is unknown whether factors such as perceived organizational support (POS), a key driver of job satisfaction and performance (Muse and Stamper, J Managerial Issues 2007), modify anxiety and burnout under these circumstances. We hypothesize that diminished POS in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with burnout and that this relationship is mediated by an increase in providers' anxiety. Delineating this relationship is a critical first step in developing interventions that ease the mental health burden of this pandemic and future crises for healthcare providers.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04370938","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

They will begin early treatment with anakinra in the effort to prevent progression in serious respiratory failure. Also due to the potential co-existing immunodysfunction in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection patients will also receive trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole as part of chemoprophylaxis.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nThe major hurdle of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the early recognition of the patients at high risk for the development of severe respiratory failure (SRF). If this can be achieved early, then appropriate immunomodulatory treatment may be administered to prevent development of SRF. This scenario is extremely visionary since it prevents the development of the major fatal consequence of COVID-19 but also alleviates the heavy medical and financial burden of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission.\n\nCurrent evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 activates endothelial function which leads to over-production of D-dimers. Urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) is anchored to the cell membranes of the lung endothelial cells. As result of the activation of kallikrein, uPAR is cleaved and enters the systemic circulation as the soluble counterpart suPAR. Preliminary unpublished data from 57 Greek patients hospitalized after March 1st, 2020 in Greek hospitals due to pneumonia by confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection showed that those with suPAR admission levels ≥ 6 ng/ml had greater risk for the development of SRF within 14 days than patients with suPAR less than 6ng/ml. The sensitivity of suPAR to detect these patients was 85.9% and the positive predictive value 85.9%. It needs to be underlined that all 21 Greek patients with suPAR≥ 6ng/ml were under treatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. These data were confirmed in 15 patients hospitalized for pneumonia by SARS-CoV-2 in Rush Medical Center at Chicago.\n\nThis prognostic ability of suPAR for unfavourable outcome is not presented for the first time; in the TRIAGE III trial that was conducted among 4,420 admissions in the emergency department in Denmark the interquartile range of suPAR was between 2.6 and 4.7 ng/ml in 30-day survivors and between 6.7 and 11.8 ng/ml in 30-day non-survivors. Previous data from the Hellenic Sepsis Study Group on 1,914 patients clearly shows a high prognostic utility of admission suPAR for 28-day mortality.\n\nIt is obvious that suPAR can early identify the start of such a type of inflammatory process in the lung parenchyma that has will soon be intensified. A recent publication has shown that this is due to the early release of interleukin-1α (IL-1α) from lung epithelial cells that are infected by the virus. This IL-1α acts as a promoting factor that stimulates the production of IL-1β and of a further cytokine storm from alveolar macrophages.\n\nAnakinra is the only marketed product that inhibits both IL-1β and IL-1α and hence it is able to block an inflammatory response early on and to prevent the downstream inflammatory cascade. suPAR can be used as the biomarker tool to indicate patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in risk of SRF and for whom early start of anakinra may prevent development of SRF.\n\nAnakinra is a safe drug that has been licensed for chronic subcutaneous administration in rheumatoid arthritis, refractory gout and chronic auto-inflammatory disorders. The safety profile was further proven when it was administered in two randomized clinical trials where more than 1,500 critically ill patients with severe sepsis were intravenously treated.\n\nChemoprophylaxis in HIV-free patients with some form of immunosuppression is considered effective. Given the active inflammatory process in the pulmonary parenchyma, hypercytokinemia, co-existing lymphopenia and the dysregulation of the immune response accompanying COVID-19 disease patients will also receive trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole as part of chemoprophylaxis.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04357366","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Establishing the correct time to extubate mechanically ventilated patients is a crucial issue in the critical care practice. Delayed extubation has several consequences such as patient's mortality, health-care-related complications, neuropsychological adverse events. The aim of the INVICTUS study is to evaluate whether a CTUS-based MV weaning strategy could reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation of ARDS COVID-19 ICU patients by 72 hours, compared with usual medical care.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nIdentifying patients at risk for postextubation distress using standard clinical criteria and the only available test we have, that is, the spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) remains a challenging issue2. A cumulative body of evidence suggest that the decision to attempt extubation might be assisted by the use of thoracic ultrasound. This non-invasive, reproducible and fully bedside approach is able to provide accurate information about respiratory, cardiac and neuromuscular functions which are independent predictors of extubation outcome. Recently, we have demonstrated that a combined thoracic ultrasound (CTUS) strategy based on lung ultrasound, echocardiography and diaphragm ultrasonographic assessment data performs better than routine clinical assessment to evaluate extubation readiness in medical and surgical ICU patients3. CTUS appears as a unique point of care precision medicine prognostic and diagnostic tool for the management of patients experiencing ARDS. Based on those premises, we hypothesize that CTUS-based MV weaning strategy could reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation of ARDS COVID-19 ICU patients by 72 hours, compared with usual medical care. This research is a national, multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label, in parallel group.

In CTUS strategy group, a combined CTUS examination will be performed until the day of patient extubation. CTUS examination will consist on a fully bedside ultrasonographic assessment of lung, cardiac and diaphragm functions. In standard strategy group, from the day of patient's inclusion and beyond every day, the clinical team in charge of patients will decide to perform or not an SBT following current recommendations2.

It is a devastating clinical condition, caused by an acute and diffuse lung injury that requires management in the intensive care unit. It is caused by uncontrolled inflammation that leads to severe pulmonary alveolar damage and capillary membrane leakage, and progressive respiratory failure. There is no effective treatment for ARDS and the only supportive care strategies are the mainstay of therapy. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have high regenerative and immunomodulatory capacities. In preclinical research, ARDS, MSCs modulate the inflammatory response, augment tissue repair, enhance pathogen clearance, and reduce the severity of the injury, pulmonary dysfunction, and apoptosis. Moreover, many studies have shown that the anti-inflammatory effects of MSCs can significantly reduce virus (e.g., Influenza)-induced lung injury and mortality in animals. Since 2014 clinical trials are using MSC from variable sources [bone marrow (BM), fat, and umbilical cord (UC)] in the treatment of ARDS. Some of the clinical trials are ongoing and the final reports are not reported. In all final reports, the safety of the application of MSC has been documented and most of them implied improvement in mortality and decrease of morbidity. Moreover, experimental studies have demonstrated that MSCs or their extracellular vesicles (MSCs-EVs) significantly reduced lung inflammation and pathological impairment resulting from different types of lung injury. Also, macrophage phagocytosis, bacterial killing, and the outcome are improved. It is highly likely that MSCs-EVs have the same therapeutic effect on inoculation pneumonia as MSCs themselves.\n\nCritically ill coronavirus documented cases suspicious to ARDS (mild or moderate) will be enrolled in the study.

Animal and human studies support immune modulating effects of estrogen that are acute acting in viral infections and wound repair processes that may reduce the damaging effects of the virus on the lung and symptom severity.\n\nOur hypothesis is that a short 7 day course of estradiol delivered in a transdermal patch applied to the upper buttock in COVID19+ or presumptive positive patients will be safe and will reduce symptom severity in adult men and older women when given prior to intubation. COVID19+ and presumptive positive patients not requiring intubation will be enrolled to the study and randomized to receive an estrogen patch or standard of care. Patients will be followed up at day 1, 7, 14 and 28 for clinical symptoms and disease outcomes.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04359329","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

The first case of this unprecedented outbreak \"pneumonia of unknown etiology\" was reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China on December 8th, 2019 and reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on December 31st, 2019. WHO declared a COVID-19 global emergency on January 30, 2020, and then categorized the outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. As of April 22, 2020, more than 2,628,894 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide and 182,740 people globally have died from COVID-19 since it emerged in China, according to the data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nWhile the majority of patients with COVID-19 develop mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 20-30% of hospitalized patients have required intensive care support and 5% of those have multi-organ failure or shock. The case fatality rate ranges from 1 to 4% and it is higher among those with pre-existing comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, obesity, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension and cancer. The vast majority of patients present with fever (83-99%), cough (59-82%), fatigue (44-70%), anorexia (40-84%), shortness of breath (31-40%), sputum production (28-33%), myalgias (11-35%). Less than 10% of patients will present with headache, confusion, rhinorrhea, sore throat, hemoptysis, vomiting, or diarrhea. Anosmia or ageusia proceeding the onset of respiratory symptoms has been anecdotally reported.\n\nTo date, treatments for COVID-19 in high risks individuals remain experimental and therapeutic strategies to deal with the infection are at best supportive, with prevention aimed at reducing transmission in the community as the best weapon. No proven therapies have been demonstrated to prevent the progression of COVID-19 to severe illness and this is a critical unmet need for high-risk individuals and warrants study. Recently, the Infectious Disease Society of America has made recommendations for the treatment of patients with COVID-19, focusing on inpatient care, and recommending randomized trials where possible as the best step to improve treatment outcomes and to increase our understanding of this coronavirus pandemic. Discoveries in this area may inform clinicians on effective treatment for low-risk individuals who progress to severe illness, as well.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04374019","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

This virus is transmitted from person to person through close contacts or respiratory droplets. Symptoms usually start 4 or 5 days after exposure. Some common symptoms include fever, dry cough, feeling tired, muscle aches, and trouble breathing. Although it may affect all organs in our body, it mainly attacks our lungs' ability to help us breathe.\n\nThere are currently no FDA approved medications to treat COVID-19 infection. Patients are given medications to help alleviate the symptoms. When patients are admitted to the hospital, they are given medications to reduce fever, relieve pain and supplement oxygen. In severe cases, patients are put on a ventilator, a machine designed to to support the lungs. There are a number of drugs undergoing clinical study to see if they are effective in treating the COVID-19 virus.\n\nAt Maimonides Medical Center, the investigators are taking the appropriate steps to find an effective treatment for COVID-19. The COMBAT COVID-19 Pilot Study is designed for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection who require oxygen supplementation to be treated with colchicine to reduce the chance of needing a mechanical ventilator.\n\nColchicine is an FDA approved medication that is used to treat inflammatory disorders such as Gout and Familial Mediterranean Fever. It has also been used to treat other inflammatory conditions such as inflammation around the heart and been demonstrated to help patients who have had an acute heart attack. Colchicine is a readily available drug which is usually well tolerated by patients. The investigators believe that colchicine may reduce the inflammation in the lungs. If so, the lungs may be able heal at a quicker pace and we hope that this may reduce the need for mechanical ventilation.\n\nThe research will be a randomized trial, patient will be randomly selected to be in either the colchicine treatment group or the standard medicines group. The treatment group will receive colchicine for 14 days or until the day of discharge. The standard medicines group will receive the usual medical therapy as determined by attending physician.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nSTUDY OBJECTIVES\n\nTo demonstrate that Colchicine in moderate/high-risk COVID patients:\n\nReduces the need for oxygen supplementation beyond 8L nasal cannula\nReduces the need for mechanical ventilation\nReduces max troponin elevations\nReduces inflammatory markers\nReduces length of hospitalization\nReduces mortality\n\nHYPOTHESIS The investigators hypothesize that treatment with colchicine in COVID-19 moderate/high-risk patients may decrease the risk of progression into ARDS requiring increased oxygen requirements, mechanical ventilation, and mortality.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN Prospective, completely randomized, open labeled, controlled study. Patients will be randomized into two groups (A and B). Patients of group A will be treated under what is considered current standard of care at Maimonides Medical Center while group B patients will receive colchicine in addition to standard of care.\n\nTreatment arm\n\nIn addition to the local standard of care for COVID 19 patients, the patient will receive colchicine PO as such:\n\nLoading dose of 1.2 mg followed by 0.6mg after 2 hours if without significant gastrointestinal symptoms (day 1)\nThe next day 0.6mg bid for 14 days or until discharge\n\nPatients who are on HMG-Co A Reductase Inhibitors (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin), fibrates, genfibrozil, amiodarone, dronedarone or digoxin should have the colchicine dosage reduced to a loading dose of 0.6mg followed by 0.3mg after two hours (day 1) followed by 0.3mg BID for 14 days or until discharge.\n\nIf patients have significant gastrointestinal symptoms after loading, the dosage may be reduced to 0.3mg BID for the rest of the 14 day course or until discharge. If gastrointestinal symptoms continue, the medication should then be discontinued. Patients who experience sensory motor neuropathy, or symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with rhabdomyolysis should prompt immediate discontinuation of the drug. If renal function deteriorates during the treatment course and CrCl <30ml/min, colchicine should also be discontinued.\n\nControl arm Usual medical therapy (can include medications such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin)\n\nPatients should NOT receive Steroids (IV/PO), Remdesivir, IL-6 inhibitors (Tociluzimab, Sarilumab), JAK inhibitors, IL-1 inhibitors, or other immunomodulators for COVID-19 after randomization while not intubated. Since the primary clinical endpoint is progression of disease, if the patient requires mechanical ventilation, the primary clinical endpoint is met and the above experimental salvage medications will be permitted. To rephrase, the patient will be allowed steroids, Remdesivir, IL-6 inhibitors and other immunomodulators only after intubation if deemed medically necessary by the treating physician.\n\nSubjects:\n\nEligibility Criteria:\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\nMales and females\n>=18 years of age\nWilling and able to provide written informed consent prior to performing study procedures\nCurrently hospitalized and requiring medical care for COVID-19\nPatient must have a positive COVID-19 PCR result\nPeripheral capillary oxygen saturation <94% on room air at screening\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\nRequirement of oxygen supplementation >8L nasal cannula\nPregnancy\nKnown hypersensitivity to colchicine\nPatient currently in shock or with hemodynamic instability requiring pressors\nHistory of cirrhosis\nAlanine Aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > 5X upper limit of normal (ULN)\nPatients with severe renal disease, CrCl <30ml/min\nPatients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation at screening or Clinical estimation that the patient will require mechanical respiratory support within 24 hours\nPatient is currently taking colchicine for other indications (gout or Familial Mediterranean Fever)\nPatient received IV or PO steroids during the hospitalization\nPatient received Remdesivir, Sarilumab, Tociluzimab, Lopinavir/Ritonavir or other immunomodulator given for COVID-19 treatment\nPatient is on (and cannot discontinue) a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (eg clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, atazanavir), a moderate CYP3A4 inhbitor (eg diltiazem, verapamil, fluconazole, amprenavir, aprepitant, fosamprenavir) or a P-gp Inhibitor (eg cyclosporine, ranolazine)\nPatient is undergoing chemotherapy for cancer\nPatient is considered by the investigator, for any reason, to be unsuitable candidate for the study\nPatient received Remdesivir, Sarilumab, Tociluzimab, Lopinavir/Ritonavir or other immunomodulator given for COVID-19 treatment (convalescent plasma is NOT an exclusion)\n\nDesign: The pilot study is a prospective randomized study involving colchicine in the experimental arm. The study will be performed in the inpatient wards at Maimonides Medical Center.\n\nData Collection Procedures: Data will be collected from Sunrise Clinical Manager Electronic records at Maimonides Medical Center.\n\nPatients with COVID-19 infection are usually assessed with laboratory tests to determine their inflammatory state. Markers such as CRP, troponin, LDH and Ferritin, and IL6 level are used routinely during the patient's hospitalization. These markers are also frequently repeated during the hospitalization to gauge a patient's clinical status. At the time of study randomization, a set of these markers will be obtained if not already obtained in the prior 24 hours. We recommend clinical follow up of these markers as medically indicated by the treating physician. We recommend ascertainment of a peak troponin elevation during the hospitalization and peak CRP as would be expected in standard medical care.\n\nBiochemical end points\n\nMaximum troponin elevation\nMaximum CRP; Time (days) from colchicine initiation to achieve CRP <1\n\nClinical end points\n\nPRIMARY:\n\n○ Percentage of patients who require escalation of supplemental oxygen beyond low-flow nasal cannula (>8L/min)\n\nSECONDARY:\n\nPercentage of patients who will require mechanical ventilation\nHospital length of stay\nMortality\n\nSafety Monitoring The investigators anticipate colchicine to have an excellent safety profile given the medication's widespread use in the outpatient and inpatient setting. However outcome data at each 20 patients will be evaluated to ensure there are no adverse events which would would necessitate pausing or discontinuation of the study. A signal for adverse events will be discussed internally with the investigators and reported to the IRB. Serious adverse events will be reported within 24 hours to the IRB.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04363437","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

SARS-CoV-2 is infecting thousands of people in the world with a fatality rate that varies from 0.1 to 5% in affected countries, thereby causing enormous economic losses. Few antibiotics have shown any efficacy in their combat, but have not yet proven adequate to stop the spread of the disease, nor are there any approved vaccines at the moment. From experiments in plants ongoing infections by RNA viruses, using thermotherapy, which is the application of heat at a temperature between 35-43 °C, the investigators know that raising the temperature affects the transcription of viral proteins due to the formation of small RNA molecules that interrupt the replication process by grouping in specific regions of the RNA molecule, preventing and inhibiting transcription. These small molecules are called small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). This feature has been used through thermotherapy in humans to combat the rapid replication of cells (i.e. cancer cells), attack cells infected by RNA viruses, and in the treatment of some parasitic infections.There are various commercially available devices for thermotherapy use in humans; they are mainly being used to ease muscle pain. They work by increasing the temperature in the range recommended for thermotherapy in humans 39-43 ° C. Therefore, the investigators consider this treatment modality can be used to aid in the elimination of SARS-CoV-2 from the human body, decreasing viral load, which could allow the immune system time for its control and elimination.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nConsidering the nature of the causative agent of COVID-19, a (+)ssRNA virus, the investigators propose the use of thermotherapy as a modality for viral containment, thereby preventing the progression of the infection to severe cases. The investigators consider applying the intervention with thermotherapy mainly as an adjuvant therapy in high-risk patients. The most accessible thermotherapy delivery method the investigators have identified is the use of an electric chest pad for its wide and known clinical use, including its recommended use for patients with arthritis. The intensity of temperature delivered by the electric cushion should be placed on the first level (lowest level), to avoid discomfort to the patient. The electric cushion provides a continuous hour of regulated heat, with enough penetration to raise the external temperature of the area to 40-42 ° C, a temperature range at which facilitation of elimination of the virus is expected.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04363541","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Approximately 25% of hospitalized patients require treatment in intensive care units and 10% require mechanical ventilation. The diagnosis is made by the molecular polymerase chain reaction test. However, diagnostic tests are limited. The clinical care of the patient with COVID-19 is similar to that of patients with severe infectious respiratory complications, consisting of support and oxygen supplementation. Several medications have been tested as remdesivir, a pro-drug nucleoside, which acts by inhibiting viral RNA transcription, although a recently published study has shown no benefit. China recently approved the use of favipiravir, an antiviral used for influenza, as an experimental therapy for COVID-19.

These factors are age, high SOFA score, and high D-dimer.\nTo evaluate the titration of antiCOVID-19 antibodies and if its quantification is related to the therapeutic response.\n\nThe responses to drug treatments that exist in our country such as hydroxychloroquine ± azithromycin, lopinavir / ritonavir and tocilizumab (anti-IL-6) are very heterogeneous, with high cost and diverse and serious adverse events in some cases. Absent randomized-controlled studies and case series or small cohort studies have not been shown to be more effective than supportive treatments in these patients. One more factor is that intubated patients cannot swallow and these medications are for oral posology; the only way to administer is through a nasogastric tube, so we cannot assure that its absorption is as expected and that the blood levels do not reach therapeutic levels.\n\nTherefore, we propose a treatment that in the first instance is in our hands, which has already proven to be effective in infection with highly pathogenic viruses such as Ebola virus, Lassar fever and other coronavirus infections (SARS1 in 2003, MERS 2012). With regard to convalescent plasma, two studies have recently been published, a series of 5 and another of 10 cases, seriously ill and with no response to the mentioned therapies (hydroxychloroquine ± azithromycin and lopinavir / ritonavir, among others). The outcomes in this series of cases have been reported satisfactory in most with few minimal adverse events (rash).\n\nSince the convalescent plasma dose is very ambiguous in the case-series reported, we will try to find this dose. Therefore, in this initial phase, we divided it into two severity groups:\n\n. Severe ill group, convalescent plasma dose on day 0, evaluation on day +3 and if you continue with the clinic and laboratories, a second dose of plasma may be administered. Always watching the safety always (early and late transfusion reactions). Clinical evaluation (including oxygenation) as well as laboratory (days +6, +9, +12, +15, +18, +21 to find the necessary dose for response. The patients will be evaluated and if they meet the response points, the minimum effective plasma dose will be recommended for phase 2.\n. Very severe ill group, convalescent plasma dose day 0, with evaluation on day +3, will add another dose of plasma if there is no improvement clinic or laboratory, reevaluate day +6 and if required, apply another dose of plasma if there will be not clinical or laboratory improvement. Always watching security. It is reassessed clinically (including respiratory parameters) on days +9, +12, +15, +18 and +21, to find the minimal dose necessary. This sequential treatment will help reduce the risk of water overload and also assess the presence of transfusion lung injury syndrome or TRALI. A second phase, the dose and safety of treatment will be evaluated.\n\nIn the second phase , both early and late or B will be evaluated as follows:\n\nto. Sever ill cases: plasma will be applied according to the dose you will find in phase 1b. Security and response will be evaluated in this phase.\n\nb. Very sever ill cases: Plasma will be applied according to the dose you will find in phase 1b and the safety and response phase will be evaluated.\n\nIt will also be open (the study will not be blinded), it will not be randomized, and it will be controlled only by the severity of the patient and their characteristics of the disease (severe vs. very severe), as well as being controlled by the amount of infusion of plasma (minimum effective dose).\n\nSECURITY ANALYSIS\n\nThe security analysis will be between the researchers in the group and another externak group. They will analyze the first 5 patients in each group (severe and very severe), the main objective for security analysis is going to be mortality related directly to plasma infusion. Subsequently, every 20 patients in each group for phase 2 will be analyzed for safety and response.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04356482","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Regarding the functioning of the Maternities, it was decided by the three Maternities of AP-HP. Sorbonne University of the Pitié-Salpêtrière, Trousseau and Tenon sites, from March 20, 2020 to no longer authorize visits during the stay of mothers following childbirth. This prohibition has also been extended to spouses. This measure was guided by a concern to protect both the patients, their newborn and the entire staff of the aftermath.\n\nThe period surrounding a birth is a period of strong emotional impact with an incidence of postpartum depression estimated at 15% in the general population (1). The separation of women from their spouses during this period could expose them to greater psychological vulnerability. In addition, when they return home, the patients will be isolated from their relatives due to the quarantine, which is an additional risk factor for postpartum depression. The teams of the three maternity units of AP-HP. Sorbonne University have organized themselves to be able to respond to situations of mental vulnerability during their stay with the intervention of maternity psychologists and psychiatrists and child psychiatrists as is done in the treatment usual charge. In addition, anticipating situations of greater vulnerability linked to the health crisis, the Maternity teams decided to set up a follow-up of patients after their return home through a telephone interview with psychologists or student psychologists in Master at D10 - D12 and 6-8 weeks postpartum in order to identify patients at increased risk of postpartum depression and to set up appropriate management if necessary for these patients.\n\nWe therefore propose through this project to describe the consequences of this separation from the spouse during the postpartum stay and then with the family after returning home within the context of quarantine by assessing the incidence of post-partum depression during this sanitary crisis. A telephone interview of all the patients will be proposed on D10 - D12 and at 6-8 weeks postpartum using specific questionnaire to calculate a score of depression. This early identification will allow the establishment of an adapted psychological follow-up.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nThe main objective of this study is to assess the emotional impact of the separation of women from their spouses following childbirth and their family isolation when returning home within the context of quarantine due to the COVID epidemic.\n\nThe secondary objectives are:\n\nTo identify the factors of greatest vulnerability or resilience of the patients in the immediate postpartum period (6-8 weeks after delivery).\nTo evaluate the impact of quarantine on the couples (DAS-16 scale), the experience of childbirth (PPQ scale), mother-child interactions (MIBS) at D10-D12 postpartum and at 6-8 weeks postpartum.\nRecording of all interviews allowing a qualitative study of the verbatim by the use of N-Vivo software allowing the analysis of unstructured and qualitative data.\n\nThe primary endpoint will be the proportion of patients with postpartum depression defined by EPDS score >12 at D10-12 and 6-8 weeks postpartum. The EPDS relies on 10 specific items which allows the calculation of a depression score. A threshold > 12 is used in research to define the existence of depressive symptoms. For research, the score can be used as a continuous variable or in class with the threshold value 12.\n\nThe secondary end points will be:\n\nto study factors of greatest vulnerability or resilience of the patients will be studied:\n\nSocio-economic data\nmaternal or fetal pathology during previous pregnancies\nassociated pregnancy pathology\nMaternal psychologic history\n\nto describe the impact on the couple (DAS-16 scale), the experience of childbirth (PPQ scale), mother-child interactions (MIBS):\n\nDyadic Adjustment scale 16 (DAS-16). Revised scale was developed to assess dyadic adjustment in marriage.\nPerinatal Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Questionnaire (PPQ). This self-questionnaire makes it possible to assess the post-traumatic reactions of parents faced with the birth of a child presenting a high perinatal risk.\nMother-to-Infant Bonding Scale (MIBS): Auto questionnaire, initially developed with a view to researching disturbances in maternal feelings towards the newborn. The scores range from 0 to 24, a high score being in favor of a mother-child bond disorder.\nAutomated psycho-linguistic analysis of the interviews using the N Vivo software. This software allows an automated study of the verbatim allowing a qualitative analysis of prosody and to identify emotional profiles and thus to identify situations of anxiety, stress and depression.\n\nThe study population will consist of patients with delivery of a child and:\n\nSingleton pregnancy\nAlive child without hospitalization of the child in NICU\nPatient speaking and understanding French\nMajor patient\n\nDuration of inclusion will be 2 months The Inclusion visit will take place during hospitalization in post-partum units, signed consent informed will be collected by a qualified person (medical doctor or midwife) before inclusion. Each week, these forms will be sent to the study psychologist referent in each of the 3 Maternity units.\n\nResearch follow-up visits:\n\nScheduled telephone interview using the assessment scales described above on D10-D12 and 6-8 weeks postpartum with a psychologist or an M2 psychology student under the responsibility of a maternity psychologist. A reminder system is provided by sending an SMS / email 48 hours before the scheduled call. In the event of a missed call, a re-call is scheduled on the same day or the next day (the SMS / email sent to patients indicates this reminder mode in the event of unavailability during the first call).\n\nDuring this call, a semi-structured interview is carried out with EPDS score, DAS-16 scale, PPQ and MIBS questionnaire, and a recording for analysis of unstructured and qualitative data.\n\nWhen EPDS score> 12: proposal for psychological follow-up in accordance with current standard of care in the event of postpartum depression.\n\nFor scores <12, the possibility of a further interview with a psychologist, apart from the study, is formulated.\n\nTelephone interview at 6-8 weeks with psychologist including, as previously described, a semi-structured interview with EPDS score, DAS-16 scale and MIBS questionnaire and a recording for analysis of unstructured and qualitative data When EPDS score> 12: proposal for psychological follow-up in accordance with current standard of care in the event of postpartum depression.\n\nFor scores <12, the possibility of a further interview with a psychologist is formulated.\n\nThe patients were informed of the recording of the calls. In case of refusal, the calls are not recorded and only the semi-structured interview is carried out with EPDS score and DAS-16 scale and PPQ and MIBS questionnaire.\n\nSample size justification The inclusion of 452 women will allow to detect at least a 5 points change in the proportion of postpartum depression during COVID pandemic period compared to the expected/usual proportion of 15% (15 vs. 20%) with 80% of power, considering two-sided alpha risk of 5% and 5% of dropout.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04366817","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

This study intends to define the impact of aerosolized intra-tracheal Dornase Alpha administration on the severity and progression of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients.

NETs have been shown to be involved in bronchoalveolar congestion and amplification of the inflammatory response during viral pneumonia responsible for ARDS. Deoxyribonuclease 1 (DNAse 1) is an enzyme capable of cutting apart extracellular DNA strands, the backbone of NETs.

Prophylactic-dose anticoagulation is generally recommended for acutely ill hospitalized patients. However, given the hemostatic abnormalities of severe COVID-19 illness, it is unknown whether more intensive anticoagulation is preferred to reduce the risk of thrombotic events, potentially mitigating microvascular and macrovascular thrombi and even disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Further, the risks of therapeutic dose anticoagulation must be weighed against the bleeding risks inherent to this approach.

It is a challenge to provide consistent care in this situation of high demand and potential staff shortage in ICU. Also, the investigators need to reduce unnecessary exposure of the providers to the virus. This study aims to examine the impact of care using a non-invasive oscillating device (NIOD) for chest physiotherapy in the care of mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19.\n\nMETHODS Objective: To explore if a NIOD performed by non-specialized personnel is not inferior to the standard Chest PhysioTherapy (CPT) in the care of COVID-19.\n\nDesign: A Pilot Multicenter Prospective Crossover Randomized Study. Setting: Two ICUs in Canadian Academic Hospitals (CHU Sainte Justine and Montreal General Hospital) Patients: All the mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the two ICUs, and CPT ordered by the responsible physician, with COVID-19 infection during the study period.\n\nProcedure: The investigators will implement NIOD and CPT alternatingly for 3 hours apart over 3 hours. We will apply a pragmatic design, so that other procedures including hypertonic saline nebulization, Intermittent Positive Pressure Ventilation (IPPV), suctioning (e.g., oral or nasal), or changing the ventilator settings or modality can be provided at the direction of bedside intensivists in charge. The order of the procedures (i.e. NIOD or CPT) will be randomly allocated.\n\nMeasurements and Analyses: The primary outcome measure is the oxygenation level before and after the procedure (SpO2/FIO2 (SF) ratio). For the cases with Invasive ventilation and non-invasive ventilation, the investigators will also document expiratory tidal volume, vital signs, and any related complications such as vomiting, desaturations, or unexpected extubations. The investigators will collect the data before, 10 minutes after, and 30 minutes after the procedure.\n\nSample Size: The investigators estimate the necessary sample size as 25 for each arm (Total 50 cases), with a power of 0.90, alfa of 0.05, with the non-inferiority design.\n\nFUTURE CONSIDERATIONS This randomized pilot study will be considered a running phase if the investigators can/should undertake the RCT which should follow without significant modification of the methods.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nBACKGROUND During COVID-19 pandemic, although the proportion of severe or fatal cases may vary by location, 15-30% of hospitalized patients were admitted to the intensive care unit in Italy and China (1-4).\n\nPneumonia appears to be the most frequent serious manifestation of infection. In addition to respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms have also been reported (2, 3, 5). The symptomatic infection can range from mild to critical; but, generally, the clinical course seems to have characteristics of slow progression from upper airway to the lower and the other systemic organs such as cardiac muscles. Radiographic findings include ground-glass opacities, crazy paving appearance, air space consolidation, broncho-vascular thickening in the lesion with a slow progression up until 10-14 days from the onset of disease (6-8).\n\nStaff Shortage & Protection Protecting the workforce is another critical challenge. Sick leaves or self-isolation has increased already. Caring for infected patients represents a substantial exposure risk for ICU staffs because of high and prolonged exposure to critically ill patients who presumably have higher viral shedding. This should be particularly noted for physiotherapists to whom chest physiotherapy can be prescribed more often than usual in this situation of ICU demand. On the other hand, only a limited number of physiotherapists are available in most of ICUs.\n\nAirway obstruction due to the production of secretion particularly with respiratory muscle weakness in critically ill is a major problem in clinical management. CPT has been proposed to assist in the clearance of tracheobronchial secretions. Techniques such as the conventional CPT with chest percussion and vibration, chest shaking and directed coughing may help to mobilize secretions towards the trachea and trigger coughing that could help to remove the secretions. However, a recent systematic review reported that there is no sufficient evidence to provide CPT in routine practice with a significant heterogeneity of the procedure techniques used (9-13).\n\nExtra-thoracic non-invasive oscillating devices (NIOD) are designed to interrupt the expiratory airflow and can help to secretions clearance. NIOD requires less patient cooperation and could be used without interruptions such as due to coughing or suctioning of secretion. Frequencer® (Dymedso, Montreal Canada) is a NIOD that locally target the affected lung areas. The safety has been attested particularly in patients with cystic fibrosis. In addition, this NIOD can be easily administered by non-specialized personnel such as respiratory therapists or registered nurses (14, 15).\n\nThis proposed study is to compare the effectiveness of NIOD performed by non-specialized personnel (respiratory therapist, nurse, physicians) versus standard CPT performed by a physiotherapist.\n\nOBJECTIVES & RESEARCH QUESTIONS Objectives\n\nThis project has 3 specific objectives:\n\nTo study the feasibility and tolerance of NIOD in the mechanically ventilated patients\nTo study if NIOD performed by non-specialized personnel is not inferior to the standard CPT done by the physiotherapist in the care of COVID-19.\nTo study the impact of NIOD and CPT on oxygenation. Research questions to be asked\n\n1. Is the NIOD safe and well-tolerated to be applied to critically ill patients with COVID-19? 2. Is the NIOD not inferior to standard CPT performed by a physiotherapist with respect to the effect of oxygenation in critically ill COVID-19 patients? 3. What kinds of physiological positive effects can the NIOD and CPT provide on critically ill patients with COVID-19? 3. SIGNIFICANCE This study will provide valuable knowledge about secretion management in critically ill patients. It will also contribute to more efficient health care practice and resource utilization (i.e., physiotherapist).\n\nTo be specific, NIOD could improve the respiratory management of patients with COVID-19. The findings acquired in this study can be generalizable to other hospitals and cohorts in ICUs. Ultimately, this could reduce the impact of COVID-19 on the health system and could reduce the exposure of physiotherapists to COVID-19.\n\n4. METHODS 4.1 Study Design The investigators will adopt a prospective crossover non-inferiority randomized design.\n\n4.2 Setting Two ICUs in CHU Sainte Justine (Pediatric ICU) and Montreal General (Adult ICU) Hospital.\n\n4.3 Screening of Eligible Patients and Informed Consent Procedure. When there is a potentially eligible patient, a research assistant will be notified in 24/7 during the study period. The investigators will obtain the informed consent (IC) from patients or parents/guardians using an informed consent form.\n\n4.4 Eligible Patients Please see the other section of this application. 4.5 Intervention: Each subject will receive the NIOD (i.e., Frequencer) and the standardized CPT for this study.\n\n4.5.1 Suctioning and Other Interventions As per each ICU's protocol, the participants will have a suction of secretion as needed. Any other potential interventions such as nebulization of hypertonic saline and bronchodilator and that with a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) can be given without any restrictions.\n\n4.5.2 Positioning All the procedures (i.e., NIOD and CPT) will be applied with any positioning such as sitting and prone positions. Caregivers can also change the positioning as needed during the procedures. All the outcome parameters should be measured (before and after the procedures) with the same positioning.\n\n4.5.3 Detailed Procedure NIOD will be implemented on four different parts of the chest walls, 3 minutes for each part and 12 minutes in total per each session. Left and right front and posterior chest walls will be stimulated, particularly, on the anterior chest, intercostal spaces 1-2 above nipple line and lateral side of the mid-clavicular line 1-2 below intercostal spaces. The intensity of the NIOD can be selected between 80-100%, which is pre-specified on the machine. The step-by-step procedure is described in the Appendix.\n\n4.5.4 Selection of the Membrane There are several selections of the membrane available. The investigators will use the membrane according to the manual provided by the manufacture.\n\n4.5.5 Standardization of the Procedure. The procedure using the NIOD will be standardized. The investigators will use a video clip (i.e., YouTube) and will ask each caregiver to view at least once before the first procedure of the day.\n\n4.5.6 CPT. CPT will be defined as an assistant strike to the chest wall repeatedly with a cupped hand in specific places. CPT will be performed by a physiotherapist as per protocol in each institution.\n\n4.6 Detailed Protocol Patients satisfying the eligibility criteria will have their baseline data collected prior to the intervention.\n\nRandomization Participants will be randomized into one of the 2 arms (NIOD first or CPT first). In the existing studies targeting adults, 20-60Hz are most widely used (personal communication with Dymedso Inc.). The investigators will apply 40Hz. Randomization will be carried out by the independent research assistant in CHU Sainte Justine (CHUSJ). Random allocation will be generated by an independent investigator in an equal number assigned to each intervention. Stratification will be applied for age (>18 years or =<18 years of age) and sites (CHUSJ and General Hospital) (Figure2).\n\nTiming of the Data Measurement The data measured in mechanical ventilation and patients monitor will be collected 1) right before the intervention being initiated, 2) 10 minutes after the end of the intervention, and 3) 30 min after each intervention finished. The investigators will manually record the following variables for the three timings (4.9.1). Vital sign values including EtCO2 waveforms from the beginning of the intervention until 30 min after the intervention will be extracted from the Electronic Medical Records (i.e., every minute) for the cohorts in CHUSJ.\n\n4.7 Sample Size Calculation A trial aims to determine whether NIOD will be able to provide an improvement of oxygenation not inferior to standard CPT. The investigators estimate the mean improvement of SF ratio is 30 with a variance of 10 in CPT. It was claimed to be clinically non-inferior if effect of NIOD was 20% lower than the standard CPT. The largest clinically acceptable difference of 6 (30*0.20) is declared that NIOD is non-inferior compares with CPT. Type I, II error and ratio are set at 0.05, 0.1, and 1:1. With this, we require 32 cases in total (16 cases per group). Considering this, we will collect 25 cases per group (16-21).\n\n4.8 Protocol Violation. Protocol violation in eligibility is defined as when a patient was randomized but does not follow the protocol. These patients will be excluded from the analyses. Patients who withdraw their consent after randomization will be excluded from the analyses. The number of excluded patients after randomization will be displayed in the CONSORT flow diagram (Fig3). Patients assigned to both arm receive the standard ICU care in each center.\n\n4.9 Statistical Analyses The main analysis will be performed according to the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. A patient who withdrew consent or patients with a protocol violation concerning eligibility are excluded from ITT analyses. Differences in patient characteristics between patients lost to follow-up and included patients will be assessed. In view of the non-inferiority study design, per-protocol (PP) analyses will also be performed. All subjects from the ITT population without protocol violations and deviations regarding treatment will be included in the PP population. The investigators will also repeat the analyses with logistic regression to consider that randomization was stratified by the participating center and age (>18 or =<18 years of age). Non-inferiority will be established if the lower limit of the one-sided 95% confidence for the mean of SF ratio for CPT group relative to that of patients with NIOD exceeds the critical value corresponding to the absolute 5% margin below the observed proportion under usual care. All statistical analyses will be conducted with Stata (Stata Corp LP, TX USA) or other statistical software(s).\n\n5. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS 5.1 Overview The device and membrane for adults applied have been certified and approved by Health Canada and commercially available in Canada (Fig1a). Although the prototype transducer for infants (Fig1b) has not been tested on patients as a large trial, the mechanism of the pressure delivery and the intensity of the delivering pressure/ oscillation should be similar as compared to the existing model for children and adult patients. The devices have been approved by Health Canada. The investigators believe there should be no excessive harm as compared to the current standard CPT. Patients will also receive standard CPT during the study period, which is widely accepted as a practice for airway clearance in the ICUs.\n\nThis study will be approved by the Health Research Ethics Board of the University of Montreal, Canada. The study protocol will be registered into https://clinicaltrials.gov/ once it is approved by the local IRB.\n\n5.2 Risk Minimization and Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) It has shown that NIOD was feasible and well-tolerated in adult and relatively older children. For this study, another DSMB will be in place to independently supervise any potential side effects. It will include Francois Proulx MD and Tse Man Sze MD. The DSMB will follow the study completion and review any significant potential complications related to the intervention with NIOD. Any occurrence of pneumothorax, need for unplanned intubation, life-threatening event, during or in the 2 hours following the study, will be declared to and reviewed by the DSMB, which will independently decide on the need to stop or continue the study.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04361435","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

A Cluster Randomized Trial","abstract":"Brief summary:\nFollowing the announcement of the containment of the population due to the COVID-19 epidemic on March 17, 2020 in France, a notable decrease in the number of consultations in general practice was reported. Patients no longer contact their general practitioner, including those with regular follow-up for one or more chronic conditions. This observation raised worries since it could lead to delay or failure in detecting decompensations / complications of these chronic conditions by a lack of recourse to care. Thus, an urgent message from the National Health Department (Direction Générale de la Santé - DGS) was adressed on April 8, 2020 to the health professionals regarding the organization of care aside from COVID-19. The main recommendation was \"that the personal physician or the corresponding specialist should contact the most fragile patients with chronic condition to ensure follow-up and detect any risk of decompensation \".\n\nSuch fragile patients are in great numbers, up to more than 200 for an average general practitioner. Therefore, although this recommendation is regarded as \"essential in view of the health needs of the population\", it will prove quite difficult to follow without the help of a skilled external assistance that can be quickly mobilized.\n\nThe COVIQUEST project is a cluster randomized trial in general practice designed to assess the optimizationg of the screening and management of patients with chronic condition at risk of decompensation through a collaboration between the general practitioner and a medical student.\n\nThe trial will focus on patients wit cardiovascular conditions aged 70 or more and patients with mental health conditions. These conditions are both highly prevalent in general practice and both at risk of severe short-term complications.\n\nPractices will be randomly assigned to a group (A or B). In group A, students will start by contacting patients with cardiovascular conditions; in group B they will start by contacting patients patients with mentral health conditions. The students will call these patients on the phone and ask them specific questions about their health, their needs, and if they want their general practitioner to call them back. The student will then transmit this information to the general practitioner who will decide on the best care to offer the patient.\n\nThe primary outcome is defined as the occurrence of hospitalization during a one-month period after the phone call. It will be collected by a second phone call from the medical student. This time, all patients will be contacted, i.e. both patients with mental illness and cardiovascular patients, whatever the group. Thus, patients allocated to the control groups (i.e. patients with mental illness from group A and cardiovascular patients from group B) will also benefit from the intervention at 1 month: again, students will ask patients about their health and whether they want their general practitioner to call them back.\n\nThis approach has several advantages:\n\nall patients will benefit from a phone call, in accordance with the recommendations of the DGS,\nthe involvement of students, competent in medical interviews and quickly mobilizable, will help general practitioners, on the front line of many missions, without any health risk linked to the contagiousness of COVID-19 for students,\nrandomizing the call order will allow to assess with a high level of evidence the impact of such an organization on hospitalizations, for two families of diseases with high prevalence.\n\nThe trial will involve at least nine French regions. Considering that the general practitioner's patient base numbers an average of 110 patients with chronic cardiovascular disease or chronic mental illness, and that at least 25 general practitioners per region participate in the study, we can expect that 22,000 patients will benefit from the intervention of this study.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04359875","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Admission in the intensive care unit (ICU) and need for mechanical ventilation is reportedly associated with an estimated hospital mortality of more than 30%. Furthermore, the surge in ICU bed requirement is a worldwide-shared issue, leading to sub-optimal ICU management.\n\nIn acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19-related pneumonia, vasoplegia with vascular enlargement inside the lung lesions and dilation of small vessels seen on chest CT scan largely account for severe hypoxemia whose physiological response is hyperventilation leading to hypocapnia. Almitrine, initially described to reduce intrapulmonary shunt by enhancement of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in combination with inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), redistributes pulmonary blood flow from shunt areas to lung units with normal ventilation/perfusion (VA/Q) ratio. Low dose of intravenous almitrine (2 µg.kg-1.min-1) alone also improves oxygenation (without combination with iNO) by selective pulmonary vasoconstriction of precapillary pulmonary arteries perfusing lung areas exposed to a hypoxic challenge with a slight increase in mean arterial pulmonary. Therefore, our hypothesis is that 5 days of low dose of almitrine therapy may improve the ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) ratio at a relatively early stage of this specific lung disease and limit respiratory worsening and subsequent need for mechanical ventilation.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04357457","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

In the epidemic outbreak that exploded at the beginning of 2020 in the Lombardy Region, about two thirds of the patients who died from COVID-19 were affected by diabetes mellitus. COVID-19 occurs in 70% of cases with an inflammatory pathology of the airways that can be fed by a cytokine storm and result in severe respiratory failure (10% cases) and death (5%). The pathophysiological molecular mechanisms are currently not clearly defined. It is hypothesized that the transmembrane glycoprotein type II CD26, known for the enzyme activity Dipeptilpeptidase 4 of the extracellular domain, may play a main role in this condition. It is in fact considerably expressed at the level of parenchyma and pulmonary interstitium and carries out both systemic and paracrine enzymatic activity, modulating the function of various proinflammatory cytokines, growth factors and vasoactive peptides in the deep respiratory tract. Of particular interest is the fact that Dipeptilpeptidase 4 has been identified as a cellular receptor for S glycoprotein of MERS-COV. In the case of the SARS-COV 2 virus, the main receptor is the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 protein, but a possible interaction with Dipeptilpeptidase 4 also cannot be excluded. The selective blockade of Dipeptilpeptidase 4 could therefore favorably modulate the pulmonary inflammatory response in the subject affected by COVID-19. This protein is also known for the enzymatic degradation function of the native glucagon-like peptide 1, one of the main regulators of insulin secretion. This is why it is a molecular target in the treatment of diabetes (drugs that selectively inhibit Dipeptilpeptidase 4 are marketed with an indication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes). It is believed that the use of a Dipeptilpeptidase 4 inhibitor in people with diabetes and hospitalized for Covid-19 may be safe and of particular interest for an evaluation of the effects on laboratory and instrumental indicators of inflammatory lung disease. Among the drugs that selectively block Dipeptilpeptidase 4, the one with the greatest affinity is Sitagliptin.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nThe investigators propose a randomized controlled open label intervention study. Patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and affected by type 2 diabetes mellitus will be included in the study and divided into two groups by randomization: sitagliptin add-on standard of care therapy with nutritional therapy with or without insulin treatment (study group) vs nutritional therapy with or without insulin treatment (group of control, standard therapy). The design of the study provides an open randomization to allow its feasibility in times compatible with the achievement of adequate cases during the epidemic. The presence of placebo and a double-blind study, would lead to longer planning and enrollment times.\n\nPatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus hospitalized for COVID-19 and randomized to the study group will be treated with sitagliptin at an adjusted dosage for estimated glomerular filtrate: 100 mg once daily (estimated glomerular filtration rate less than or equal to 45 mL / min / 1.73 m2) or 50 mg (estimated glomerular filtration rate 30-45 mL / min / 1.73 m2) in combination or not with insulin treatment. Patients with stage IV and V renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate less than or equal to 30 mL / min / 1.73 m2) will be excluded. Enrolled patients will be followed according to the following scheme:\n\nTime points:\n\nT0: The doctor explains the protocol to the patient and he gives to him the informed consent and the letter to the general practitioner.\nT1: The patient gives the signed and dated consent and officially enters the study. Basic assessments will be made. At the baseline, the clinical response, the main laboratory and instrumental tests will be taken into consideration. Biological samples will be taken for immunological study. Diabetic patients will begin treatment with Sitagliptin 100 or 50 mg add-on to nutritional therapy and, eventually, insulin treatment. Any other hypoglycemic agents taken before admission will be suspended.\nT2: 7 days after T1, for both groups of patients, evaluation of the clinical response, of the average daily blood glucose levels, of the main laboratory and instrumental tests.\nT3: 10 days after T2, for both groups of patients, evaluation of clinical response, average daily blood glucose levels, of the main laboratory and instrumental tests. Collection of biological samples for immunological study.

Recent case series reported the use of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) on 5 severe COVID-19 patients who developed respiratory insufficiency. HBOT mechanisms of tissue oxygenation and anti-inflammatory effect may explain these findings.\n\nThe purpose of the current study is the evaluate the efficacy of HBOT in moderate-severe COVID-19 patients in a randomized controlled manner.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nThe 2019-20 coronavirus disease, caused by COVID-19, is an ongoing pandemic. The outbreak started in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December 2019 and the World Health Organization (WHO) recognized it as a pandemic on 11 March 2020. Up to Apr 9. 2020 there are more than 2 million confirmed cases, and over 140,000 deaths. In Israel, COVID-19 was confirmed in more 12,000 cases and took the life of 140 victims. There are 323 mild admitted cases, 170 moderate admitted cases and 170 severe admitted cases (16.04.2020) .\n\nEven though the general mortality rate is low (0.2-7%, country based), patients who develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) have a significantly higher mortality rate, up to 61-90%. COVID-19 ARDS is different, causing a rapidly progressive disease including respiratory insufficiency and pulmonary fibrosis. The mechanism behind isn't clear yet, but evidence points to the direction of an acute cytokines storm which include: IL-2, IL-7, GCSF, InterferonGamma, TNF-alpha, Macrophage chemoattractant protein . Poor prognosis include high levels of IL-6 and Ferritin.\n\nMore than 160 clinical trials have been registered, but as of April 2020, there is no proven effective treatment.\n\nThe use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) includes breathing 100% oxygen in pressures higher than 1 absolute atmospheres (ATA), increasing the amount of oxygen dissolved in the plasma and the different tissues. In the last month, Chen et al. reported a case series of 5 severe COVID-19 patients treated with 3-8 HBOT sessions in addition to the standard therapy. In all cases, they reported an increase in oxygen saturation, arterial oxygen content,lactate levels reduction,fibrinogen levels decrease and increase in lymphocytes number.In addition, the patients chest CT showed improved signs. Symptomatic relief started following the 2nd session. No significant adverse events were reported.\n\nThese findings may be explained by the known physiological effects of HBOT, related to the SARS-CoV-2 virus pathogenesis:\n\nIncreased competitive binding of oxygen to the hemoglobin molecule - it has been postulated recently the SARS-CoV-2 bind to the heme component in the hemoglobin molecule and reduces the oxygen affinity to hemoglobin. During HBOT, the increased amount of available oxygen molecules increases the binding to the hemoglobin molecules. This has shown significant beneficial effects in cases of another competitive molecule such as carbon monoxide intoxication.\nTissue oxygenation - The oxygen content in the different tissues is multiplied by 25-30 times. This effect has two therapeutic aspects: First, overcoming pulmonary hypoxia (either shunt or VQ mismatch) by increasing the FiO2 significantly. By increasing the pulmonary oxygen gradient, oxygen diffusion increases and can overcome the inflammation in the alveoli and the thickened fibrosis caused by ARDS. Second, during HBOT, the amount of oxygen dissolved in the plasma becomes significant and enables tissue oxygenation without the need of red blood cells.\nAnti inflammatory - HBOT reduces the following inflammatory cytokines both in the protein level and genes expression (mRNA): IL-2, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta. The anti-inflammatory effect has been shown in chronic diseases as well as models of acute infection and massive hemorrhage.\n\nThe purpose of the current study is the evaluate the efficacy of HBOT in moderate-severe COVID-19 patients in a randomized controlled manner.\n\nProtocol Following signing an informed consent, the patients will be randomized 2:1 to hyperbaric oxygen therapy group and normobaric oxygen therapy grou. Following the randomization the patients will undergo evaluation including symptoms, vitals, pulmonary function, blood tests.\n\nThe patients will undergo 8 sessions of either hyperbaric/normobaric oxygen therapy, 2 sessions per day, in 4 consecutive days.During the sessions, the symptoms and vitals will be monitored. 1 day and 1 week following the last session, revaluation will be performed.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04358926","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

To this we will gain knowledge of how humans develops immunity to the virus and also how human epigenetic (acquired) ability to activate inflammatory genetic systems can limit the harmful effects of the virus. Thus, patients who have had mild or no symptoms are just as interesting from a study point of view as those who have had severe symptoms.

When learners participate in an online learning course at different times, it is known as asynchronous learning. online learning involves the umbrella term for any learning that takes place across distance and not in a traditional classroom.\n\nThe reason for much of the growth in distance education programs in recent years is the development of the Internet and the improvement of technologies that support online learning environments. Despite the rapid growth in its use, there is considerable concern about accurately assess the quality and effectiveness of (ODL). Numerous studies comparing traditional classroom-based instruction with technology-supported instruction have found no significant differences in critical educational variables such as learning outcomes and student satisfaction.\n\nStudents prefer certain methods of learning more than others. These traits, referred to as learning styles, form a student's unique learning preference, and aid teachers in the planning of small-group and individualized instruction. If optimal student learning is dependent on learning styles, and these styles vary between distance and equivalent on-campus students, then faculty should be aware of these differences and alter their preparation and instructional methods accordingly. Knowledge of student learning preferences can aid faculty in-class preparation, designing class delivery methods, choosing appropriate technologies, and developing sensitivity to differing student learning preferences within the distance education environment. Many communication skills required of the (ODL) instructor are similar to those needed for effective classroom teaching. On the other hand, the online instructor's role does require a paradigm shift regarding instructional time and space, virtual management techniques, and the ability to engage students through virtual communication.\n\nWHO recommends Implement social distancing practices that may include; Staggering the beginning and end of the school day and Use of online/e-learning strategies? The coronavirus pandemic has changed how millions around the globe are educated. new shifts in education approaches could widen equality gaps. As of March 13, the Organization for Economic Co-operation estimated that over 421 million students are affected due to school closures announced or implemented in 39 countries. Besides, another 22 countries have announced partial \"localized\" closures. These risk-control decisions have led millions of students into temporary 'home-schooling' situations, these changes have certainly caused a degree of inconvenience, but they have also prompted new examples of educational innovation. To help slow the virus' spread, Academic 2.7 Million students in Egypt started to learning at home, in February 2020, via interactive apps, and other faculties got further simpler asynchronous online learning tools (such as reading material via Google Classroom, ZOOM, sending lessons and assignments via the official website, WhatsApp or email) augmented with synchronous face-to-face video instruction, to help preempt school closures.\n\nMost faculties in affected areas are finding stop-gap solutions to continue teaching, but the quality of learning is heavily dependent on the level and quality of digital access. Moreover, the less affluent, digitally understanding, and low socioeconomic are factors affecting the student's achievement. For anyone who has taught face-to-face classes, making the transition to fully online may feel completely overwhelming. Course writers and instructors alike might find themselves asking questions such as, \"How will I translate my classroom materials—activities or laboratory experiences—in a way that will benefit the online student? How will I generate discussion and engagement between students? Assessment of students' perception toward provided learning methods was growing in recent years because the best way of confirming quality in academic education is obtaining feedback from undergraduates. Many studies were examined students' perception as a solo dimensional scale, such as self efﬁcacy, behavioral response, or affective response. While, in the current study the researcher prefers to utilize a comprehensive, widely used, valid, reliable, and multi-dimensional tool additionally avoid too-much items to prevent responds fatigue. And can approach either by Face to face interview or by online method. Students' learning perception questionnaire (SLPQ), will be utilized in the current study to measure the dependent variable, (SLPQ) was adopted inventory and metric instrument to assess the effectiveness of provided learning methods as perceived by the students. It has been developed over several years based on wide statistical analysis in addition to student and expert interviews in different countries. It covers two inventories; students' perceptions of the teaching-learning environment (TLE) (22 items) and students' approaches to learning (SAL) (12 items).\n\nAlthough the implementation of Online Distance Learning will be established as a result of (COVID-19) social distancing measures suddenly without any plan of action, one question remains a need for the answer; how prepared students are for successful Online Distance Learning? whatever the answer may be, the new method of e-learning will be administrated for the student. The researcher believes that address the preparedness and rate the important competencies required by students for effective Distance Learning performance of the student is the first and important step. Although a number of the online learning readiness scales have been developed to assess the readiness of students to be online learners, very few of these scales provide an assessment concerning the knowledge, skills, and attitudes students might require as online learners. In many of the preparedness scales, there is the tendency to describe what students have to be (e.g., self-directed, self-aware) rather than what students need to do. In 2000, McVay developed a Readiness for Online Learning questionnaire that used attitudes and behaviors as predictors of online student learning readiness. McVay's Readiness for Online Learning questionnaire remains a popular instrument for measuring student readiness for e-learning environments. Several subsequent studies have since explored the utility and reliability of this instrument across a range of different contexts. A modified previous e-learning readiness scale developed by Watkins (2003). This earlier scale originally had 40 items which, based upon the results of Confirmatory Factor Analysis, Watkins et al. (2004) were able to reduce to a 27 items scale. Six dimensions were identified: Technology Access, Online Skills, and Relationships, Motivation, Online Audio/Video, Internet Discussions, and Importance to your success.\n\nTherefore, the current study aimed to assess Nursing students' perception and achievement regarding unplanned shifting the Traditional Classroom-Based to Online Distance Learning as a result of (COVID-19) social distancing measures:\n\nTheoretical framework Teachers must examine students' traditional perspectives and adopt a comprehensive perspective framework of learning environments that is appropriate for online teaching. Specific aspects of adult learning theory guided the development of the pedagogical model that was used to develop the online learning environment. Johnson, 1997 suggests a combination philosophy of learning theories rather than be confined to one preferred perspective such as; behavioral, Cognitive, and social learning theories. Quality online learning environments should be made up of elements of behavioral learning theory e.g. using positive reinforcement and repetition. Cognitive learning theory (for example, addressing Multiple senses, presenting new information in motivating ways, limiting the amount of information presented, and connecting new information to prior knowledge), and social learning theory (for example, encouraging group interaction, peer assessment, and personal feedback). These three theories were synthesized into integrated seven general principles that appear to be crucial for online learning environments. The current study adopting that the powerful online learning environments need to contain a combination of these principles: (1) address individual difference, (2) motivate the student, (3) avoid information overload, (4) create A real-life context, (5) encourage social interaction, (6) provide hands-on activities, and (7) encourage student reflection. These principles for online instruction will be attempted to apply all as a framework while facing the challenge of dramatical, situational, and unplanned application.\n\nAn Instructional Strategy Framework for Online Learning Environments\n\nResearch Hypothesis H1: Learning perception is lower for nursing students who learned by unplanned Online Distance Learning (μ1) than for those who learned by Traditional Classroom-Based learning (μ2), (H1: μ1 < μ2).\n\nH1: Scholar achievement is grater for nursing students who learned by Traditional Classroom-Based learning (μ1) than for those who learned by unplanned Online Distance Learning (μ2), (H1: μ1 > μ2).\n\nSubjects and Methods\n\nResearch Design:\n\nA quasi-experimental research design will be utilized in the current study with a comparative approach. The study will conduct a prospective unplanned Online Distance Learning for nursing students as a result of (COVID-19) social distancing measures as compared to the students who learned the same courses in the last finished semester by the Traditional Classroom-Based learning. Both study and control groups will be tested for students' perception and scholar achievement as a dependent effect. However, subjects of the current study will not randomly be assigned to either the experimental or the comparison group.\n\nParticipant:\n\nA convenience sample of adult male and female bachelor's students of nursing will be asked to participate in the current study. the participant students will be divided into study and control groups. Students who are currently studying Spring Semester (Official started in 2020 February 1 to May 30) will be selected as a study group. While the control group was retrospectively selected, the students who studied the same courses in the autumn semester (started in 2019 September 21 to 2020 January 9). 1200 full-time students are enrolled in the college of nursing. Full-time status for each semester must have a minimum of 12 credit hours. Each credit hour corresponds to a minimum of 2 hours of student engagement per week for a traditional 15-week course. The college encompasses four levels covered by nine departments, around 300 students at each level. The five encompasses courses are (Nursing Research, Nursing Informatics, Clinical Pediatric Nursing, Pharmacology, and health assessment). The sample size should be not less than 180 participant, estimated by (G Power analysis) (independent t-tests - One tail, Effect size = 0.5, α = 0.05, Power (1-β) = 0.95, balanced allocation ratio 1:1). All students should have corresponded to the following inclusion criteria:\n\nWilling to participate in this study.\nNone of the participants had previously taken the online-based course.\nThe same educational background.\nPassed all pre-request courses.\nFull-time enrolment\nThe age of 18 years old or more.\n\nInstruments of Data Collection:\n\nThree tools will be framed to collect data relevant to the current study.\n\nA brief demographic self-administrated questionnaire was constructed to collect information on aspects such as the participant's gender, age group and enrollment level in addition to students' GPA, it will be collected from the student affairs of the college to measure the students' scholar achievement as a dependent variable.\nStudents' Learning Perception Questionnaire (SLPQ), will be utilized in the current study to measure the dependent variable, (SLPQ) was adopted, self-administrated, inventory and metric instrument to assess the effectiveness of provided learning methods as perceived by the students. It covers two inventories; students' perceptions of the teaching-learning environment (TLE) (22 items) and students' approaches to learning (SAL) (12 items). Six factors emerged from the 22 items measuring different aspects of the teaching-learning environment (TLE): (Teaching for understanding, Alignment, Staff enthusiasm, and support, Interest and relevance, Constructive feedback, and Support from other students). While, students' approaches to learning (SAL) measure three broad approaches to learning: deep approach to learning, surface approach to learning, and organized studying, each with four items. (SLPQ) Items will be scored on a five-point Likert scale (\"Totally disagree (1)\" to \"Totally agree (5)\"). The utilized instrument will be tested for reliability and internal validity. The instrument will be provided as its original language of English because the students learned and examined all courses in the English language. Arabic translation will be available to students if they faced difﬁculty in understanding any statement. Data will be collected from participants through an electronic questionnaire online using email (for control and experimental group).\nModified McVay's Readiness for Online Learning Questionnaire. Watkins et al. (2004) developed a 27 items scale that used attitudes and behaviors of the participants as predictors of students' preparedness for online learning and e-learning environments. This self-administrated instrument was identified six dimensions: Technology Access (3 items), Online Skills and Relationships (9 items), Motivation (3 items), Online Audio/Video (3 items), Internet Discussions (4 items) and Importance to your success (5 items). The instrument consisted of a 5-point Likert-type scale response format (1- Completely Disagree, 2-Strongly Disagree, 3- Not Sure, 4-Strongly Agree, 5-Completely Agree).\n\nEthical Consideration:\n\nParticipation in the study is voluntary; each participant has the right to withdraw from the study when he or she wants. Informed consent will be obtained from the participants. Confidentiality and anonymity of the subjects are assured through coding of all data. Collected data will be used for the research purpose only and will not be reused in another research. All information taken will be protected and will not affect students' annual appraisal by any means. The formulated database and the result of the current study will be incorporating into the plan of education in the college.\n\nProcedure:\n\nOnce the official permission and ethical approval are granted to proceed to the proposed study, the implementation will be applied in two parts:\n\nst Part will be initiated by reviewing all students' files who are studying the selected courses in currently Spring Semester, and the recently completed autumn semester. The contact information of the students who will correspond to the inclusion criteria will be obtained. Then, they will be invited by sent phone messages to participating in the current study. The student who willing to participate in this study will be divided into paired study and control groups. the students who are currently studying in the Spring Semester will be operated as a study group, also the students who are previously completed autumn semester will be manipulated retrospectively as a control group. The excepted number of participants not less than 180 students. The purpose, nature, and benefits of the study will be explained to the participants. A pilot study will be conducted on 10% = 18 students to estimate the needed time for data collection, and to test the feasibility, objectivity, and clarity of the study instruments. All queries of students regarding the meaning of the statements and how to ﬁll in the answers will be discussed via WhatsApp and addressed before the actual study will start.\nnd Part will be started by sending (instrument 1, 2) to the control group (students who were learned by Traditional Classroom-Based Learning) via emails to fill out. These collected data will be considered as baseline data pertinent to the current study. About the study group (students who are currently learning by online distance way) they will be asked at the beginning of the current semester to fill out (instrument 1, 3) that will be as soon when the unplanned online distance learning was started (1st week of February) to assess the students' demographic data and preparedness for online learning. Then, the following actions will be implemented while online learning is processing; (1) Address and consider the students' differences in online learning application as a new experience. Provide Content in Multiple Formats. use of various communication technologies. Apply lectures are audio streamed and synchronized with the applicable PowerPoint presentation. lectures are also transcribed and posted on the course Web site. Utilize links to outside Web sites that provide supplemental material on the current topic.\n\n(2) Allow for Individual Locus of Control. Access the content through links or a graphical organizer. access to organize the course material as students need. students may even move through the course topics in random order.\n\nEncourage active and collaborative interaction. In light of the idea that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, each course is designed with activities that are both individual- and group-based.\n\n(3) Motivate the student:\n\nMaintain students' attention by providing an environment that is engaging and participative. Make the students feel that the course material is relevant. Incorporate Games into the Online Environment. Use Multimedia When Appropriate.\n\n(4) Avoid information overload,\n\nLimit the Amount of Content and Number of Activities. Organize Instruction Around Learning Cycles. Provide a Graphic Organizer for the Course.\n\n(5) Create A real-life context,\n\nCreate Virtual Learning Teams. Simulate Reality Using Appropriate Case Studies. Require Collaborative Projects (6) Encourage social interaction,\nCreate a Personal Connection with Students. Peer Review and Feedback. Facilitate Interaction (7) Provide hands-on activities,\n\nOrganize Online Courses Around Projects. Think-Pair-Share in a Virtual Environment. Use Small-Group Discussions During Synchronous Sessions.\n\n(8) Encourage student reflection.\n\nProvide Extensive and Timely Feedback and encourage online Diaries or Reflective Journals.\n\nAt the end of the current semester, the students of the study group will be asked to complete an electronic questionnaire online (instrument 2). Also, the GPA of all participants in the study and control group will be collected from the student affairs. Finally, the researcher will compare the data of the study dependent variables to the collected baseline data (control group).\n\nData Analysis Upon completion of data collection, descriptive and inferential statistics will be utilized to test for differences among the study and control group subjects, using the SPSS program.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04372693","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Sleep disruption and sleep alteration may have an influence on the ability to breathe spontaneously. But, the cause of altered sleep remains unknown. Previous studies have shown that decreasing nocturnal respiratory muscle activity through mechanical ventilation might improve sleep quality. Nocturnal respiratory muscle activity may be one of the potential factor which contribute to alter sleep in the ICU. Therefore, the aim of this study is to analyse the presence of NIM activation during the night and it's consequence in an ICU population with the same pathology (COVID 19 ARDS).\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nSleep alteration is a common problem among ventilated ICU patient. About one third of the patient have abnormal EEG pattern which cannot be scored by using the AASM standard criteria. Patients experience marked fragmentation, absence of deep sleep, and REM sleep is decreased, . It has been shown that sleep deprivation has a negative impact on respiratory muscle endurance. So a good sleep is essential when the respiratory system is being challenged, as in the ICU during the weaning period. Indeed, in the ICU, patients with altered sleep, had a markedly longer weaning duration than in patients with normal sleep, and are more likely to fail a spontaneous breathing trial. Many factors may influence the quality of sleep in the ICU (noise, medication, mechanical ventilation …) but few studies have focus on the cause of this altered sleep, and the cause of altered sleep remains unknown. Previous studies have shown that decreasing nocturnal respiratory muscle activity through mechanical ventilation might improve sleep quality. Mechanical ventilation can decrease the charge imposed on the respiratory pump, and allows muscle to rest. Indeed, when the charge is too high (for example after an ARDS during the weaning period), the diaphragm may be overloaded, and there could be a greater involvement of other inspiratory muscles in breathing. In other pathological condition, the neck inspiratory muscle activity is increased (e.g. COPD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), and sometimes this activity persist during sleep with marked degradation in sleep architecture. Nocturnal respiratory muscle activity may be one of the potential factor which contribute to alter sleep in the ICU. Ttherefore, the aim of tis study is to analyse the presence of NIM activation during the night and it's consequence in an ICU population with the same pathology (COVID 19 ARDS).","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04371029","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Here we show that the B38-CAP, a carboxypeptidase derived from Paenibacillus sp. B38, is an ACE2-like enzyme to decrease angiotensin II levels in mice. In protein 3D structure analysis, B38-CAP homolog shares structural similarity to mammalian ACE2 with low sequence identity. In vitro, recombinant B38-CAP protein catalyzed the conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7, as well as other known ACE2 target peptides. Treatment with B38-CAP suppressed angiotensin II-induced hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and fibrosis in mice. Moreover, B38-CAP inhibited pressure overload-induced pathological hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis, and cardiac dysfunction in mice. Our data identify the bacterial B38-CAP as an ACE2-like carboxypeptidase, indicating that evolution has shaped a bacterial carboxypeptidase to a human ACE2-like enzyme. Bacterial engineering could be utilized to design improved protein drugs for hypertension and heart failure.On the contraryTreatment with recombinant human ACE2 protein (rhACE2), which is devoid of its membrane-anchored domain thus soluble, has been demonstrated to exhibit beneficial effects in various animal models including heart failure, acute lung injury, and diabetic nephropathy, and so forth. rhACE2 is currently tested in the clinic to treat ARDS and COVID-19 infected patients . Using cell cultures and organoids, researchers from the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden and the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Canada, showed that by adding a genetically modified variant of ACE2, called human recombinant soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hrsACE2), COVID-19 was prevented from entering cells.The paper, published in Cell, shows that hrsACE2 had a dose dependent effect of viral growth of SARS-CoV-2 and was able to reduce it by a factor of 1,000 to 5,000 in cell cultures. Despite its beneficial effects, rhACE2 is a glycosylated protein and thus its preparation requires time- and cost-consuming protein expression system with mammalian or insect cells, which may not be advantageous in drug development and medical economy Although it had been reported that an immune response is associated with the chronic infusion of rhACE2 resulting in the degradation of rhACE226, this was not observed for B38-CAP; there were no antibodies against B38-CAP detectable in the serum of mice infused with B38-CAP for 2 weeks. Implantation of B38-CAP-filled osmotic mini-pumps significantly suppressed Ang II-induced hypertension in conscious mice .without affecting the heart rate. These results indicate that B38-CAP antagonizes the vasopressor effect of Ang II. So the principle investigator expects and suggests that treating with cloned Bacterial ACE2 receptors -like enzyme of B38-CAP could be promising COVID-19 infection- and lung injury preventing drug better than recombinant human ACE2 in addition to brsACE2, expected to lure the virus to attach itself to the copy instead of the actual cells… It distracts the virus from infecting the cells to the same degree and should lead to a reduction in the growth of the virus in the lungs and other organs. A study showed that recombinant B38-CAP protein downregulates Ang II levels in mice and antagonizes Ang II-induced hypertension, pathological cardiac hypertrophy, and myocardial fibrosis. We also show beneficial effects of B38-CAP on the pathology of pressure overload-induced heart failure in mice without overt toxicities.\n\nKeywords: COVID 2019 ,Infection, B38-CAP , Bacterial ACE2 receptors -like enzyme , rhACE226.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThis is an open label, randomized, controlled, pilot clinical study in patients with COVID-19, to obtain preliminary biologic, physiologic, and clinical data in patients with COVID-19 treated with rbACE2 or control patients, to help determine whether a subsequent Phase 2B trial is warranted.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nRecombinant Bacterial ACE2 receptors -like enzyme of B38-CAP could be promising COVID-19 infection- and lung injury preventing drug better than recombinant human ACE2\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nWhile the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is spreading across the world, infecting more than one million people, the fact that no specific drug or vaccine exists against any of the coronaviruses including the SARS, MERS and the novel coronavirus is creating fear among the people. world's COVID-19 count rises sharply day by day (active cases count more than one million people . Hydroxychloroquine is the only ray of hope now-a-days, along with different vaccine trials and passive immunisation therapy using 'convalescent plasma', target-specific drug discovery is of paramount importance right now.It has been well-known that SARS-CoV-2 appears to be optimized for binding to the human receptor ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). The spike (S) glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV binds ACE2 with higher affinity than SARS-CoV S. Wrapp et al., (2020) also tested several published SARS-CoV RBD (receptor binding domain)-specific monoclonal antibodies and found that they do not have appreciable binding to 2019-nCoV S. ACE2 is expressed in a variety of different tissues including both the upper and lower respiratory tract, myocardium and the gastrointestinal mucosa.\n\nhrsACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 infection:-\n\nThe researchers used blood vessel and kidney organoids to demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect and multiply within these tissues, a possible cause of the multi-organ failures and cardiovascular damage seen in severe COVID-19 cases. The addition of hrsACE2 also reduced the SARS-CoV-2 infection in these organoids. the paper, published in Cell, shows that hrsACE2 had a dose dependent effect of viral growth of SARS-CoV-2 and was able to reduce it by a factor of 1,000 to 5,000 in cell cultures.\n\nSaid Ali Mirazimi, adjunct professor at the Department of Laboratory Medicine at Karolinska Institutet and one of the study's corresponding authors. \"We believe adding this enzyme copy, hrsACE2, lures the virus to attach itself to the copy instead of the actual cells… It distracts the virus from infecting the cells to the same degree and should lead to a reduction in the growth of the virus in the lungs and other organs.\" But treating with according to Bacterial ACE2 receptors -like enzyme of B38-CAP could be promising COVID-19 infection- and lung injury preventing drug better than recombinant human ACE2 as rhACE2 is a glycosylated protein and thus its preparation requires time- and cost-consuming protein expression system with mammalian or insect cells, which may not be advantageous in drug development and medical economy Although it had been reported that an immune response is associated with the chronic infusion of rhACE2 resulting in the degradation of rhACE226, this was not observed for B38-CAP; there were no antibodies against B38-CAP detectable in the serum of mice infused with B38-CAP for 2 weeks.

These results indicate that B38-CAP antagonizes the vasopressor effect of Ang II. So the principle investigator expects and suggests that treating with Recombinant Bacterial ACE2 receptors -like enzyme of B38-CAP could be promising COVID-19 infection- and lung injury preventing drug better than recombinant human ACE2 in addition to brsACE2, expected to lure the virus to attach itself to the copy instead of the actual cells… It distracts the virus from infecting the cells to the same degree and should lead to a reduction in the growth of the virus in the lungs and other organs.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThis is a small pilot study investigating whether there is any efficacy signal that warrants a larger Phase 2B trial, or any harm that suggests that such a trial should not be done.

No specific pharmacologic therapy has proven efficacy to treat ARDS. Corticosteroids have been investigated as a treatment for ARDS with conflicting results. Two sub phenotypes of ARDS have been described. One is hypo-inflammatory, associated with lower levels of circulating cytokines and therefore greater ventilator free days and a lower mortality. The second sub-phenotype is hyper-inflammatory with elevated cytokine levels, elevated acute phase reactants such as ferritin and c-reactive protein (CRP).\n\nMany patients infected with the novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of CVOID-19, present with an exaggerated inflammatory response which leads to the hyper-inflammatory sub-phenotype of ARDS. These patients may derive great benefit from corticosteroids. Accordingly,this study will determine the safety and estimate efficacy of targeted corticosteroids in mechanically ventilated patients with the hyper-inflammatory sub phenotype of ARDS due to COVID-19\n\nHypothesis: Early administration of dexamethasone to patients with the hyper-inflammatory sub-phenotype of ARDS due to COVID-19 pneumonia is a safe intervention which increases ventilator free days\n\nApproach: This is a single-center, phase 2a, pragmatic, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study accessing the safety and efficacy of dexamethasone for mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 infection.

Patients who present with an ARDS sub-type characterized by exaggerated inflammation may particularly benefit from this intervention. Corticosteroids may represent a simple and safe treatment for patients with the most severe form of COVID-19 infection and has the potential to save thousands of lives.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04360876","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Clinical manifestations vary widely from one individual to another, from asymptomatic carrier to a febrile cough that can rapidly lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic, screening by chest X-ray (RT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) SARS-CoV-2 conducted by the Cornwall Hospital Union laboratory has shown that among symptomatic patients and hospital staff suspected of being COVID-19, only 7.8% were attributable to COVID-19. Two nosocomial clusters were also identified, in the emergency department (10 carers) and in the cardiology department (6 carers and one patient). However, direct diagnosis by RT-PCR has sensitivity limits and can lead to false negative results when the subject is indeed suffering from COVID-19. This lack of sensitivity is inherent to the technique on the one hand, but also to the quality of the sample and the kinetics of the infection. Indeed, the virological window during which the virus is present in the respiratory mucous membranes sampled seems relatively narrow, hence a progressive negativation of the respiratory samples as the disease progresses. Moreover, clinical symptoms vary from one individual to another, and it is now recognized that some infected persons are asymptomatic but carry the virus. Thus, the use of a second diagnostic technique is a necessity, and serology could be a relevant diagnostic support.\n\nIn the literature, several publications report the performance of COVID-19 serology in clusters of cases or cohorts of subjects. The serological techniques employed are variable (target epitopes in particular) and frequently homemade. Serology is mainly studied in comparison or association with RT-PCR in order to highlight the increased performance of COVID-19 diagnosis when the two techniques are combined. Correlation with chest CT imaging data is also encountered.\n\nNumerous serological tests are therefore being tested to determine retrospectively whether the individual has been exposed to the virus by looking for specific antibodies to the virus. The supreme health authority has drawn up specifications dated 16 April 2020, defining the methods for evaluating the performance of serological tests detecting antibodies directed against SARSCoV-2 in order to provide a framework for these practices. Several clinical studies are also underway, in particular to assess the kinetics of the appearance of the antibodies, whether these specific antibodies would be protective and whether their appearance would coincide with a cessation of contagiousness. Thus, the main objective of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the COVID-19 immunoglobulin (IgG) Dia-Pro serological test, in view of its deployment at the Cornish Hospital Union Laboratory. Subsequently, given the low prevalence of COVID-19 in Brittany and the risk of a second epidemic wave when the confinement is lifted, the evaluation of the seroprevalence of the staff of the Cornish Hospital Union is necessary in order to assess the attack rate of COVID-19 within the establishment and particularly within departments where nosocomial clusters have been reported; and to prevent the impact of deconfinement. Indeed, knowledge of the proportion of immunized personnel and its distribution according to services will make it possible to establish internal recommendations and to effectively manage personal protective equipment inventories, in conjunction with the deconfinement strategy that will be implemented by the government. The goal is to protect hospital staff from overexposure to the virus;","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04363593","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

In the Dutch treatment protocol guideline (SWAB) designated treatment is supportive care with the option to add chloroquine base (CQ) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). CQ and HCQ are implemented because of their in vitro activity, results from small animal studies, and anecdotal patient's data. There are no published randomized studies with these medications in patients with disease caused by any coronavirus.\n\nObjective: To evaluate if treatment with only supportive care or addition of one of two anti-COVID_19 agents (chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine) results in less disease progression in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 who require hospital admission.\n\nStudy design: Multicentre, cluster randomized cross-over, open label trial. Hospitals will be randomly allocated to one of 3 treatment arms in sequential periods of one week: chloroquine base versus hydroxychloroquine versus supportive care without any drug presumed active against SARS-COV-2. Patients will be treated based on the date of inclusion.\n\nStudy population: Adults aged of 18 years and older with moderate to severe, with a NEWS-2 score ≤ 5, laboratory confirmed COVID-19, who require hospital admission in a ward outside the Medium Care or Intensive Care.\n\nIntervention (if applicable): Depending on the treatment arm, the study subject will receive only supportive care or an addition with one of the two agents active against SARS-CoV-2 (chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine).\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints: Disease progression defined as a NEWS-2 score ≥ 7 within 14 days, or admission to Medium Care or Intensive Care Unit, or death.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nStudy rationale CQ and HCQ were both employed in the treatment of COVID-19 in China. Based on unpublished anecdotal positive results in China, CQ is now implemented in China and the Netherlands in severe COVID-19. HCQ is an analog of CQ with more anti-viral effectivity ex vivo, better safety and tolerability profile.\n\nRationale for the employment of CQ and HCQ in China comes from the fact that both reduce COVID-19 replication ex-vivo. On top of this, both drugs have clear immunomodulating effects (which is used for various indications to treat rheumatologic diseases) and have shown promising results in patients with dengue and HIV.\n\nCurrently, in the Dutch guidelines, for moderate severely ill patients CQ base is the first line of therapy for patients admitted in hospital with moderate to severe COVID-19.\n\nThe time needed to \"load\" the body when using CQ and thus the possible late onset of action suggests that initiation of treatment should be timely. Moreover, the hypothesized mode of action suggests that both HCQ and CQ inhibit cellular replication of COVID-19 but do not have an intrinsic effect on the virus, thus could be best employed when the viral load is low (i.e. early phase of the disease) and thus safe time to improve the subsequent immune response. This underlines that both drugs should be implemented early rather than late in the course of SARS-COV-2 infection.\n\nThe investigators propose a cluster randomized controlled study evaluating the value of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine compared to no antiviral therapy in admitted patients with moderate to severe COVID-19.\n\nStudy design:\n\nPopulation Adult patients with confirmed COVID-19, with moderate to severe symptoms and admitted to the hospital and a NEWS-2 score ≤ 5, will be available for the study.\n\nIntervention\n\nAll three treatment arms contain standard supportive care during hospital admission with in two arms an addition with either chloroquine (CQ) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) Despite the inclusion of CQ and HCQ as possible additional treatment for COVID-19 in the Dutch treatment guideline, there's no conclusion on the best treatment strategy in this population. Based on pharmacokinetic modelling, and the safety profile, HCQ seems to be more promising than CQ, but both drugs have to be studied in relation to COVID-19. Furthermore, the availability of both drugs might differ from country to country; in the Netherlands for instance, chloroquine is widely available. Therefore, a 1:1:1 trial including standard supportive care with in addition CQ or HCQ as suggested in the LCI/SWAB guideline, the optimal dosages in the different treatment arms are as follows:\n\nSupportive care + chloroquine base arm: loading dose 600mg, followed by 300mg 12 hours later, followed by 300mg bid for 4 days; total treatment duration of 5 days\nSupportive care + hydroxychloroquine arm: loading dose 400mg bid, followed by 200mg bid for 4 days; total treatment duration of 5 days.\nSupportive care only. Dosage of chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine will be adjusted, if the patients has a renal impairment with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGDR) <10, to 50% of the initial dosage.\n\nIf patient will be discharged from hospital before the end of the treatment, treatment is continued outside of the hospital. The general practitioner will receive note of the treatment at discharge.\n\nMain studyendpoint Composite endpoint with disease progression defined as a NEWS2score ≥ 7 within 14 days or resulting in admission to Intensive/Medium Care unit or resulting in death within 14 days.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04362332","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Hospitalized COVID-19 patients are consecutively included at admission and randomized 1:1 to either an intervention or control group. Patients randomized to the intervention group will receive a minimal psychoeducational intervention just prior to discharge from the hospital. The goal of the intervention is that patients will be prepared and learn to interpret and react to physical and psychological symptoms that are related to recovering from a COVID-19 infection. Data is collected using standardized and validated patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) to assess mental health outcomes. The primary outcome is patient reported anxiety as assess by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.\n\nPerspectives: This study will provide a comprehensive understanding of the psychological implications of the COVID-19 outbreak. If successful, the minimal intervention is easily implemented in daily clinical practice.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nINTRODUCTION Around 20% of people with COVID-19 becomes seriously ill with pneumonia and multi-organ failure, requiring hospital admission to relieve the symptoms and reduce mortality. To avoid any spreading of the virus, hospitalized COVID-19 patients are isolated. Thus, patients hospitalized with COVID-19 are limited in their social support and their only in-person contact is with healthcare staff in full personal protective equipment. Several studies highlight that isolation due to infection may have negative psychological implications. Moreover, Patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 may experience fear of the consequences of the infection. A high prevalence of persistent mental health problems has been found among patients during infectious disease outbreaks such as the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Researchers and policy makers have highlighted that the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic must be recognized alongside the physical symptoms for all those affected. Moreover, evidence-based evaluations and mental health interventions targeting hospitalized COVID-19 patients and their relatives are at present lacking. If left untreated, these psychological symptoms may have long-term health effects on patients and require treatment adding to the cost burden of managing the illness.\n\nOBJECTIVE The objective of this project is to test the efficacy of a minimal psychoeducational intervention versus standard of care at discharge for reducing symptoms of anxiety in hospitalized patients during the COVID-19 outbreak\n\nMETHODS Design This is a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.\n\nHypothesis The primary hypothesis is that a minimal psychological intervention will reduce anxiety as assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) subscale for anxiety (HADS-A) by 1.5 points from baseline to follow-up 1 month after discharge from hospital. The estimated decrease in HADS-A is based on the clinically important difference found in patients with COPD and isolation studies.\n\nStudy population Patients will be recruited from the Department of Infectious Diseases and the COVID-19 isolation wards at Copenhagen University Hospital, Hvidovre; one of the major hospitals treating COVID-19 patients in Denmark.\n\nEligible patients are consecutively identified at time of admission. Included patients are randomized 1:1 to either a psychoeducational intervention or standard care delivered at discharge.\n\nSample size The primary outcome of interest is the intra-individual differences in HADS-A scores between baseline and follow-up 1 month post discharge. The design is paired with a power of 0.80 and an α at p=0.05. To identify a difference of 1.5 points, which is the minimal clinically important difference based on COPD and isolation studies, with an SD of 2.5 points, 25 patients are required in each group. Since the trial population consists of severely ill patients with high morbidity and mortality rates 2, approximately 30% of the sample are estimated to drop out. Thus, the RCT study requires 66 patients, with 33 in each group.\n\nIntervention at discharge Patients randomized to the intervention group will receive a minimal psychoeducational intervention just prior to discharge from the hospital. The goal of the intervention is that patients will be prepared and learn to interpret and react to physical and psychological symptoms that are related to recovering from a COVID-19 infection. The intervention consists of both written and verbal information. While both the written and verbal information will be primarily targeted the patient, the role of relatives and their possible reactions will be part of the dialogue. A manual describing the content and procedures of the intervention will be developed to ensure that the intervention is both replicable and transparent. The intervention has a planned duration of 30 minutes and will be conducted by a designated study affiliated researcher, who has a background in healthcare (i.e. nurse or medical doctor).\n\nStandard of care at discharge Standard of Care at discharge of patients with COVID-19 from hospital is to inform the patients whom to contact in case of worsening of the physical condition, such as increasing e.g. shortness of breath, and of precautions regarding further isolation to avoid infection of household and other contacts, if relevant. Information regarding the patient´s psychological condition is not part of a standard conversation at discharge.\n\nBlinding Due to the nature of the intervention, the RCT trial is not blinded, but the outcome measures are masked for health professionals and staff until the end of the study.\n\nData collection Data is collected using standardized questionnaires at four timepoints; baseline completed within 48 hours after admission (T0), at discharge, but prior to intervention (T1), 1 month (T2), 3 months (T3), and 12 months (T4). Patients will answer the questionnaires electronically in REDCap© or via phone interview conducted by a study nurse or medical student. Clinical data is collected from the medical records and entered into the REDCap© database.\n\nThe following internationally well validated PROMs will be used to assess mental health/distress:\n\nAnxiety and depression will be assessed using the Danish version of the HADS. The primary outcome in the RCT study is anxiety measured by HADS-A.\nPerceived stress is measured using the Perceived Stress Scale - 10 item (PSS-10).\nHarvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ) is used to assess subjective distress caused by traumatic events.\nHealth related quality of life is measured by SF-12, a short version of the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) 36-item Short-Form Health Survey SF-36.\n\nSociodemographic and clinical variables The following demographic and clinical data are collected from the patients records: age, gender, marital status, residence in nursing home, medicine, smoking status, BMI, previous history of psychiatric illness, physical symptoms, and clinical parameters such as Temperature (>/> 38C); demand of oxygen support (< 5 litres O2/minute; 5-10 litres O2/minute; >10-30 O2/minute or need for mechanical ventilation). Biochemical parameters (Hemoglobin, White Blood Cell (WBC) count, lymphocyte count, Lactate Dehydrogenase, Alanine Amino Transferase (ALT), CRP). Length of hospital stay is collected at discharge. Information regarding contact to general practitioner and current psychological treatment outside of the study is collected during follow-up.\n\nStatistical analysis Descriptive statistics of demographic characteristics at baseline (T0) will be computed. The primary analysis for the RCT study will be performed on the basis of the intention-to-treat principle. Baseline data for the two groups will be compared with Student's t test, the chi-square test, or nonparametric tests. To analyse within group differences in outcome scores, a Student´s t test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test will be used. A mixed regression model will be used to assess the change within-group and between groups over time. The co-variables included in the models will be chosen based on an a priori hypothesis, the bivariate analysis and clinical relevance. Analyses will be performed using the STATA 13 software and in collaboration with an experienced statistician. All reported p-values are two-sided using a significance level of 0.05.\n\nETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS The study has been approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency [P-2020-349]. The national Health Research Ethics Committee has assessed the intervention as not being a significant biomedical intervention [jr. nr. 20025879]. All participating patients will provide written informed consent before any data collection.\n\nTIME SCHEDULE This is a two-year study initiated as soon as possible and no later than mid April 2020.\n\nDISSIMINATION Publication of positive, neutral or negative results in international, peer-reviewed journals will be sought. In addition, results will be communicated at relevant scientific meetings and conferences.\n\nPERSPECTIVE The results from this study have a number of important potential implications. First, by quantifying the magnitude of psychiatric symptoms among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, potential risk factors associated with these symptoms can be identified. Second, there is a need to develop and test the efficacy of minimal psychological intervention for reducing psychiatric morbidity among COVID-19 patients. Providing psychological treatment and support may reduce the burden of comorbid mental health conditions both short and long-term. The challenge is to provide mental health services in the context of patient isolation. Hence, the intervention is designed to give healthcare professionals an instrument that is clinically applicable and easy to implement even in isolated patients. Finally, the longitudinal design of the study capturing experiences over time, can be used to identify when in the trajectory psychological interventions are most needed.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04351789","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

This study will be performed as a pragmatic clinical trial.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nDisease Progression and Timing of Intervention The intervention described herein focuses on adjustment of patient positioning aimed at improving gas exchange and lung function in patients harboring COVID-19. This intervention will target the inpatient setting generally.\n\nScientific/Clinical Rationale for Approach Since emergence of the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) now designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), one in six affected patients becomes seriously ill. The lung appears to be the most susceptible target organ, with a large swath of symptomatic patients struggling with mild upper respiratory tract illness and severe viral pneumonia resulting in respiratory failure. This respiratory failure is often fatal, with one study showing 28% non-survivors having experienced respiratory failure. Moreover, 81-97% of patients requiring mechanical ventilation do not survive.\n\nLike its interaction with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the functional receptor for COVID-19. Viral adherence to host-cell membrane associated ACE2 facilitates the proximity required for viral \"spike\" mediated genetic material injection. In COVID-19, this spike is 10-20 times more likely to bind ACE2 than SARS. ACE2 is expressed in 0.64% of all human lung cells, with 83% of those cells being alveolar epithelial type II. In addition, gene ontology enrichment analysis showed that the ACE2-expressing alveolar epithelial type II have high levels of multiple viral process-related genes, including regulatory genes for viral processes, viral life cycle, viral assembly, and viral genome replication, suggesting that the ACE2-expressing alveolar epithelial type II cells facilitate coronaviral replication in the lung. Thus, these cells likely serve as a ready reservoir for viral invasion. Perhaps more importantly, alveolar type II cells function to generate and recycle surfactant essential to respiratory activity. Surfactant defends against alveolar collapse at low lung volume and protects the lung from injuries/infections caused by inhaled particles and micro-organisms. In COVID-19, if these vital cells are being destroyed, alveolar failure may ensue with severe lung impairment. Thus, interventions that are aimed at improving pressure normalization and alveolar protection may be beneficial in these patients.\n\nProne positioning (PP) has long been used to combat hypoxemia in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Improvements in gas exchange result from improved alveolar ventilation and blood flow redistribution with enhanced perfusion following. PP reduces lung over inflation and bolsters alveolar recruitment. PP also promotes uniformity of vertical pleural pressure gradients resulting in more uniform alveolar size. Considering these physiologic factors together, we hypothesize PP serves to balance stress and strain within the lungs of non-critically ill patients with COVID-19 leading to improved outcomes compared to traditional supine positioning.\n\nPrior Research Supporting the Positioning Model:\n\nMultiple studies have been conducted that support the use of PP as a proactive treatment to combat hypoxemia in ARDS. Each year, approximately 170,000 people are diagnosed with ARDS, and those diagnosed face mortality rates between 25% and 40%. The use of PP stretches back to the 1970s, as providers began to search for ways to ameliorate ARDS symptomatology and reduce the then even higher levels of mortality associated with it. Following initial reports that PP significantly improved oxygenation in 70-80% of patients with ARDS, it was adopted as a standard treatment option. Initially, randomized clinical trials struggled to replicate these findings, citing multiple limitations to study enrollment and treatment standardization that made ascertaining conclusive results difficult. Only as RCT construction has been refined to accommodate for these limitations have the benefits of PP been more clearly demonstrated.\n\nThese beneficial effects have been recently upheld by the landmark PROSEVA study, a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled trial, that randomly assigned 466 patients with severe ARDS to undergo prone-positioning sessions of at least 16 hours or to be left in the supine position. Their results demonstrated a significant improvement in both 28- and 90-day mortality rates: \"the 28-day mortality was 16.0% in the prone group and 32.8% in the supine group (P<0.001). The hazard ratio for death with prone positioning was 0.39 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25 to 0.63). Unadjusted 90-day mortality was 23.6% in the prone group versus 41.0% in the supine group (P<0.001), with a hazard ratio of 0.44 (95% CI, 0.29 to 0.67)\".\n\nPer these positive findings, PP has been consistently shown to be an effective mechanism to increase oxygenation in patients with ARDS when implemented under the following conditions: early enlisting of treatment and its consistent maintenance for at least 16 hours per day, and with concurrent use of lung-protective therapies. Translating these findings towards treatment of COVID-19 positive patients seems promising given the similarity of manifested symptoms and complications.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04359797","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Infusion of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) has been shown to increase activity of lymphocytes, which are a crucial component of the body's defense against viral disease progression and adaptive immunity. Ascorbic acid infusion has been shown to be a safe treatment for patients suffering from sepsis and certain types of cancer. This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ascorbic acid in the form of sequential I.V. infusions (Ascor®) for patients with suspected COVID-19 who are unlikely to require mechanical ventilation within 24 hours of study intervention.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nAscorbic acid [AA] (vitamin C) is an essential nutrient that, in addition to aiding tissue repair, also functions as an enzyme co-factor, an antioxidant, and a key component in lymphocyte development and function. Lymphocytes are responsible for adaptive immunity, the immune response following vaccination, in addition to playing a vital role in protection against viral disease progression. Both sepsis and aberrant lymphocyte activation have been associated with severe AA deficiency. We hypothesize that the administration of increasing concentrations of pharmacologic AA promotes lymphocyte activation and signaling in newly admitted, non-ventilator dependent COVID-19 patients via hydrogen peroxide generation and/or DNA de-methylation, and that this will lead to improved clinical outcomes.\n\nThis is a single-center, prospective, randomized, open-label, phase II clinical trial designed to assess the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of pharmacologic AA administration in hospitalized patients newly-diagnosed with COVID-19 who will likely not require mechanical ventilation within 24 hours of study intervention. All subjects enrolled will be pending inpatient admission or already admitted as they will require supplemental oxygen. Within 12 hours of admission to the E.D. or medical/surgical floor (rapid screens to determine eligibility must be completed within this time), patients will receive escalating pharmacologic AA over 2 hours once daily for 3 escalating doses, then continued on the highest dose for a total of 6 infusions.\n\nSubjects will be randomized 2:1, with 66 subjects receiving AA treatments and 22 subjects receiving routine clinical care. The open-label design allows investigators to evaluate the safety and clinical progress in real-time. Any subject randomized to AA treatment who is upgraded to ICU-level care, requires high-flow O2 supplementation, or is intubated, will no longer receive AA infusions in order to maximize patient safety during this study. Given the robust safety data on the treatment, a phase II design was chosen with an interim safety analysis after 21 patients. Randomization will be stratified according to high vs. low risk of complications. Patients will be considered to be high risk if they have any of the following characteristics: age>60, hypertension, structural lung disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, immunocompromising conditions or meds (such as immunosuppressing meds in transplant patients).","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04363216","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

COVID-19 coagulopathy is characterized by elevated D-dimer, an indicator of fibrin formation and clot lysis, and a mildly prolonged prothrombin time, suggestive of coagulation consumption. To date, it seems that COVID-19 coagulopathy manifests with thromboembolism, thus anticoagulation may be of benefit.

Due to the high mortality of severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 and for ethical reasons, a control arm will not be included. Patients will be recruited by signing an informed consent and the baseline variables of interest will be recorded. Tocilizumab will be administered in one or two doses, depending on the case, and will be followed up for 30 days. The response to treatment, survival and evolution will be studied. Factors associated with improvement of ARDS and survival will be identified through multivariate analyzes. The results will be compared with those reported internationally.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nIn December 2019, a group of patients with the acute respiratory disease was detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China. A month later, a new beta-coronavirus was identified as the cause of the 2019 coronavirus infection. Despite China's efforts to contain the disease, it spread rapidly outside the continent. Currently, Mexico is one of the countries that is facing this world health problem with a dynamic and exponential increase in the number of confirmed cases.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus that belongs to the group of β-coronaviruses of the subgenus Coronaviridae. The SARS-CoV-2 is the third known zoonotic coronavirus disease after severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS). The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 recommended by the WHO, CDC is the collection of a sample from the upper respiratory tract (nasal and oropharyngeal exudate) or from the lower respiratory tract such as expectoration of endotracheal aspirate and bronchioloalveolar lavage and its analysis using the test of real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).\n\nThe clinical manifestations of the patients are heterogeneous presenting asymptomatic symptoms, mild respiratory disease, severe pneumonia, acute respiratory failure syndrome (ARDS), and even death. According to the Berlin definition, ARDS is an acute lung injury that occurs within 7 days after the triggering event and is characterized by bilateral lung infiltrates and severe progressive hypoxemia, as well as non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The mortality associated with ARDS depends on its severity: mild 27%, moderate 32%, and severe 45%. In patients with SARS and SARS-CoV-2, the average duration of mechanical ventilation was reported in 10 (7-12) days, achieving extubation in 6/18 (33%) of which their meantime under mechanical ventilation was 11 (7-12) days. Of these patients, none received treatment with tocilizumab, only 1 patient received hydroxychloroquine, and another patient was treated with lopinavir-ritonavir. Therefore, the present study proposes that the use of Tocilizamab will shorten the time to improve, so an evaluation of the ARDS will be carried out at 7 days.\n\nInitial reports suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a severe illness that requires the intensive care unit in approximately 5% of confirmed infections. In the CDC report from China, the clinical manifestations of the disease were divided into:\n\nMild: Mild respiratory symptoms (cough, malaise, temperature> 37.5, runny nose) with or without pneumonia data by an imaging study (up to 81% cases) Severe: dyspnea, increase in respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths / min, oxygen saturation ≤ 93%, PaO2 / FiO2 <300 mmHg, and image lung infiltrates> 50% within 24 to 48 hours of symptom onset (up to 14 % of the cases) Critical: respiratory failure, septic shock and/or multiple organ failure (up to 5% of cases)\n\nChina's mortality rate from SARS-CoV-2 was 2.84%, with a ratio of male to female deaths of 3.25: 1. The average age of death was 75 years, and the average time from the first symptom to death was 14 days. For people age 70 and older, the average time from first symptoms to death was shorter than for people younger than age 70. In another retrospective study of 99 cases, 17% of patients developed Acute Respiratory Failure Syndrome (ARDS), and 11% worsened in a few days and died. Critical case mortality has been documented to reach 60.5%, however, Mexico still does not exist epidemiological data because is not yet reached the zenith of the pandemic.\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 infection causes dysregulation of the immune response mediated by cytokines and chemokines. An increase in inflammation-related cytokines including IL-2, IL-7, and IL-10, colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), protein 10 inducible interferon g (IP10), protein, was reported in plasma samples from patients. monocyte chemoattractant (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP1A), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), especially in severe patients. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 patients have a large infiltrate of inflammatory immune cells and severe lung inflammation. IL-6 and IL-10 expression levels increase the risk of progression to a critical condition.\n\nCytokine storm syndrome is a phenomenon during which there is an immune dysregulation due to the increase of proinflammatory cytokines in response to stimulation by microorganisms or drugs.\n\nUnder homeostasis conditions, the body's pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine concentrations remain relatively balanced. Before infection, there may be abnormal and dysregulated activation of dendritic cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, and NK cells. The release and action of a large number of proinflammatory cytokines facilitate a positive feedback loop. After a certain threshold, there may be a cytokine storm. Patients will present with fever, diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC), shock, and organ failure. The transition from mild to severe disease in COVID-19 patients may be caused by a cytokine storm.\n\nManifestations of a dysregulated inflammatory response have been identified in patients with COVID-19. The cardinal features of this syndrome include constant fever, cytopenias, and hyperferritinemia. Pulmonary involvement, including ARDS, occurs in approximately 50% of patients. A cytokine profile that resembles LHHS has been associated with COVID-19 disease severity.\n\nAt the time of infection, immune mechanisms are activated, including specific and non-specific immune responses. Endogenous viral protein synthesized within infected cells can activate virus-specific CD8 + T cells through the major pathway of the histocompatibility complex-I (MHC-I). There is then proliferation, differentiation, and effector responses of CD8 + T cells (24). Increased IL-2, IL-7, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interferon-γ inducible protein 10, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-α, and necrosis factor have been observed in severe cases tumor-α. Continuous and dysregulated amplification exacerbates the manifestations associated with infection, while hypoxia and necrosis eventually lead to an uncontrolled inflammatory response and will trigger cytokine storms. There is a probability that immunosuppression is beneficial in a hyper-inflammatory state.\n\nTherapeutic options include steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, selective cytokine blockade (eg, Anakinra or Tocilizumab), JAK inhibition, vaccines, reinfusion of serum from recovered patients, progenitor therapy, elimination of immune cells (eg. , Alendizumab, Rituximab), among others.\n\nAll patients with severe COVID - 19 should undergo tests for hyper inflammation using laboratory tests such as ferritin levels, platelet count, globulin sedimentation rate, and H score measurement in order to determine the subgroup of patients to whom the immunosuppression may improve the risk of mortality.\n\nA study carried out to identify the immune characteristics of those infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed that patients in the intensive care unit had a significant decrease in hemoglobin and albumin, with an increase in concentrations of the c-reactive protein (PCR), alanine aminotransfer (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (DHL). The total number of leukocytes did not show significant differences, while the number of lymphocytes decreased significantly. Furthermore, they found an increase in the number of G-CSF and in IL-6, suggesting a high risk of monocyte-mediated release of inflammatory cytokines that can migrate to the lung and produce severe clinical manifestations and even death.\n\nThe management of the critically ill adult patient with SARS-CoV-2 is not standardizing, however, the panel of experts from the \"Surviving Sepsis Campaign\" has published 54 recommendations for the management of the patient with severe SARS-CoV-2 and ARDS. The recommendations focus on hemodynamic support, fluid therapy, use of vasoactive agents, invasive mechanical ventilation, as well as management of the \"cytokine storm\" syndrome.\n\nOne of the proposals for the treatment of cytokine storm and macrophage activation in severe or critical stages of SARS-CoV-2 is the use of drugs that inhibit the interaction of IL-6 with its receptor. Tocilizumab (TCZ) is a humanized recombinant monoclonal antibody of the IgG1 immunoglobulin subclass, is directed against soluble or membrane IL-6 receptors (IL-6R). TCZ inhibits the binding of IL-6 to its receptor by reducing pro-inflammatory activity.\n\nThe use of TCZ in patients with severe/critical SARS-CoV-2 was first reported in China. Patients received TCZ treatment at an initial dose of 400 mg with an additional dose in the patient with persistent fever (maximum of two doses). The patients presented a rapid reduction in fever and in the supplemental oxygen requirement in the days after receiving the medication. Despite the promising results of this study, there is currently no solid evidence demonstrating the safety and efficacy of TCZ for the clinical treatment of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. The FDA recently approved a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TCZ (ActemraMR) added to standard care in hospitalized adult patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 disease, which will be held in the United States of America (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04320615). Likewise, Italy is recruiting patients for a phase II study with a single TCZ treatment arm in critically ill patients (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04317092, NCT04315480). China is conducting a study with Tocilizumab vs. renal replacement therapy for the management of cytokine release syndrome (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04306705). In patients with mild-moderate SARS-CoV-2, the US will initiate a phase 2 study in 50 patients to assess its efficacy (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04331795). As well as its comparison with other medications (hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04332094) and combinations (Favipiravir + Tocilizumab vs Favipiravir and Tocilizumab ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04310228).","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04363853","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Cardiac dysfunction occurred in COVID-19 patients, but the law and mechanism of cardiac dysfunction remains unclear. The occurrence of progressive inflammatory factor storm and coagulation dysfunction in severe and fatal cases of NCP points out a new direction for reducing the incidence of severe and critically ill patients, shortening the length of duration in severe and critically ill patients and reducing the incidence of complications of cardiovascular diseases. Aspirin has the triple effects of inhibiting virus replication, anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory, but it has not received attention in the treatment and prevention of NCP. Although Aspirin is not commonly used in the guidelines for the treatment of NCP, it was widely used in the treatment and prevention of a variety of human diseases after its first synthesis in 1898. Subsequently, aspirin has been confirmed to have antiviral effect on multiple levels. Moreover, one study has confirmed that aspirin can inhibit virus replication by inhibiting prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in macrophages and upregulation of type I interferon production. Subsequently, pharmacological studies have found that aspirin as an anti-inflammatory and analgesic drug by inhibiting cox-oxidase (COX). Under certain conditions, the platelet is the main contributor of innate immune response, studies have found that in the lung injury model in dynamic neutrophil and platelet aggregation.\n\nIn summary, the early use of aspirin in covid-19 patients, which has the effects of inhibiting virus replication, anti-platelet aggregation, anti-inflammatory and anti-lung injury, is expected to reduce the incidence of severe and critical patients, shorten the length of hospital duration and reduce the incidence of cardiovascular complications.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nCOVID-19 has a high infection rate and mortality, and serious complications such as heart injury cannot be ignored.\n\nAt present, the scale and harm of COVID 19 (Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) has far surpassed that of SARS in 2003, with more than 80,000 cases confirmed in China and 3,119 deaths due to the disease. The total mortality rate is 2.1%, among which the mortality rate in wuhan is still as high as 4.8%. The main causes of death of covid-19 are currently thought to be acute respiratory failure, \"immune factor storm\" and coagulation dysfunction caused by lung dysfunction, but heart injury cannot be ignored.\n\nA recent article published in the Lancet by professor Bin Cao's team from china-japan friendship hospital analyzed a total of 41 patients diagnosed with covid-19, including 6 (15%) patients with hypertension, 6 (15%) patients with cardiovascular disease, and 5 (12%) patients with acute myocardial injury after infection [1]. A study published in the journal of the American medical association (JAMA) included 138 COVID-19 patients, 43 (31.2%) with hypertension and 20 (14.5%) with cardiovascular disease. At the same time, data analysis found that a total of 77 (55.8%) patients had complications, among which 10 (7.2%) had acute myocardial injury, 23 (16.7%) had arrhythmia, and the incidence of cardiac complications in ICU patients was significantly higher than that in general ward patients [2]. Therefore, the incidence of cardiac complications is high in NCP patients, but the characteristics and mechanism of cardiac injury are still unclear. To further explore the characteristics and mechanisms of cardiac injury in patients with COVID-19 is of great scientific significance for us to propose new prevention and treatment strategies for cardiac injury. Therefore, it is of great clinical significance and social value to solve some problems in current clinical treatment through systematic clinical research, to discuss the characteristics of heart injury in NCP patients, and to explore standardized, safe and effective prevention and treatment programs for NCP heart injury.\n\nCardiac dysfunction occurred in COVID-19 patients, but the law and mechanism of cardiac dysfunction remains unclear.\n\nViral myocarditis refers to the myocardial localized or diffused acute or chronic inflammatory lesions caused by viral infection, which is an infectious myocardial disease. Multiple viruses (such as coxsackievirus group B virus, etc.) can cause myocarditis after infection. Previous studies have found that SARS-CoV with high homology of NCP can cause obvious myocardial injury. The autopsy reports found SARS-CoV RNA in the myocardium of the SARS infected patient, as well as significant macrophage infiltration and myocardial injury. Oudit et al. found that in patients with SARS-CoV myocardial involvement, the expression of ACE-2 was also significantly decreased [3]. McLellan's team from the university of Texas at Austin has uploaded a novel coronavirus to BioRxiv in a preprint of BioRxiv a cryo-electron microscope structure of S protein, a key component of the virus. It turned out that the binding strength of the novel coronavirus S protein to ACE-2 was about 15nM, 10 to 20 times that of the SARS virus binding to ACE2. Therefore, NCP is likely to cause myocarditis directly.\n\nRecently, in view of COVID - 19 deaths in patients with clinical analysis found that, compared to surviving COVID - 19 patients, death cases appeared in the course of illness progressive severe hypoxia (oxygen saturation significantly reduced), progressive lymphocytes reduce, progressive increase in the number of white blood cells and neutrophils, blood coagulation dysfunction (D - dimer significantly higher), and so on, these phenomena are likely to cause or aggravate myocardial injury [2]. Cardiac and pulmonary failure caused by severe myocardial injury is an important factor leading to death in severe and critical COVID-19 patients. Therefore, it is urgent to strengthen the early monitoring of cardiac function and myocardial enzyme spectrum of covid-19 patients, to identify the changes and characteristics of cardiac function in covid-19 patients, and to achieve early detection and early intervention, which is of great significance to reduce the incidence of severe and critical patients and shorten the hospitalization time of severe and critical patients.\n\nThe occurrence of progressive inflammatory factor storm and coagulation dysfunction in severe and fatal cases of NCP points out a new direction for reducing the incidence of severe and critically ill patients, shortening the length of duration in severe and critically ill patients and reducing the incidence of complications of cardiovascular diseases\n\nRecently, studies from JAMA and Lancet reported that progressive d-dimer elevation occurred in NCP deaths. Progressive lymphocytopenia and the number of leukocytes and neutrophils increased progressively. The creatinine level increased rapidly from day 11, but in the early course of the disease, the creatinine fluctuation was more obvious than in the surviving patients, and the level was more likely to exceed the normal upper limit. In addition, the levels of inflammatory factors (such as L2, IL7, IL10, GCSF, P10, MCP1, MIP1A and TNF TNF) in critically ill ICU patients were significantly higher than those in non-icu patients [1, 2]. The above evidence suggests that the increase of neutrophils may be related to the cytokine storm caused by virus invasion. Clotting activation may be associated with a persistent inflammatory response; Acute kidney injury may be related to the direct effects of virus, hypoxia, and shock. All three of these pathways may be cofactors in triggering death.\n\nOnce the cytokine storm occurs in infected patients, the disease will rapidly deteriorate, leading to multiple organ failure. The heart is a common organ involved in cytokine storms, including myocardial injury, stress cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and malignant arrhythmia, each of which may lead to sudden death. Therefore, according to these evidences, early coagulation intervention and anti-inflammatory therapy are expected to reduce the incidence of severe and critically ill patients, shorten the hospitalization time of severe and critically ill patients and reduce the incidence of complications of cardiovascular diseases.\n\nAspirin has the triple effects of inhibiting virus replication, anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory, but it has not received attention in the treatment and prevention of NCP.\n\nAlthough Aspirin is not commonly used in the guidelines for the treatment of NCP, it was widely used in the treatment and prevention of a variety of human diseases after its first synthesis in 1898. First, aspirin was first synthesized in 1898 and has been widely used in the treatment and prevention of many human diseases. Subsequently, aspirin has been confirmed to have antiviral effect on multiple levels [4]. However, one study published in Immunity in 2014, has confirmed that aspirin can inhibit virus replication by inhibiting prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in macrophages and upregulation of type I interferon production [5]. Subsequently, pharmacological studies have found that aspirin as an anti-inflammatory and analgesic drug by inhibiting cox-oxidase (COX). Because it was first discovered by inhibiting the activity of cox-oxidase (COX), inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandin, inhibiting the aggregation of white blood cells, reducing the formation of bradykinin, inhibiting the aggregation of platelets and so on. Under certain conditions, the platelet is the main contributor of innate immune response, studies have found that in the lung injury model in dynamic neutrophil and platelet aggregation, and aspirin by promoting lipid oxygen element (Lipoxin, 15 - epi - LXA4), and reduce the number of neutrophils and inhibition of neutrophil and platelet aggregation, in inhibiting the inflammatory response and lung injury has a key role in the model [6]. Compared with other NSAIDS, low-dose aspirin (less than 100 mg/ day) is highly safe for long-term use and has fewer adverse events such as gastrointestinal bleeding. And a recent meta-analysis published in JAMA Intern Med found that in the treatment of DVP in patients with total hip or total knee replacement, The anticoagulant effect and side effects of aspirin were not significantly different from other anticoagulants (dalteparin sodium, Rivaroxaban, enoxaparin sodium, Warfarin sodium, Dihydroergotamine mesylate -- heparin sodium) [7]. The dosages of aspirin used in the reviewed literature ranged from 81 mg/d to 325 mg/d, but the majority of the literature used 100 mg/d was consistent with our current clinical dosages. A number of studies have found that aspirin also has other extensive effects, such as anti-tumor [8], regulation of gestational hypertension [9], prevention of preterm birth [10].\n\nIn summary, there is still a lack of effective drugs for the treatment of covid-19, and the regularity and characteristics of myocardial injury in patients are unclear. In addition, prevention and treatment strategies for myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients have not been put on the agenda. The early use of aspirin in covid-19 patients, which also has the effects of inhibiting virus replication, anti-platelet aggregation, anti-inflammatory and anti-lung injury, is expected to reduce the incidence of severe and critical patients, shorten the length of hospital duration and reduce the incidence of cardiovascular complications.\n\nThis project is based on important clinical issues, combined with the latest international research progress, to explore the early use of aspirin enteric-coated tablets in covid-19 patients on the treatment of covid-19 and the prevention of cardiovascular complications, to contribute to the prevention and control of the epidemic, undoubtedly has important theoretical and application value.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04365309","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

No specific pharmacological treatment is available yet. Pulmonary lesions in these patients are related to both viral infection and an inflammatory reaction. Patients admitted to intensive care have an important inflammatory response and increased plasma concentrations of IL2, IL7, IL10, GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα. In the blood, the number of peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cells appears to be significantly reduced, while their status is hyperactivated. This is evidenced by immunoreactive cytometrics for HLA-DR (CD4 3-47%) and CD38 (CD8 39-4%) or by an increase in the proportion of highly pro-inflammatory Th 17 CCR6+ lymphocytes. In addition, CD8 T cells would exhibit a highly cytotoxic profile characterized by high concentrations of cytotoxic granules, perforin+, granulysin+ or double positive, suggesting associated complement activation. Because of their immunomodulatory action, which can attenuate the inflammatory response; and also strengthen the anti-viral defence, it is proposed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous immunoglobulin (IGIV) administration in patients developing post-SARS-CoV2 ARDS. IGIV modifies cell function of dendritic cells, cytokine and chemokine networks and T-lymphocytes, resulting in the proliferation of regulatory T cells to regulate the activity of T lymphocytes CD4 or CD8. The action of IGIV induces an activation more particularly of lymphocytes T regulators that could modulate the effects of the lymphocyte populations described in the study by Xu et al during COVID-19. In addition, IGIV modulate humoral acquired immunity, through their effect on the idiotypic network and antibody production. They also act on innate immunity, through antigen neutralization and modulation of phagocytic cells. These effects result in a decrease in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and complement activation, key factors in post-SARS-CoV2 ARDS. IGIV is part of the treatment for a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The standard IGIV as well as polyclonal IGIV significantly reduced mortality in patients with septic shock and in Kawasaki disease, which is post-viral vasculitis of the child. In addition, they would not only be beneficial in post-influenza ARDS, but also would also in 3 cases of post-SARS-CoV2 ARDS.

Often these patients further deteriorate while on mechanical ventilation. This trial will determine the feasibility and safety of a therapy that can potentially improve lung function, reduce the need for mechanical ventilation and hopefully impact mortality.\n\nAdult patients with COVID-19 induced respiratory failure will be randomly assigned to receive either standard treatment or standard treatment plus exogenous surfactant.

Importantly, exogenous surfactant is already utilized all over the world to reduce mortality in preterm infants. When tested in adults with ARDS, it was shown to be well tolerated and safe. Furthermore, clinical and laboratory evidence suggests that this therapy may be most effective in patients with a direct lung infection, and when administered shortly after the patient is intubated. In this study, twenty patients who are proven COVID-19 positive and require MV due to progressive respiratory failure will be randomized to receive either 1) exogenous surfactant (BLES) as soon as possible and within 48 hours of intubation and stabilization, or 2) treatment as usual (will not be treated with surfactant).

Controls will include a randomised arm to receive BAC, historic data from UCLH patients with COVID-19 and biobanked samples will be used to demonstrate an effect of dornase alfa. CRP will be measured to assess the effect of dornase alfa on inflammation. Clinical endpoints and biomarkers (e.g. d-dimer) will be used to assess the clinical response. Exploratory endpoints will explore the effects of dornase alfa on features of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs).\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nDornase alfa is a recombinant human DNase enzyme indicated in conjunction with standard therapies for the management of cystic fibrosis (CF) to improve pulmonary function. Dornase alfa degrades extracellular DNA, and so promotes the clearance of NETs and lead to a significant improvement in lung function for treated CF patients by facilitating mucus clearance in the lung. Dornase alfa is approved worldwide as a nebulised formulation, with an excellent safety profile and is well tolerated. The most common side effect is a hoarse voice. Moreover, dornase alfa could be administered in addition to effective antiviral therapy and should not interfere with antiviral drugs that could be used for COVID-19.\n\nBy facilitating the clearance of NETs, dornase alfa not only facilitates sputum clearance in CF patients, but has additional anti-inflammatory activity. Dornase alfa has been shown to reduce NETs in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and sputum of participants with CF (Konstan et al 2012). In the Bronchoalveolar Lavage for the Evaluation of Anti-inflammatory Treatment (BEAT) study, the percentage of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid significantly increased in untreated CF patients (P<0.02) while remaining constant in the dornase alfa-treated group. Levels of elastase and IL-8 also significantly increased from baseline in the untreated group (P<0.007 and P<0.02 for elastase and IL-8, respectively), but remained stable in patients receiving dornase alfa (Konstan and Ratjen, J. Cyst. Fibros. 2012).\n\nThere is scientific evidence to support the potential benefits of dornase alfa in COVID-19 infection. Viral sepsis driven by a hyperinflammation is thought to be a major cause of mortality in COVID-19 infection. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6 and TNFα are key cytokines in microbial sepsis. Positive outcomes with Roche's Actemra (tocilizumab), an antibody that blocks the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), in COVID-19 treatment has led to several anti-inflammatory trials.\n\nOur hypothesis is that nebulised dornase alfa will break down the DNA backbone of NETs in the COVID-19 lung which will promote the degradation of pro-inflammatory extracellular histones and prevent the amplification of the inflammatory response and the resultant lung damage.\n\nPositive data will enable rapid testing into a large clinical trial in the UK and prevent ICU capacity issues faced today. Dornase alfa is a cost-effective drug and is currently available for prescription.\n\nWe propose to test this hypothesis with this COVASE Phase IIa trial. We propose that all people with COVID-19 who are admitted to hospital for supplementary oxygen, who showed evidence of systemic inflammation but did not immediately require intubation and ventilation, would be eligible for nebulised dornase alfa, a safe and cost-effective treatment, twice daily for 7 days.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04359654","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

It is imperative not to decrease the immune host response during this phase by prohibiting the use of non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids at this stage and developing an anti-viral strategy. The late phase, around Day 7-9, depends only upon host response and is linked to an excessive inflammatory response with a major increase of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, MCP-1, GCSF indicative of IL-1b excess, as well as IP-10, MIP-1, indicative of IFNg signature, corresponding to a \"cytokine storm\".

After verification of eligibility criteria and written informed consent, a nasopharyngeal swab, an ECG and a blood sampled (kalaemia, magnesemia and calcemia) will be performed.\n\nPatient with SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive result and still fulfilling eligibility criteria will be randomized on day2 (D2) through a web-based allocation system, following a computer generated allocation list, stratified on center and existence of any comorbidity, to experimental or control group. Patients without confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection on PCR will not continue the trial. Both groups patients will have a paper-based diary to record their daily symptoms and drug intake. A clinical follow-up will be done by the GP at D5, D8, D14 and D28.The main analysis population will be in intention to treat. An intermediate efficacy analysis is planned when 50% of patients have reached D14.\n\nTwo hundred consecutive patients (from pre-identified centers) will be included in an ancillary virological study to assess evolution of viral load at D8 and D14. For these patients all nasopharyngeal swab will be sent to a centralised lab at Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04371406","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

The vast majority of patients with hypertension and/or diabetes are taking drugs targeting the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) because of their blood pressure-lowering and/or kidney-protective effects. Importantly, the virus causing COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) binds to the transmembrane protein angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) - an important component of RAS - for host cell entry and subsequent viral replication. ACE2 is normally considered to be an enzyme that limits airway inflammation via effects in RAS and increased ACE2 activity seems to alleviate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Importantly, evidence from human studies as well as rodent studies suggests that the inhibition of RAS by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) leads to upregulation of ACE2, and treatment with ARB leads to attenuation of SARS-CoV-induced ARDS. This is of interest, as the vast majority of deaths from COVID-19 are due to ARDS and expression of ACE2 has previously been shown to be reduced by the binding of SARS-CoV to ACE2. Thus, ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been suggested to alleviate the COVID-19 pulmonary manifestations. In contrast to these notions, concern has been raised that ACE2 upregulation (by RAS-inhibiting drugs) will multiply the cellular access points for viral entry and might increase the risk of severe progression of COVID-19. The multiplied viral entry points could perhaps explain the alarmingly high morbidity and mortality among COVID-19 patients with diabetes and/or hypertension. Thus, a delineation of the role of RAS for the course of COVID-19 is of crucial importance for the management of COVID-19 patients.\n\nAim:\n\nThis randomised clinical trial will investigate whether to continue or discontinue treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs in hospitalised patients with COVID-19.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04351581","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Of these, 60% met ARDS criteria leading to death in 25% to 63% of the cases. SARS-CoV2-related ARDS is caused by a massive inflammatory cell infiltration leading to dysregulated cytokine/chemokine responses with lung immunopathological changes. To date, there is no treatment available.\n\nRegulatory T cells (Treg) are a subpopulation of CD4+ T cells playing a crucial role in the control of immune responses, in part by preventing excessive inflammation. Depletion of Treg cells in models of lung infection or after berylium exposure exacerbated lung inflammation. In contrast, a beneficial role for Treg during early ARDS and its resolution has been observed.\n\nLow-dose interleukin 2 (Ld-IL2) is the first therapy driving Treg-specific expansion and activation. Ld-IL2 was successfully tested in a wide range of preclinical models of inflammatory diseases, including beryllium-induced lung inflammation. Moreover, Ld-IL2 has been shown to be safe and free of serious adverse events when administered in patients with various autoimmune diseases.

Tetracyclines are known to chelate zinc from MMPs. Their chelating activity may help inhibit COVID19 infection by limiting its ability to replicate in the host. (2) Tetracyclines may also be able to inhibit the replication of positive-polarity single-stranded RNA viruses, such as COVID19 (demonstrated on the dengue virus). (3) In addition, tetracyclines are modulators of innate immunity (anti-inflammatory activity), a property used in the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases for many years. These modulating effects are noted on several targets of innate immunity: They can decrease the expression of NFKB, the release of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6, inhibit granulomas inflammatory and free radical release.\n\nTetracyclines could therefore participate in limiting the cytokine release induced by COVID19.

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a pandemic on March 11th, 2020. The clinical disease (COVID-19) is mild in 81% of patients, severe disease occurs in 14%, and 5% of cases result in critical illness. The reported overall case fatality rate (CFR) is 2.3% in China, although the CFR varies widely (0.7- 7.2%) between regions. Older age is associate with increased mortality. The reported CFR is 8% among patients 70-79 years old and 15% in those 80 years and older.\n\nMultiple therapies have been proposed based on in vitro evidence or anecdotal reports.

As in any pandemic, maintaining the health and safety of the healthcare workforce is of great importance as health care workers (HCW) remain a critical line of defence against the spread of COVID-19 and play a vital role in the recovery of those already infected. Frontline HCW, such as those in the emergency department (ED), are at high risk of contracting COVID-19 due to their close proximity to patients who may have the virus. The impact of frontline HCW becoming ill and thus unable to go to work is equally high, and of grave risk to the function of the healthcare system and the ability to minimize the impact of the current pandemic. This study aims to evaluate whether hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a well-tolerated drug typically used in the prevention of malaria transmission and rheumatic disease, taken before and during exposure to patients with COVID-19, is effective at reducing COVID-19 infections among ED health care workers.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nOn March 11th, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory virus coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) a pandemic. As of March 22, 2020 there have been over 267,013 confirmed cases and 11,201 deaths in 185 different countries or regions; it is quickly overwhelming health care systems worldwide to detrimental effect. Even with current moderate interventions imposed, estimates predict that 10-18% of the Canadian population will be infected with the virus by its peak in July. Health care workers (HCWs) remain a critical line of defence in the fight against this pandemic and maintaining their health is not only an important social responsibility of the government, but it is also of vital national interest to treat and control others infected with this virus or sick with other disease.\n\nEstimates from China indicate that HCWs make up 3.8% of cases, while in Italy it is reported to be much higher - 8.3%. Early numbers from front-line workers in Italy suggested up to 20% of HCWs become infected with COVID-19, and these rates are approximately 3 times higher than the general population. When HCWs become sick, not only do they risk dying, but they also must take weeks away from work limiting the ability of the health care system to function. The fear associated with becoming ill also causes higher rates of missed work and higher rates of burnout, as seen with previous outbreaks. It is also now clear that asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 not only occurs, but may even be the most important factor in spread of the virus. HCWs may therefore become vectors of viral spread to those who are the most vulnerable in other areas of the hospital. Preventing our HCWs from acquiring SARS-CoV-2 should therefore be of the utmost importance to our national interests.\n\nRepurposing drugs already known to be safe and tolerable in humans provides a major advantage in a pandemic where time is critical. Of candidate drugs, chloroquine (CQ) and its derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), have shown some promise. Originally an anti-malarial medication, CQ exerts direct antiviral effects by inhibiting pH-dependent steps of the replication of several viruses, including coronaviruses. It also has immunomodulatory effects, suppressing the release of TNFα and IL-6, which are involved in the inflammatory complications of several viral diseases. In vitro data has shown that CQ potently blocks virus infection at low micromolar concentrations with a high selectivity index. CQ is also widely distributed throughout the body, including the lungs, after oral administration. An early clinical trial of more than 100 COVID-19 patients in China reported that CQ was superior to placebo in inhibiting pneumonia, improving lung imaging, promoting viral seroconversion, and shortening the disease course, although data was not released. Based on those results experts in China recommended CQ 500mg twice daily for ten days in all patients with COVID-19. HCQ has also been shown to also have anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in vitro and may actually be more potent. It has a better safety profile than CQ (during long term use), and allows a higher daily dose, with fewer concerns of drug-drug interactions. Preliminary clinical data also suggests that HCQ may lead to significantly faster viral clearance in COVID-19 patients as assessed by nasopharyngeal swab (70% vs. 12.5%, p=0.001).\n\nPrEP offers the ability to protect front-line HCWs from illness, decrease nosocomial spread of SARS-CoV-2, and prevent loss of work force due to illness. Rigorous testing of HCQ for this purpose is critical at this time. We therefore aim to conduct the first randomized placebo-controlled trial of HCQ to prevent COVID-19 infections in emergency departments (ED) as we prepare for escalating rates of COVID-19 in Toronto, Canada.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04374942","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

The virus is a positive-strand RNA virus with high homology to bat coronavirus. Depending on published study in which , conserved domain analysis, homology modeling, and molecular docking were used to compare the biological roles of specific proteins of the novel coronavirus. The principal investigator demonstrated according to previous researches that some viral structural and nonstructural proteins could bind to the porphyrin, respectively. At the same time, orf1ab, ORF10 and ORF3a proteins coordinated to attack heme on the 1-beta chain of hemoglobin, COVID-19 binds to the porphyrin of haem and displaces iron and a study denonestrated that Covid-19 could cause acquired acute porphyria which is the condition in which there is excess accumulation of porphyrin intermediate metabolites. This point can be taken advantage of X-ray induced visible luminescence of porphyrin for producing of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). Porphyrins have been used for photodynamic therapy (PDT) against a wide range of targets like bacteria, viruses and tumor cells It has been reported that ROS-based inactivation of viruses may occur due to several reasons, such as protein oxidation, single strand breaks in the RNA genome and protein-RNA crosslinking. Since ROS-based inactivation has a multi-targeted mechanism, it is much less likely that a virus would be able to develop resistance against it. Recently, porphyrins, already in use as photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy (PDT), were a study target to applications in medical area, namely as possible contrast agents in MRI. could be observed some examples of porphyrin derivatives already study as MRI contrast media. Low dark toxicity, neoplastic tissue affinity and synthetic accessibility are some of the important properties that contribute for its selection. In MRI studies was found that CM based on paramagnetic metalloporphyrins showed higher affinity for neoplastic tissues, observed by increased relaxation time of the neoplastic tissues, which is reflected on an increase in MRI signal and consequently in a better neoplastic lesions detection. A study demonestrated that The sulfonated tetranaphthyl porphyrin contrast agents in MRI (TNapPS), sulfonated tetra-anthracenyl porphyrin (TAnthPS), and sulfonated 2,6-difluoro-meso-tetraphenylporphine [TPP(2,6-F2)S] and its copper chelate [TPP(2,6-F2)S,Cu], which reduced HIV infection by 99, 96, 94, and 96%, respectively. Previous studies which showed that Covid -19 binds to the porphyrin of haem and displaces iron in addition to Sulfonated porphyrins and light-stimulated Sn- protoporphyrin IX have broad antiviral activity against more distinct types of viruses, Co-protoporphyrin IX and Sn-protoporphyrin IX inactivate Zika, Chikungunya and other arboviruses by targeting the viral envelope Porphyrins are amphipathic molecules able to interact with membranes and absorb light, being widely used in photodynamic therapy. Previously, we showed that heme, Co-protoporphyrin IX (CoPPIX) and Sn-protoporphyrin IX (SnPPIX) directly inactivate DENV and YFV infectious particles. Here we demonstrate that the antiviral activity of these porphyrins can be broadened to CHIKV, ZIKV, Mayaro virus, Sindb is virus and Vesicular Stomatitis virus. Porphyrin treatment causes viral envelope protein loss, affecting viral morphology, adsorption and entry into target cells ,Therefore, the principal investigator expects that treatment with x-ray induced visible luminescence of porphyrins will be effective in targeting of COVID-19 .\n\nKeywords: COVID 2019 ,Infection, Sulfonated porphyrins and X-ray induced visible luminescence of porphyrin\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nEfficacy of Sn-protoporphyrin IX (SnPPIX) and sulfonaoporphyrin(TPPS) Against Covid-19\n\nOfficial Title: Efficacy of Based MRI Contrast Media Against Covid-19\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIntroduction:\n\nPandemic Covid-19 pneumonia, of SARS-CoV-2 aetiology, presents an existential threat to health care systems globally. Multiple therapeutic and prophylactic agents are currently undergoing clinical trial, including 23 clinical trials of (hydroxy) chloroquine in China. While progress towards a curative agent or vaccine is promising, the principal limiting factor in public health emergency is time, and therefore Virus resistance to antiviral therapies is an increasing concern that makes the development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs urgent. Targeting of the viral envelope, a component shared by a large number of viruses, emerges as a promising strategy to overcome this problem. Natural and synthetic porphyrins are good candidates for antiviral development due to their relative hydrophobicity and pro-oxidant character a pre-existing licensed therapeutic would offer reprieve to health care systems operating at the edge of capacity. In this brief communication, the Principal investigator argues that Covid-19 has high probability of being more than a disease of pneumonia, and that critical Covid-19 patients may be experiencing a form of acquired acute porphyria. Readily available interventions exist to treat acute porphyria and the position is advanced that urinalysis of critical Covid-19 patients would diagnose this pathology.\n\nCOVID-19 bind to porphyrin and cause acquired porphyria.\n\nErythrocytes are strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of Covid-19. Wuhan University researchers argue that the role of erythrocytes in the pathophysiology of Covid-19 is under-estimated; the co-efficient of variation of red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is predictive of severity of disease state (Gong 2020). Elevated RDW is correlated with reduced erythrocyte turnover; red blood cells become smaller as they age and the delay in clearance expands the low-volume tail of the volume distribution (Patel 2015). Suppressed erythrocyte turnover may indicate erythropoietic distress and function as a compensatory mechanism to maintain circulating red blood cell levels (Patel 2015).\n\nExcess porphyrins in red blood cells can precipitate cell lysis and development of hemolytic anaemia (Sassa 2006). Macaques infected with SARS-CoV- 2 also have decreased red blood cell numbers (Munster 2020) and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 appears to be determined by blood group; blood group A is most affected whereas blood group O seems to be protected (Yang 2020). This finding is concordant with previous studies showing that susceptibility to the 2003 strain of SARS-CoV was determined by blood group (Guillon 2008). Preliminary evidence suggests that CD147, the determinant of the Ok blood group system, binds the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (Wang 2020). Incidentally, CD147 functions as an essential receptor for erythrocyte invasion by Plasmodium falciparum (Crosnier 2011). Blockade of CD147 abrogates the normal recirculation of erythrocytes, from the spleen into the general circulation, leading to selective trapping of red blood cells in the spleen as development of a form of anaemia (Coste 2001). Autopsy of deceased Covid-19 patients reveals that the spleen is significantly reduced in size. Reduction in spleen size would be expected in the event that the spleen has emptied its reserve of erythrocytes into the circulation as part of a normal physiological response to anaemia (Dale 2016).\n\nPrimate models of Covid-19 (Munster 2020) and human Covid-19 patients have subnormal haemoglobin levels (Chen 2020). Clinical evaluation of almost 100 Wuhan patients reveals haemoglobin levels below the normal range in most patients as well as increased total bilirubin and elevated serum ferritin (Chen 2020). Hyperbilirubinemia is observed in acute porphyria (Sassa 2006) and would be consistent with ineffective erythropoiesis (Sulovska 2016) and rapid haemoglobin turnover.\n\nCOVID-19 and Porphyrin of haem:-\n\nElevated serum ferritin levels are typical of acute porphyria (Trier 2013) and would be expected upon dissociation of iron from haem. A mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 might attack the 1beta chain of haemoglobin has been proposed; the product of open reading frame 8 (ORF8) binds to the porphyrin of haem and displaces iron, according to bioinformatics prediction analyses (Liu 2020).\n\nThe oxygen-carrying capacity of erythrocytes would therefore be compromised by SARS-CoV-2, thereby exacerbating the difficulties already experienced by the patient, in terms of maintaining partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli (PaO2). While the impact of SARS-CoV-2 targeting of haemoglobin on oxygen content of the blood would therefore be considerable, the author proposes that perhaps of greater concern, are potential ramifications upon homeostatic regulation of haem anabolism. Haem biosynthesis is exquisitely controlled by seven enzyme-controlled reactions proceeding from the first intermediate, aminolevulinic acid (ALA), to haem as thefinal product. Haem negatively regulates the first step in the pathway by repressing expression of aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS).\n\nSARSCoV- 2 is predicted to directly interfere with haem production (Liu 2020), and this prediction is supported by empirical evidence of reduced haemoglobin levels in Covid-19 patients (Chen 2020) and in animal models of the disease (Munster 2020). Decreased haem production dampens repression of ALAS, and thereby increases the production of haem precursors, leading to accumulation of porphyrin intermediate metabolites. All of the haem pathway intermediates are potentially toxic (Sassa 2006). During an attack of acute porphyria, ALAS is induced 2006) and this perturbation continues until sufficient haem synthesis is restored. Phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 porphyrin excess is hypothesised to mimic extreme lead poisoning; both as examples of acquired acute porphyria.\n\nOverproduction of haem precursors - aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG), in particular - manifests life-threatening attacks (Pischik 2015) with neurovisceral symptoms (Sassa 2006), including: abdominal pain (85-95% cases), vomiting (43-88%), constipation (48-84%), muscle weakness (42-60%), mental symptoms (40-58%), pain of the limbs, head, neck and chest (50-52%), hypertension (36-54%), tachycardia (28-80%), convulsion (10-20%), sensory loss (9-38%), fever (9-37%), respiratory paralysis (5-12%) and diarrhoea (5-12%). Neurotoxicity of aminolevulinic acid accounts for the plethora of neurovisceral symptoms and, interestingly, there is considerable overlap between neurovisceral complaints of ALA excess and extra-pulmonary symptoms of critical Covid-19 patients. Extra-pulmonary symptoms of Covid-19 are significant but under-estimated, including gastrointestinal symptoms (Poggiali 2020), which news reports suggest may affect in the region of 50% Covid-19 patients. Neurological problems also appear to be overlooked by the hyper-focus on respiratory symptoms (Zhao 2020). Of 214 Covid-19 patients, 36.4% experienced neurological manifestations including: headache, dizziness, acute cerebrovascular incidents and impaired consciousness (Mao 2020). Loss of autonomic control of breathing has also been reported and autonomic neuropathy is a clinical feature of acute porphyria (Laiwah 1985). Neuropsychiatric symptoms of Covid-19 may be downstream of irregularities in haem metabolism.\n\nThe most important question is now asked by Principal investigator Can X ray stimulated porphyrins act against COVID-19 as like as Sn- protoporphyrin IX mechanism in impeding the entry and division of the virus(Zika, Chikungunya and other arbo viruses) by targeting the viral envelope and protect hemoglobin and blood components that are affected by the viral infection?\n\nThe principal investigator expect the possibility of inhibiting Covid -19 by Sulfonated porphyrins X-ray induced visible luminescence of porphyrin and light-stimulated Sn- protoporphyrin IX because According to previous studies which showed that Covid -19 binds to the porphyrin of haem and displaces iron in addition to Sulfonated porphyrins and light-stimulated Sn- protoporphyrin IX have broad antiviral activity against more distinct types of viruses, Co-protoporphyrin IX and Sn-protoporphyrin IX inactivate Zika, Chikungunya and other arboviruses by targeting the viral envelope Porphyrins are amphipathic molecules able to interact with membranes and absorb light, being widely used in photodynamic therapy. Previously, we showed that heme, Co-protoporphyrin IX (CoPPIX) and Sn-protoporphyrin IX (SnPPIX) directly inactivate DENV and YFV infectious particles. Here we demonstrate that the antiviral activity of these porphyrins can be broadened to CHIKV, ZIKV, Mayaro virus, Sindb is virus and Vesicular Stomatitis virus. Porphyrin treatment causes viral envelope protein loss, affecting viral morphology, adsorption and entry into target cells (Neris 2018)\n\nThe sulfonated tetranaphthyl porphyrin (TNapPS), sulfonated tetra-anthracenyl porphyrin (TAnthPS), and sulfonated 2,6-difluoro-meso-tetraphenylporphine [TPP(2,6-F2)S] and its copper chelate [TPP(2,6-F2)S,Cu], which reduced HIV infection by 99, 96, 94, and 96%, respectively (Andrei 2002)\n\nTreatment of HepG2 cells with heme, CoPPIX and SnPPIX after DENV infection reduced infectious particles without affecting viral RNA contents in infected cells. The reduction of viral load occurs only with the direct contact of DENV with porphyrins, suggesting a direct effect on viral particles. Previously incubation of DENV and YFV with heme, CoPPIX and SnPPIX resulted in viral particles inactivation in a dose-dependent manner. Biliverdin, a noncyclical porphyrin, was unable to inactivate the viruses tested. Infection of HepG2 cells with porphyrin-pretreated DENV2 results in a reduced or abolished viral protein synthesis, RNA replication and cell death. Treatment of HepG2 or THP-1 cell lineage with heme or CoPPIX after DENV infection with a very low MOI resulted in a decreased DENV replication and protection from death. (Assunção 2016)\n\nsummary In summary, SARS-CoV-2 would not be the first known virus to alter porphyrin metabolism; hepatitis C virus (Hep C) and human immunodeficiency virus(HIV) infection lead to a non-acute form of porphyria (Blauvelt 1996). So the principal investigator expects and suggests that porphyrin based therapy is suitable and effective treatment against COVID-19 and could Protects hemoglobin and RBCs from dangerous influence of COVID-19 .The possibility of therapeutic application of porphyrins or their use as models to design new antiviral drugs against DENV ,COVID -19 and YFV.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04371822","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

So far, over 2,000,000 cases have been reported around the globe with >150,000 reported deaths overwhelming hospitals and constraining resources. Death is mainly due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), requiring mechanical ventilation; however, many hospitals do not have sufficient equipment (i.e. ventilators) to meet the requirements. It had been suggested that severe SARS-related injury may have be related to an excessive reaction of the host's immune system, and a dysregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines called cytokine storm syndrome. This is characterized by a hyper-inflammatory state leading to fulminant multi-organ failure and elevated cytokine levels. There is a critical and imminent need to identify effective treatments to reduce mortality.\n\nThe study team proposes to use slow low-efficiency daily dialysis (SLEDD) to provide an extracorporeal circuit to target this cytokine storm using immunomodulation of neutrophils with a novel leukocyte modulatory device (L-MOD) to generate an anti-inflammatory phenotype, without depletion of circulating factors.\n\nThis is a single centre, prospective, randomized controlled pilot study in the Critical Care Trauma Centre at Victoria Hospital, London, Ontario.

Since first patients were detected in Wuhan China, in December 2019, COVID-19 has spread quickly worldwide, being a severe threat to public health. Fever, dry cough, shortness of breath and breathing distress are the main characteristics of COVID-19 infection. Some patients develop overwhelming lung inflammation and acute respiratory failure, for which there is no specific therapy. Therefore, safe and effective treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia is utterly necessary, mainly in critical cases. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been widely used in the immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. MSCs can regulate both innate and adaptive immunity by suppressing the proliferation, differentiation and activation of different cells.

Several reports demonstrated that COVID-19 specifically recognized the angiotensin I converting ezyme 2 repector (ACE2) and ACE2-positive cells are infected by the virus. ACE2 receptor is widely present on the human cells surface such as alveolar type II cells and capillary endothelium, among others. COVID-19 infects cells and stimulates a terrible cytokine storm in the lung followed by edema, dysfunction of the air exchange and acute respiratory distress which may lead to death. Further, once COVID-19 enters in blood circulation, it can easy spread to some systems and organs, causing significant damage.

This new disease was named COVID-19 and the causative virus SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 virus, enters the airway and binds, by means of the S protein on its surface to the membrane protein ACE2 in type 2 alveolar cells. The S protein-ACE2 complex is internalized by endocytosis leading to a partial decrease or total loss of the enzymatic function ACE2 in the alveolar cells and in turn increasing the tissue concentration of pro-inflammatory angiotensin II by decreasing its degradation and reducing the concentration of its physiological antagonist angiotensin 1-7. High levels of angiotensin II on the lung interstitium can promote apoptosis initiating an inflammatory process with release of proinflammatory cytokines, establishing a self-powered cascade, leading eventually to ARDS. It has recently been proposed the tentative use of agents such as losartan and telmisartan as alternative options for treating COVID-19 patients prior to development of ARDS. The present study is an open-label randomized phase II clinical trial for the evaluation of telmisartan in COVID-19 patients. Briefly, patients with confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, will be randomized to receive 80 mg/12h of telmisartan plus standard care or standard care alone and will be monitored for development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Other variables regarding lung function, systemic inflammation and cardiovascular function will also be evaluated.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nIn late 2019, a new coronavirus emerged in Wuhan Province, China, causing lung complications similar to those produced by the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in the 2002-2003 epidemic. This new disease was named COVID-19 and the causative virus SARS-CoV-2 (Chen, Liu, & Guo, 2020; Li et al., 2020).\n\nGiven that vaccines against COVID-19 are still in development and an effective treatment against this new coronavirus is lacking, various pharmacological agents are being tested in clinical trials designed by institutions such as the WHO or scientific entities in different countries (C.-C. Lu, Chen, & Chang, 2020).\n\nTaking into account the characteristics of the mode of entry of this coronavirus to human cells through binding with Angiotensin Converting Enzime 2 (ACE2) and extensive scientific and clinical evidence information on the Renin Angiotensin System, the hypothesis of the involvement of this system in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 was born (Gurwitz, 2020; Vaduganathan et al., 2020).\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus, enters the airway and binds, by means of the S (Spike) protein on its surface (after whose image the term coronavirus is coined), to the membrane protein ACE2 in type 2 alveolar cells (R. Lu et al., 2020; Wan, Shang, Graham, Baric, & Li, 2020). The S protein-ACE2 complex is internalized by endocytosis and facilitates the entry of each virion into the cytoplasm. For each intracellular entry, the function of one ACE2 molecule is lost leading to a partial decrease or total loss of the enzymatic function ACE2 in the alveolar cells of the lung directly related to the viral load of the air inoculum.\n\nACE2 catalyzes the transformation of angiotensin II into angiotensin 1-7. Angiotensin II acting on AT1 receptors causes vasoconstriction, apoptosis, proinflammatory effects, and fibrosis. Angiotensin 1-7 acting on Mas receptors causes opposite effects: vasodilation and anti-inflammatory. Partial decrease or total loss of ACE2 function in alveolar cells results in a deviation of the homeostatic balance of the Renin Angiotensin System in favor of the angiotensin II-AT1 receptor axis (Paz Ocaranza et al., 2020; Tikellis, Bernardi, & Burns, 2011). Indeed, it increases the tissue concentration of angiotensin II by decreasing its degradation and reduces the concentration of its physiological antagonist angiotensin 1-7(Liu et al., 2020).\n\nThe clinical manifestations of COVID-19 disease will depend fundamentally on the degree of alteration of the homeostatic balance of the Renin Angiotensin System in the lung and at the systemic level (mainly at the heart).\n\nIncreasing the effects of angiotensin II on the lung interstitium can promote apoptosis, which, in turn, initiates an inflammatory process with release of proinflammatory cytokines, establishing a self-powered cascade (Cardoso et al., 2018). In certain patients this process reaches such clinical relevance that requires external oxygen supply and in severe cases an Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) ensues (this correlates with an acute release -storm- of cytokines) (Ware & Matthay, 2000).\n\nBased on the aetiopathogenic hypothesis described, there are various pharmacotherapeutic proposals to be evaluated through clinical trials: Recombinant ACE2 therapy, administration of agents aimed at increasing ACE2 levels (e.g. estradiol), and administration of drugs that decrease the elevated activity of angiotensin II including renin release inhibitors, classic ACE inhibitors or Angiotensin Receptor 1 Blockers (ARBs).\n\nMost patients who develop COVID-19 disease initially have fever, indicative ofan inflammatory process with systemic release of pyrogenic cytokines. According to the hypothesis described, this inflammation is induced by the inhibition of ACE2 and the imbalance of the renin angiotensin system in the pulmonary interstitium in favor of the angiotensin II-AT1 receptor axis. Faced with the onset of the inflammatory process, a rapidly effective treatment is necessary to antagonize the cascading and self-sustaining phenomenon described. Of the different types of drugs mentioned above, we consider that the most rapidly effective may be ARBs.\n\nRecently, Gurwitz (2020) proposed the tentative use of agents such as losartan and telmisartan as alternative options for treating COVID-19 patients prior to development of ARDS.\n\nARBs are widely used to treat hypertension and there is an abundant clinical experience with its use, all representatives of this group being characterized by their excellent tolerance; Furthermore, its adverse effects profile has been described as \"placebo like(Schumacher & Mancia, 2008; Sharpe, Jarvis, & Goa, 2001).\n\nThe most suitable ARB to antagonize the proinflammatory effects of angiotensin II in a patient with a recent positive COVID-19 test should be the compound with the best pharmacological properties for this indication. From the comparative analysis of the available ARBs, telmisartan gathers properties that make it the best pharmacological tool to evaluate the hypothesis under discussion in a clinical trial.\n\nLiposolubility is relevant for absorption after oral administration and for tissue penetration. Telmisartan stands out among all the representatives of the ARBs for being markedly more lipophilic, expressed both in partition coefficients (octanol / neutral pH buffer), distribution coefficients and distribution volumes (Vd). Telmisartan has a Vd of approximately 500 L, irbesartan 93 L, and both valsartan and olmesartan, candesartan and losartan, approximately 17 L.\n\nThe affinity of ARBs for the AT1 receptor has been measured by multiple studies, mainly using radioligand binding studies. All AT1 receptor blockers are characterized by having similar affinity values (pKi or pIC50, between 2 and 19 nM), with losartan and its active metabolite EXP3174 being the lowest and irbesartan, candesartan and telmisartan the highest (Kakuta, Sudoh, Sasamata, & Yamagishi, 2005).\n\nUsing isolated organ technique on blood vessels from different tissues and from different animals, these AT1 antagonists have a blocking power (pA2) against angiotensin II in the nM range (losartan, 8.15; irbesartan, 8.52; valsartan, 9.26; telmisartan 9.48; candesartan, 10.08). Telmisartan has a 10-fold higher blocking potency than losartan (Kakuta et al., 2005).\n\nFunctional as well as biochemical studies determining the dissociation rates of the ARBs have shown that these drugs have a slow dissociation rate that gives them characteristics of pseudo-irreversible blocking agents. In the only comparative study using cloned human AT1 receptors, the half-lives of receptor dissociation were: telmisartan, 213 min; olmesartan, 166 min; candesartan, 133 min; valsartan, 70 min; losartan, 67 min (Kakuta et al., 2005). Telmisartan is the AT1 blocker that dissociates more slowly from the receptor. This property may be clinically relevant as it maintains a longer lasting blockade difficult to reverse by the endogenous agonist angiotensin II.\n\nFurthermore, telmisartan causes downregulation of AT1 receptor at the mRNA and protein level apparently due to its action as a partial agonist of PPAR-gamma (Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma). This action can contribute to the effects of telmisartan by producing a decrease in the number of AT1 receptors (Imayama et al., 2006).\n\nIn summary, telmisartan, which is well absorbed after oral administration, is the ARB with the longest plasma half-life (24 h), it reaches the highest tissue concentrations due to its high lipid solubility and high volume of distribution (500 L), and dissociates more slowly after binding to the AT1 receptor, causing an apparently irreversible block (Kakuta et al., 2005; Michel, Foster, Brunner, & Liu, 2013).\n\nThe present study is an open-label randomized phase II clinical trial for the evaluation of telmisartan in COVID-19 patients. Briefly, patients with confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, will be randomized to receive 80 mg/12h of telmisartan (Bertel®, Laboratorio Elea Phoenix, Buenos Aires, Argentina) plus standard care or standard care alone and will be monitored for development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Other variables regarding lung function, systemic inflammation and cardiovascular function will also be evaluated.\n\nClinical studies to evaluate the safety of Telmisartan in healthy individuals or in hypertensive patients with daily doses of up to 160 mg, found no difference between those treated with telmisartan and the placebo group in frequency and intensity of adverse effects (Schumacher & Mancia, 2008; Sharpe et al., 2001; Stangier, Su, & Roth, 2000).","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04355936","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

So even in the absence of evidence of effectiveness, the SCs are used for COVID-19 oxygen-dependent patients or with an ARDS. However, their benefit / risk remains debated (Russel 2020). On histological samples of COVID-19, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) has been especially observed (Hanley 2020). DAD is described histologically in an exudative phase, an organizational phase and a irreversible fibrotic phase (Hughes 2017). SC could have an effect beneficial by limiting the exudative / inflammatory phase but also that organization whose histological and CT aspects are sometimes indistinguishable from organized pneumonia, a form of pulmonary repair aberrant very corticosensitive (Travis 2013). Chest scans performed in the face of the persistence or worsening of oxygen dependence beyond the 7th day of COVID-19 symptoms, could help discern indirect complications (pulmonary embolism, exacerbation of COPD, bacterial superinfection, etc.) of an unfavorable course COVID-19 (by displaying an aspect suggesting DAD in particular during the organization phase). We hypothesize that, in the context of COVID-19, the SCs may be beneficial in patients with CT scans thoracic images suggestive of DAD either at the exudative phase or at the pulmonary organization phase.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04359511","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

The COVID19 is much more dangerous for people over 60 with a death rate of 3.6% after 60, 8.0% after 70 and 14.8% after 80 -and according to our Italian colleagues over 20% after 90- against 2.3% in the general population. The elderly patients who died most often had multiple comorbidities and in particular: cardiovascular disease (10.5% mortality), diabetes (7.3%), chronic respiratory disease (6.3%) and hypertension (6%). These elderly patients with COVID19 are therefore very fragile and require treatment that fights the virus but is also adapted to their state of health and age. Most of current therapeutic trials worldwide exclude people aged over 75 years, which is precisely the age group affected by COVID19. We therefore propose to carry out a therapeutic trial specific to the elderly with drugs at doses that are bearable for these patients. Using the WHO, clinicaltrial, pubmed and the Chinese CCDC/CHCTR websites to find the better drugs adapted to elderly people, we decided after concertation between infectiologists and geriatricians to do a four arms clinical trial during two weeks twice a day: Hydroxychloroquine 200mg, Telmisartan 40mg, Azithromycin 250mg and standard care. We therefore hypothesize that one or more of these treatments may have a beneficial effect in controlling COVID19, without major and repeated side effects in elderly patients.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nIn the absence of a validated treatment, any patient over 75 years -or demented above 60- of age arriving in one of our hospital centres with a COVID19 infection objectified by RT-PCR will be offered this therapeutic trial. Patients will be randomized. During their hospitalization, they will be closely monitored clinically. It means daily evaluation of temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, blood pressure, need for oxygen therapy and general clinical examination. The lung severity scale and WHO scale will be done daily. Any side effects of any kind, in particular serious side effects will be reported within 24 hours on the electronic CRF. RT-PCR with search for SARS-Cov-2 will be evaluated at D0, D7 and D14. A blood sample will be taken at D0, D7 and D14 with blood count, CRP and biobanking. Functional scales (ADL, confusion scale, walking) will be evaluated every 3 days. If death occurs, the precise circumstances and time of death will be transmitted, as well as the precise origin of death: only COVID19 or other associated disease (bacterial infection, heart failure, kidney failure, etc...).\n\nSymptomatic treatment will be at the discretion of the clinician, but will be recorded in the eCRF, particularly in relation to the use of corticosteroids or other immunomodulators.\n\nThe study will consist of 1600 patients over 75 years of age (or above 60 demented) with COVID19 requiring hospitalization, equally divided into four groups with the following treatment during two weeks for each arm:\n\nHydroxychloroquine 200mg twice a day\nAzithromycin 250 mg twice a day\nTelmisartan 40mg twice a day\nStandard care\n\nThe choice of these three drugs was done considering the benefit-risk balance, i.e. by choosing drugs with few side effects but high potential for elderly people (including severe renal insufficiency). Hydroxychloroquine was chosen because 1. This drug was demonstrated to be potent and more potent than Chloroquine at inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. An unpublished clinical trial with 100 patients showing superiority of chloroquine compared to placebo with improvement of lung image findings, promotion a virus-negative conversion and shortening the disease course . An open-label non randomized clinical trial with 42 patients showing a faster reduction of the virus in the Hydroxychloroquine treated group. Azithromycin was associated in the previous trial with Hydroxychloroquine with positive results on RT-PCR. Recently bioinformatic analysis conclude to SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibition with Macrolides. Moreover macrolides are known to have immunomodulatory effects, which could be of interest in the context of hyperinflammation. Telmisartan is an angiotensin 2 AT1 receptor antagonist. COVID19 use ACE2 as a receptor, a modulator of the activity of different angiotensin. The COVID19-ACE2 interaction increases the activity of angiotensin and thus increases the activity of the AT1 receptor, that results in increased pulmonary vascular permeability and therefore contributes to lung injury. Thus Telmisartan could be a protector against lung injury due to Sars-Cov-2, inhibiting AT1 receptor.\n\nThe expected benefits are multiple thanks to this original project:\n\n1. There is a research emergency. No drug has been shown to be really effective against COVID19 and even less in the elderly, so therapeutic trials are needed.\n2. If one of these 3 drugs turns out to be positive, it could even be taken at a very early stage, for example as a result of a recent contagion, in elderly population at high risk of death.\n3. If one of the three treatments was positive, the cost-effectiveness would be very favorable compared to other treatments currently being tested. This could benefit a larger population, particularly in developing countries where COVID19 is arriving.\n4. This trial will be evolutionary, i.e. we will be able to add a treatment arm if a new molecule that is potentially effective in the elderly appears.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04359953","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

This study will be a prospective, open-label, randomized controlled trial. A total of 100 patients scheduled for elective surgery will be randomly assigned in two groups (intervention group and control group). Participating attending anesthesiologists will intubate the intervention group patients with COVID barrier box and the control group patients without the box. The anesthesiologists and the intervention group patients will be surveyed about their perception after the surgery. The result of this study will help in decision making about using COVID barrier box to minimize the viral transmission from patients to healthcare workers during the pandemic.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nPurpose:\n\nTo assess the time to tracheal intubation (TTI) and first-pass success rate for attending anesthesiologists intubating with COVID-related modifications with or without the use of a COVID barrier box.\n\nHypothesis:\n\nUsing a COVID barrier box for tracheal intubation with COVID-related modifications for attending anesthesiologists would be prolonged compared to not using one.\n\nJustification:\n\nTracheal intubation is a high-risk time point for attending anesthesiologists to contract COVID. This risk can be minimized by using a proprietary barrier enclosure, COVID barrier box covering a patient's head and neck during intubation. It is crucial to estimate the intubation time and first-pass success rate of using a COVID barrier box for introducing it to intubate critically ill COVID patients. The finding of this study can lead to a ground-breaking measure to minimize viral transmission to healthcare workers during the pandemic.\n\nObjectives:\n\nThe primary objective of the study is to determine the TTI as measured by an observer. The secondary objectives are to assess the first-pass success rate, the total time of airway manipulation, as well as anesthesiologists' perception of intubation difficulty, and patients' satisfaction.\n\nResearch Design:\n\nThis study will be a prospective, open-label, randomized controlled trial.

Patients will be randomly assigned to the two arms of the study and after completing the course of treatment and collecting and analyzing the necessary information from each patient, the results of the study will be published both on this site and in the form of an article in a reputable international journal.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nUmifenovir is a component derived from indole, which has showed positive efficacy in inhibition of virus-to-host cell attachment in different groups of influenza, and type C hepatitis virus. Another study in 2008 also corroborated the anti-viral effect of Arbidol on SARS-CoV in the cell cultures. Recent works of L. Deng and other colleagues in 11th march 2020 revealed that COVID-19 patients under the treatment of Arbidol Combined with LPV/r had a significant clinical improvement in comparison to patients administrated with LPV/r alone. A small trial has illustrated that COVID-19 infected cases who were treated by Arbidol had an impressive reduction in fatality rate along with a better efficacy of treatment, in comparison with those administrated with Kaletra. Nevertheless, it is still needed to do further research on the effectivity of Arbidol specifically in much larger populations, so there can be a more solid conclusion ensured.\n\nAccording to previous studies, IFN-β, amongst IFN-1s, has strong antiviral activity and also has an acceptable safety profile. Based on possible therapeutic effects, We decided to lead An Investigation into Beneficial Effects of Interferon Beta 1a, Compared to Interferon Beta 1b And The Base Therapeutic Regiment in Moderate to Severe COVID-19. In a 2003 study, SARS was treated with different human interferons and found that IFN-β was 5 to 10 times more effective than other types of interferons and the strongest antiviral drug possible against SARS-CoV.\n\nChloroquine has been a broadly-utilized anti-malaria agent which back in 2006, had been proved to be a powerful wide-spectrum antiviral. Moreover, Chloroquine has the characteristics of anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory by inhibiting the production of TNF-α along with IL-6. In the first half of February, a study illustrated puissant inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by Chloroquine, when taking two 500-mg tablets of it by mouth per day; similar to some clinical studies in China through this outbreak. According to the news briefing of a study, it was indicated that chloroquine phosphate actually outdo the control treatment in inhibition of pneumonia exacerbation, improving lung imaging findings, and curtailing the disease course. Another study evaluated the possible doses of CQ and HCQ to find the optimized dose in treatment of COVID-19. They revealed that while within in-vitro settings Hydroxychloroquine is more potent than chloroquine. As a conclusion, they suggested a 800 mg daily dose of hydroxychloroquine, followed by an overall maintenance dose of 400 mg per day divided in two separate doses, which was three-fold more potent compared to the 500 mg twice daily administration of chloroquine in 5 days. The new study published in 16th March, pointed out that hydroxychloroquine was notably effectual in eradicating SARS-CoV-2 from the nasopharynx. Currently the evidence is quite inconclusive about the effectiveness or comparative effectiveness of either HCQ or CQ. Moreover, CQ has recently become scarce and even unavailable for ordering due to a huge demand for it, all because of a significant interest gained as a potential medicinal alternative for the management of COVID-19. In spite of all, the primary experience in China and France is propitious for the potential role of chloroquine, or alternatively hydroxychloroquine, for managing COVID-19.\n\nLopinavir, classified in the drug group of protease inhibitors, is utilized for the treatment of patients affected prolongedly with HIV-1. The mechanism by which Lopinavir acts is blocking the main protease of SARS-CoV-1, resulting in inhibition of viral replication. Real-world information supporting the treatment of COVID-19 with LPV/r keep coming out. Others have discovered that LPV/r has an anti-SARS-CoV effect within both in-vitro settings and clinical studies. In disclosed results of Young and colleagues' research on COVID-19 patients in Singapore, 5 cases received LPV/r monotherapy. Among those 5 patients, 3 had decrease in oxygen requirements after treatment, while the other 2 had their conditions worsened to the point of respiratory failure. Other published evaluations from Korea and China made up of a total of 6 patients, show reduced viral load, and clinical improvement after onset of LPV/r treatment. Latterly, Cao and colleagues illustrated the results of comparing twice a day use of LPV/r 400/100 mg to standard care, for treating the pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2. This study's upshot, demonstrated no benefit regarding a lopinavir-ritonavir treatment beyond standard care. Considering the currently available data, it is yet to be determined whether LPV/r could significantly affect the status of COVID-19 patients, either as monotherapy or in combination-therapy. Moreover, close monitoring is needed during the administration of this drug, because particularly elevated levels of AST or ALT suggesting the gastrointestinal complications and hepatoxicity may exclude patients with COVID-19 from clinical trials.\n\nThe present study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial, with the approval of the ethics committee will be conducted on patients who have a positive test confirming COVID-19 in Loghman Hakim Medical Education Center in Tehran.

The trial will statistically compare the clinical benefit afforded by the two treatment strategies to internal historical \"standard of care\" data from Northwell patents treated without benefit of either hydroxychloroquine or high-dose famotidine. We will compare clinical outcomes associated with hydroxychloroquine and the addition of high-dose intravascular famotidine. The trial is designed to enroll at least 600 COVID-19 patients hospitalized with moderate to severe disease into each of the two active treatment arms, with a total enrollment target of at least 1200 patients. The proposed trial has been designed for rapid enrollment and completion and powered to support two interim analyses that will enable prompt assessment of benefits and risks of the two treatment groups while maintaining the rigorous gold standard of a randomized double blind clinical trial structure. Trial design has been guided by practical consideration of the current clinical context involving rapidly escalating demands on hospital staff and resources, and incorporates a minimalist approach employing existing laboratory information management systems and a clinically relevant binary primary outcome of 30-day endpoint of death or survival.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nIn December 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Committee identified an outbreak of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause. Coronavirus RNA was quickly identified in these patients. This novel coronavirus has been designated SARS-CoV-2, and the disease caused by this virus has been designated COVID-19 and has infected hundreds of thousands of confirmed individuals in more than 200 countries. Currently there are no approved therapeutic agents available for coronaviruses. There is an urgent need for an effective treatment to treat symptomatic patients but also to decrease the duration of virus transmission in the community. Among candidate drugs to treat COVID-19, repurposing of FDA-approved drugs for use as antiviral treatments is proposed because knowledge on safety profile, side effects, and drug interactions are well known. A clinical trial conducted in COVID-19 Chinese patients showed that chloroquine had a significant effect, both in terms of clinical outcome and viral clearance, when comparing to controls groups. Chinese experts recommend that patients diagnosed as mild, moderate and severe cases of COVID-19 pneumonia and without contraindications to chloroquine, be treated with 500 mg chloroquine twice a day for ten days. Hydroxychloroquine (an analog of chloroquine) has been demonstrated to have an anti-SARS-CoV activity in vitro. Hydroxychloroquine clinical safety profile is better than that of chloroquine (during long-term use) and allows higher daily dose and has fewer concerns about drug-drug interactions.\n\nGautret recently reported a clinical trial to assess the effect of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin on SARS-CoV-2-infected patients in France. Early results, focusing on virological data in twenty patients with upper and lower respiratory tract infections receiving hydroxychloroquine as compared to a control group, showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage after 6 days of treatment compared to controls, and much lower average carrying duration than reported of untreated patients in the literature. Azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination. The molecular mechanism of action of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine has not been fully elucidated but they are believed to change the pH at the surface of the cell membrane and thus, inhibit the fusion of the virus to the cell membrane, as well as inhibit nucleic acid replication, glycosylation of viral proteins, virus assembly, new virus particle transport, virus release and other processes to achieve its antiviral effects.\n\nYao et.al recently reported antiviral and prophylactic activity of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in vitro, concluding that hydroxychloroquine was more potent than chloroquine at inhibiting SARS CoV 2 in vitro and that hydroxychloroquine sulfate 400 mg given twice daily for day 1 (loading dose) followed by 200 mg twice daily for 4 more days is recommended to treat SARS CoV 2 infection.\n\nIn silico screening of FDA licensed compound libraries against the SARS CoV 2 protease Plpro catalytic site was performed using solved crystal structures of the protein. Plpro (Papain-like protease) is an early acting protease responsible for initial processing of the SARS CoV2 polyprotein into active subunits. Plpro also has ubiquitinase activity, and is implicated in early infection phase inhibition of innate (interferon) immune responses which otherwise would suppress viral replication. A ranked list of licensed compounds with predicted binding activity in the Plpro catalytic site was computationally generated, and the Plpro catalytic site binding pose of each of the top compounds was examined and ranked by a team of pharmaceutical chemists. Package inserts or product monographs for the licensed compounds which generated high computational binding scores and passed inspection were then reviewed and used to rank compounds based on adverse events, warnings, drug interactions on-target mechanisms, pharmacokinetic and absorption, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET), protein binding and available therapeutic window considerations. Famotidine (Pepcid), a histamine H2 antagonist widely available over-the-counter, was repeatedly computationally scored among the highest of the compounds tested, and was associated with the most favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profile. A series of analogs of famotidine were generated using PubChem, and many of these scored even higher as potential candidates. This control compound set further confirmed the predicted binding of the molecular backbone chemotype at the Plpro protease/ubiquitinase site. Currently available as oral and IV products, famotidine has a very attractive proven safety, drug interaction, and therapeutic window profile. Samples of famotidine have been submitted at Southern Research and IITRI for in vitro testing in COVID-19 cultures. Unpublished anecdotal case studies suggest clinical benefits associated with administration of famotidine 40 mg PO TID in mild COVID-19 infection.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04370262","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

This virus is responsible for an epidemic in Wuhan in November 2019 and a pandemic in March 2020. The mode of transmission, both respiratory and by contact, carried by microdroplets emitted by an infected person and inhaled by a person nearby, induces a very high contagiousness rate2. In the majority of cases, CoV-2-SARS infection is not very symptomatic, but some evolve into severe forms, particularly in frail people: elderly subjects, those affected by chronic diseases (diabetes, obesity or cancer) or those undergoing immunosuppressive treatments. There is still little information on the reasons why some will develop a severe form while others will remain asymptomatic. The immune response is little studied in this context.\n\nFunctional study of the cellular immune response has shown its interest in predicting the risk of infection in different cohorts, particularly in renal insufficiency subjects awaiting transplantation with an over-risk of developing an infection within a year in patients with a low level of gamma interferon (INFγ: main anti-viral cytokine) after non-specific stimulation of T lymphocytes.\n\nA study published the clinical characteristics of 41 patients infected with coronavirus at the Huanan seafood market (first contact cases). Despite a similar clinical symptomatology: cough (76%) and fever (98%), some patients required rapid ventilatory assistance. These patients had an increased production of inflammatory cytokines: IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα3.\n\nHere, the objective is to identify cytokine profiles in subjects exposed to or infected with SARS-CoV-2 that can predict their risk of developing a severe pauci-symptomatic form at the time of exposure or during the development of a severe form. the team believes that the immune response to this infection is a major factor in the risk of developing an asymptomatic infection, a flu-like symptomatology or a respiratory failure syndrome (ARDS).3,4 The team believes that the immune response to this infection is a major factor in the risk of developing an asymptomatic infection, a flu-like symptomatology or a respiratory failure syndrome (ARDS). The team thus wishes to better direct patients to appropriate care structures to optimise the care pathway (ambulatory, infectiology, intensive care), respirators and number of beds so as not to overload the staff) and to enable treatments to be personalised and adapted as best as possible: corticosteroids, immunomodulators, antivirals.\n\nThe study will be based on 2 axes: a first clinical axis (i) and a cellular axis (ii).\n\nIn its clinical part (i), the intensity of the immune response in COVID19 subjects presenting different forms of the disease (asymptomatic, moderate and severe forms) will be measured. These subjects will be recruited from two different patient populations:\n\nSubjects at risk of infection with CoV-2-SARS. We will test the Th1 response of caregivers at the time of their entry into a COVID-19 service by measuring the level of INFγ released after non-specific T-cell stimulation. The hypothesis is that a high level of INFγ at the time of exposure prevents the risk of developing severe disease and directs the patient towards less symptomatic forms. Thus, thanks to serological tests, it will be possible to determine retrospectively in this group how many subjects presented an asymptomatic form and thus to determine with the help of a functional test mimicking a viral infection the level of IFNγ measured after stimulation.\nPatients with CoV-2-SARS infection hospitalized in the Infectious Diseases Department with a moderate form or in resuscitation with a severe form of COVID.19 The evaluation of these patients on admission using a functional test mimicking a viral infection the rate of IFNγ measured after stimulation will be carried out.\n\nThe levels of IFNγ measured after stimulation will be compared in these 3 groups of COVID19 patients if the evolution towards inflammatory cytokinic profiles at D0, D5 and D10 can predict the risk of developing ARDS...\n\nThen, the impact of different therapeutic interventions on the secretion of INFγ will be tested in vitro in an ancillary study (ii): anti-inflammatory, corticosteroids, anti-IL6, IL2, IL7, chloroquine on their capacity to produce anti-viral cytokines of the type INFγ on different T cells while limiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by cells of innate immunity, from healthy subjects, COVID-19 subjects with a mildly symptomatic form or COVID-19 subjects with ARDS.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04355351","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Based on possible therapeutic effects, We decided to lead An Investigation into Beneficial Effects of Interferon Beta 1a, Compared to Interferon Beta 1b And The Base Therapeutic Regiment in Moderate to Severe COVID-19. In a 2003 study, SARS was treated with different human interferons and found that IFN-β was 5 to 10 times more effective than other types of interferons and the strongest antiviral drug possible against SARS-CoV.\n\nChloroquine has been a broadly-utilized anti-malaria agent which back in 2006, had been proved to be a powerful wide-spectrum antiviral. Moreover, Chloroquine has the characteristics of anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory by inhibiting the production of TNF-α along with IL-6. In the first half of February, Wang et al illustrated puissant inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by Chloroquine, when taking two 500-mg tablets of it by mouth per day; similar to some clinical studies in China through this outbreak. According to the news briefing of works of Per Gao et al., it was indicated that chloroquine phosphate actually outdo the control treatment in inhibition of pneumonia exacerbation, improving lung imaging findings, and curtailing the disease course. X. Yao et al. evaluated the possible doses of CQ and HCQ to find the optimized dose in treatment of COVID-19. They revealed that while within in-vitro settings Hydroxychloroquine is more potent than chloroquine. As a conclusion, they suggested a 800 mg daily dose of hydroxychloroquine, followed by an overall maintenance dose of 400 mg per day divided in two separate doses, which was three-fold more potent compared to the 500 mg twice daily administration of chloroquine in 5 days. The new study of Gautret et al. published in 16th March, pointed out that hydroxychloroquine was notably effectual in eradicating SARS-CoV-2 from the nasopharynx. Currently the evidence is quite inconclusive about the effectiveness or comparative effectiveness of either HCQ or CQ. Moreover, CQ has recently become scarce and even unavailable for ordering due to a huge demand for it, all because of a significant interest gained as a potential medicinal alternative for the management of COVID-19. In spite of all, the primary experience in China and France is propitious for the potential role of chloroquine, or alternatively hydroxychloroquine, for managing COVID-19.\n\nLopinavir, classified in the drug group of protease inhibitors, is utilized for the treatment of patients affected prolongedly with HIV-1. The mechanism by which Lopinavir acts is blocking the main protease of SARS-CoV-1, resulting in inhibition of viral replication. Real-world information supporting the treatment of COVID-19 with LPV/r keep coming out. Chu et al. have discovered that LPV/r has an anti-SARS-CoV effect within both in-vitro settings and clinical studies. In disclosed results of Young and colleagues' research on COVID-19 patients in Singapore, 5 cases received LPV/r monotherapy. Among those 5 patients, 3 had decrease in oxygen requirements after treatment, while the other 2 had their conditions worsened to the point of respiratory failure. Other published evaluations from Korea and China made up of a total of 6 patients, show reduced viral load, and clinical improvement after onset of LPV/r treatment. Latterly, Cao and colleagues illustrated the results of comparing twice a day use of LPV/r 400/100 mg to standard care, for treating the pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2. This study's upshot, demonstrated no benefit regarding a lopinavir-ritonavir treatment beyond standard care. Considering the currently available data, it is yet to be determined whether LPV/r could significantly affect the status of COVID-19 patients, either as monotherapy or in combination-therapy. Moreover, close monitoring is needed during the administration of this drug, because particularly elevated levels of AST or ALT suggesting the gastrointestinal complications and hepatoxicity may exclude patients with COVID-19 from clinical trials.\n\nThe present study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial, with the approval of the ethics committee will be conducted on patients who have a positive test confirming COVID-19 in Loghman Hakim Medical Education Center in Tehran.

Here, the principal investigator reports according to previous studies and research findings that retinoic acid could strongly affect both inflammation and viral entry in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection via modulating and reducing cytokine storm factors (IL- 6,IL-1,IL-10 and tumor necrosis factors alpha ) which are over expressed in COVID 2019 infection and contribute to disease progression, poor outcomes and poor survival in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome(SARS-CoV-2) and also, via blocking viral entry by inhibition factor which induce Serine protease 2 expression rather than inhibition of ACE2 ,AT1 protein and Ang II-mediated intracellular calcium release pathway which is responsible for SARS-CoV-2 cell fusion and entry as opposed to medications that upregulate ACE-2 receptors might increase the risk of infection and subsequent complications.Retinoic acid which induce FOXP3 and CD8+,CD4+,CD25+,FOXP3+ Tregs which their absence during acute infection alters the ability of the host to limit tissue damage. and T cells which were dramatically reduced in COVID-19 patients to exert its antiviral and anti-inflammatory effect protecting lung cells and neural cells from the inflammatory and the destructive effect of IL-6. In addition to inducing retinoic acid inducible gene-1 (RIG-1) and endosomal toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) as pathogen-associated molecular patterns.

A key host cellular protein required for the virus entry is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) whose expression has been demonstrated in many tissues including alveolar epithelial type II cells in lungs, oral mucosa and intestine, heart, kidney, endothelium and skin. ACE2-expressing cells can act as home cells and are prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection as ACE2 receptor facilitates cellular viral entry and replication. A study demonestrated that patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus may be at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as these patients are often treated with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers (ARBs), which have been previously suggested to increase ACE2 expression. In another study by Sinha et al who analyzed a publicly available Connectivity Map (CMAP) dataset of pre/post transcriptomic profiles for drug treatment in cell lines for over 20,000 small molecules, isotretinoin was the strongest down-regulator of ACE 2 receptors. On the other hand, they found 6 drugs in CMAP that are currently being investigated in clinical trials for treating COVID-19 (chloroquine, thalidomide, methylprednisolone, losartan, lopinavir and ritonavir, from clinicaltrials.gov), none of which was found to significantly alter ACE2 expression (P>0.1) Moreover, another study demonstrated that isotretinoin is a Potential papain like protease (PLpro) inhibitors which is a protein encoded by SARS-CoV-2 genes and considered one of the proteins that should be targeted in COVID-19 treatment by performing target-based virtual ligand screening.As Principal Investigator discussed before that (13cRA) is the strongest down-regulator of ACE2. and the principal investigator expects that 13cRA can inhibit or dowenrgulat ACE2 by direc interaction and binding with the transmembrane ACE2, Suggesting its therapeutic potential in preventing the entry of COVID 2019 to the host cell.\n\nPrevious studies on the related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV FP FP have shown that calcium (Ca2+) plays an important role for fusogenic activity via a Ca2+ binding pocket with conserved glutamic acid (E) and aspartic acid (D) residuesdemonstrated that intracellular Ca2+ enhances MERS-CoV WT PPs infection by approximately two-fold and that E891 is a crucial residue for Ca2+interaction. Electron spin resonance revealed that this enhancement could be attributed to Ca2+ increasing MERS-CoV FP fusion-relevant membrane ordering. Intriguingly, isothermal calorimetry titration showed that MERS-CoV FP binds one Ca2+, as opposed to SARS-CoV FP which binds to two Ca2+ ion.\n\nAngiotensin II increases the intracellular calcium activity in podocytes of the intact glomerulus. The L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nicardipine did not influence the Ang II-mediated [Ca2+] increase and it has been postulated that SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 may attenuate residual ACE2 activity, skewing the ACE/ACE2 balance to a state of heightened angiotensin II activity leading to pulmonary vasoconstriction and inflammatory and oxidative organ damage, which increases the risk for acute lung injury (ALI). AngII via AT1 receptors upregulates many proinflammatory genes, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6).30 but 13cis RA specifically down-regulated the AT1 protein in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Down-regulation of the AT1 expression leads to reduced AngII-mediated intracellular calcium release Similarly with receptor down-regulation, Treatment with 13cRA resulted in a significant reduction in AT1 mRNA .13cRA has a glucose- and RAR/RXR independent mechanism for transcriptional inhibition of AT1,\n\nIsotretinoin(13cis RA) and ATRA may be able to inhibit COVID 2019 infection via inducing the antiviral immunity and this is discussed as follow :\n\nSince an effective immune response against viral infections depends on the activation of cytotoxic T cells that can clear infection by killing virus-infected cells , boosting the numbers and function of T cells in COVID-19 patients is critical for successful recovery. A recent study reported that the 82.1% of COVID-19 cases displayed low circulating lymphocyte counts. A CoV infects macrophages, and then macrophages present CoV antigens to T cells. This process leads to T cell activation and differentiation, including the production of cytokines associated with the different T cell subsets (Th17), followed by a massive release of cytokines for immune response amplification. The continued production of these mediators due to viral persistence has a negative effect on NK, and CD8 T cell activation. However, CD8 T cells produce very effective mediators to clear CoV However, the factors which might cause the reduction in count, and the activation status of T cells in COVID-19 patients, remain uninvestigated.\n\nRecent study of 522 COVID patients and 40 healthy controls from two hospitals in Wuhan, China demonstrated that T cell numbers are negatively correlated to serum IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α concentration, with patients in decline period showing reduced IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α concentrations and restored T cell counts. T cells from COVID-19 patients have significantly higher levels of the exhausted marker programmed cell death protein(PD-1) as compared to health controls. Moreover, increasing PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on T cells could be seen as patients progressed from prodromal to overtly symptomatic stages, further indicative of T cell exhaustion. T cell exhaustion is a progressive loss of effector function due to prolonged antigen stimulation, characteristic of chronic infections. Dendritic cell inhibition is connected to exhaustion of CD8+ T cell polyfunctionality during chronic hepatitis C virus infection. CD8 T cells produce very effective mediators to clear nCoV2019.\n\nDendritic cells (DCs) play a key role in innate immune and adaptive immune responses. As the strongest antigen presenting cells in the organism, they effectively stimulate the activation of T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes, thus combining innate and adaptive immunity. Immature DCs have strong migration ability, and mature DCs can effectively activate T cells in the central link of startup, regulation, and maintenance of immune responses. Thus, once the maturation process of DCs is blocked, it directly affects the initiation of subsequent adaptive immune response. MERS-CoV-2 is able to affect human dendritic cells and macrophages in-vitro .Productive replication of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in monocyte-derived dendritic cells modulates innate immune response.\n\nAnother study proposed that C -C chemokine receptor type 4 (CCR4) contributes to T cell lung homing imprinting. It was found that lung DCs induce the expression of CCR4 on T cells. Lung DCs-activated T cells traffic more efficiently into the lung and protect against influenza more effectively compared with T cells activated by DCs from other tissues. Lim and colleagues suggested that CXCR4 plays a role in CD8+ T cell migration to airway tissues\n\nDendritic cell inhibition is connected to exhaustion of CD8+ T cell polyfunctionality during chronic hepatitis C virus infection. CD8 T cells produce very effective mediators to clear nCoV2019\n\nPresence of RA in different tissues is very imprtant for immune induction and fighting viral infection, for example, RA is present at high concentrations in the small intestine due to metabolizing dietary vitamin A by gut epithelial cells. In this local environment, RA activate and primes dendritic cells (DCs) to become CD103+ DCs that produce RA.3, 4CD103+ DCs are migratory cells that activate naive T cells in mesenteric lymph nodes to become effector T cells that contribute to both intestinal homeostasis and immunity.and also RA is an important signal that induces IgA-producing B cells. The gut homing T cells and B cells play essential roles in protecting the digestive tract from pathogens.\n\nRetinoic acid (atRA) can inhibit the spontaneous apoptosis of activated human T lymphocytes in vitro. 13-cis RA activates Th2 cytokine production Enhanced circulating dendritic cell numbers.\n\nSo, according to this previous studies the principal investigator suggests that T cells lymphopenia and exhaustion may be resulted by Dendritic cells (DCs) infection and inhibition by MERS-CoV-2.\n\nRetinoic acid has profound effects on cellular proliferation and differentiation. Moreover, it has been reported that ATRA exhibits both anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects. Recent studies have shown that FOXP3 expression and the immune function of Regulatory T cells (Tregs ) can be enhanced by ATRA in the immune system of both patients and mic.13Retinoic acid (RA) is produced by a number of cell types, including macrophages and dendritic cells, which express retinal dehydrogenases that convert vitamin A to its main biologically active metabolite, all-trans RA. All-trans RA binds to its nuclear retinoic acid receptors that are expressed in lymphoid cells and act as transcription factors to regulate cell homing and differentiation. RA production by CD103+ dendritic cells and alveolar macrophages functions with TGF-b to promote conversion of naive T cells into Foxp3+ regulatory T cells and, thereby, maintain mucosal tolerance\n\nSo, principal investigator expects high inducing of Dendritic cells (DCs) by retinoic acid treatment which will lead to T cells activation and migration with less exhaustion phenomenon.\n\nAccording to this protocol treatment with retinoic acid will induce FOXP3 and CD8+,CD4+,CD25+,FOXP3+ Tregs which their absence during acute infection alters the ability of the host to limit tissue damage and inducesT cells which were dramatically reduced in COVID-19 patients to exert its antiviral and anti-inflammatory effect protecting lung cells and neural cells from the inflammatory and the destructive effect of IL-6, IL-1, and TNF-α which are induced and highly expressed in COVID 2019 patients.\n\nResearchers from Wenzhou, China looked at clinical laboratory features including lipid levels of patients with COVID 19. They found dramatic reductions in the cholesterol levels of patients infected with COVID 19, compared with healthy controls .The study provides data to suggest that cholesterol levels decline quite rapidly during the early stages of infection and increase as the patient starts to recover. Therefore, indicating that cholesterol may have an important role to play in defending the body against such infections According to our protocol depending on previous studies the principal investigator demonstrated that there is a strong relation between immune system and cholesterol levels .When the cholesterol level is low specifically in the case of viral infection like COVID 2019 infection the immune system is impaired and the antiviral immune cells will be declined and inhibited :-\n\nCellular cholesterol is a component of the plasma membrane and is also essential in cell proliferation. Regulation of intracellular cholesterol levels has been proposed as a mechanism to regulate T cell and macrophages proliferation. Intracellular cholesterol level is regulated by two competing pathways, cholesterol uptake and efflux, and ABCA1 plays a major role in the cholesterol efflux pathway. The ATRA induces ABCA1 expression and ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux in activated primary human CD4+ T cells implying that RA could affect T cell functions by regulating the cellular cholesterol levels.\n\nATRA upregulates ABCA1 expression only in activated CD4+ T cells, indicating that induction of ABCA1 by ATRA and 13 cis Retinoic Acid may play an important role in immune response.\n\nRetinoic acid and liver X receptor agonist synergistically inhibit HIV infection in CD4+ T cells by up-regulating ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux.\n\nSo, the principal investigator expects that retinoic acid treatment will highly induce T cells and anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells, T helper via cholesterol efflux and inducing ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABCA1) and protect lung and neural cells and inhibit COVID 2019 infection.\n\nThe genome of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus is recognized by melanoma differentiation-associated protein-5 (MDA5), retinoic acid inducible gene-1 (RIG-1) and endosomal toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) as pathogen-associated molecular patterns. This recognition resulted in the formation of type-1 interferon (IFN1). As an evasion mechanism, virus synthesize proteins that hinder the production IFN1 in the pathway.\n\nRA also acts directly on macrophages at both mucosal sites and other immunological sites. AtRA modulates peritoneal macrophage activation by endotoxin and IFN-γ by suppressing TNF production and nitric oxide (NO) synthesis .In addition, at RA inhibits the expression of PGE2 and COX-2 and the release of TNF, which are induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in murine peritoneal macrophages .\n\nA study reported recently that substance (ATRA) have preventive effects on pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting IL-6-dependent proliferation and TGF-β1-dependent trans differentiation of lung fibroblasts. Also, another studies demonstrated that 13-cis-retinoic acid and other retinoid analogs inhibit IL-1-induced IL-6 production and that this effect is analog-specific and, at least partially, transcriptionally mediated. This effect was dose-dependent with an IC50 of 10(-7) M RA and significant inhibition being noted with doses of RA as low as 10(-8) M. IL-10 production was inhibited by ATRA administration.\n\nA study demonstrated that TLR3(-/-), TLR4(-/-), and TRAM(-/-) mice are more susceptible to SARS-CoV than wild-type mice but experience only transient weight loss with no mortality in response to infection. In contrast, mice deficient in the TLR3/TLR4 adaptor TRIF are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV infection, showing increased weight loss, mortality, reduced lung function, increased lung pathology, and higher viral titers . New studies showed that the high level of IFN-α/β produced from the TLR3-IRF3/IRF7 pathway and IFN-β is the reason for inhibiting DENV replication. 13Cis retinoic Acid induced significant upregulation of toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) resulting in an immune response to dsRNA intermediate which can be partially generated during CoV-2 replicationTLR3 sensitized by dsRNA and cascades of signaling pathways (IRFs and NFκB activation, respectively) are activated to produce type I IFNs. The production of type I IFNs is important to enhance the release of antiviral proteins for the protection of uninfected cells. Sometimes, accessory proteins of CoV can interfere with TLR3 signaling and bind the dsRNA of CoV during replication to prevent TLR3 activation and evade the immune response. 13Cis retinoic Acid induced significant upregulation of toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) , mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and retinoid-induced gene I (RIG-I) and IFN regulatory factor 1 expression in a time-dependent.\n\nIn further research, Tsai .and Chen showed the high level of IFN-α/β produced from the TLR3-IRF3/IRF7 pathway and IFN-β is the reason for inhibiting DENV replication. In HUH-7 cells, huTLR3 can recognize DENV-1 and induce the expression of IFN-β, which can enhance the expression of huTLR3 on the contrary . TLR3 also induces type I IFN during WNV.\n\nDoctors treating the sickest Covid-19 patients have zeroed in on a new phenomenon: Some people have developed widespread blood clots, their lungs peppered with tiny blockages that prevent oxygen from pumping into the bloodstream and body.As with so much else about the Covid-19 response, health experts are learning about the symptom on the fly. Blood clots are common in patients who are immobilized, but they seem to be smaller and cause far more severe damage in some Covid-19 patients. Doctors have said they see patients with blood clots forming not only in their lungs, but also in blood vessels. Autopsies have also revealed blood clots in kidneys and other organs, which some experts say suggests an overwhelming immune system response to the virus that inflicts harm on the body\n\nRetinoic acid, is known to possess in vivo anti-inflammatory, anti-platelet and fibrinolytic activities. A study investigated the in vitro thrombin and platelet aggregation inhibitory activities of retinoic acid and retinaldehyde.Retinoic acid, retinaldehyde and retinol exhibited potent inhibition of thrombin, with IC50 values of 67μg/ml, 74μg/ml and 152μg/ml, respectively for the inhibition of thrombin (Sigma); and 49μg/ml, 74μg/ml and 178μg/ml, respectively for the inhibition of thrombin (plasma). Amongst vitamin A and its derivatives, retinoic acid showed the highest inhibition of both the forms of thrombin.\n\nIsotretinoin(13cis RA) may be able to inhibit COVID 2019 infection via reversIing the androgenic induction and activation effect of (DHT) on TMPRSS2 expression and helps to prevent cleaving and activating both the spike protein (S) of COVID 2019 and the viral receptor, and this is discussed as follow :\n\nTMPRSS2 is both the most frequently altered gene in primary prostate cancer and a critical factor enabling cellular infection by coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. The modulation of its expression by steroids could contribute to the male predominance of severe infections and given that TMPRSS2 has no known indispensable functions, and inhibitors are available, it is an appealing target for prevention or treatment of respiratory viral infections\n\nMPRSS2, a key regulatorin prostate cancerTMPRSS2 was first identified in prostate cancer shortly after the gene had been originally cloned. Prostate cancer cell linesstrongly upregulatedTMPRSS2expression in response to androgens . TMPRSS2 is expressed on the luminal side of the prostate epithelium, and its expression is increased in prostate cancer tissue compared to non-cancerous prostate tissue. Notably, the TMPRSS2gene is a partner in one of the most common gene fusion eventsin solid tumors: somatic gene rearrangements involving TMPRSS2 witha member of the ETS family of oncogenic transcription factors, most commonly ERG. This fusionoccursinapproximately 50% of primary prostate cancersamong men of European ancestry.While ERGis not normally regulated by androgen, the gene fusion juxtaposes the androgen receptor regulatory elements of TMPRSS2with the ERGgene. The ERGgene is consequently controlled by androgen receptor signaling and expressed highly in prostate cancers harboringthe TMPRSS2:ERGfusion. Intriguingly, the prevalence of the TMPRSS2:ERGfusion is lowerin prostate tumors of both black and Asian men. The relevance of this to the current COVID-19 pandemic is unclear.TMPRSS2:ERGfusion-positiveprostate cancersalso have a distinct set of risk factorsrelated to hormonal signaling. For example, men with higher genetically determined transcriptional activity of the androgen receptorhave a higher risk of TMPRSS2:ERGfusion-positiveprostate cancer but not of fusion-negativeprostate cancer\n\nTMPRSS2 is an androgen receptor signaling target gene and an androgen-regulated cell-surface serine protease expressed predominantly in prostate and lung epithelial cell TMPRSS2 is normally expressed several fold higher in the prostate relative to any other human tissue, though the normal physiological function(s) remains unknown. Importantly, unlike other TTSPs, TMPRSS2 transcription is regulated by androgenic ligands and the androgen receptor (AR). There is a positive correlation between AR and TMPRSS2 in microdissected primary tumor epithelium (r2 = 0.39 ; p <0.001).\n\nDihydrotestosterone (DHT) significantly and dramatically induced the expression of TMPRSS2 protein with two molecular masses of 60 (full-length) and 38 kDa (N-terminus) in a dose responsive manner\n\nData from Chinese outbreak show death rates for men almost 50 per cent higher than for women show that Early research from China suggests women and children are less likely to die than men if they catch the coronavirus. Death rates for Covid-19, the disease those infected with the coronavirus develop, are low for everyone: only 2.4 per cent of the 44,672 people in the Chinese study died. But although roughly even numbers of men and women catch the disease, men are more likely to develop such a serious case of Covid-19 they die.\n\nMore than 70 percent of Italy's coronavirus deaths have been among men but scientists there admit they are mystified by the gender gap. At least 3,400 people in Italy have died of the devastating disease - it yesterday announced it had a higher death Toll than China - but less than 1,000 of them have been women. Men are also more likely to pick up the infection in the first place and account for 60 percent of confirmed cases, according to Italy's public health research agency. An earlier analysis found that 80 per cent of the deaths were in men and just 20 per cent were in women - but the gap has narrowed over time\n\nAccording to this data the principal investigator thinks that there is a strong relation between high mortality in males and androgenic effect specifically the effect of DHT on TMPRSS2 protein which is used by covid 2019 in cell invasion and entry and depending on this data related to six hormones specifically (DHT) , The investigator was able to discover whey women and children less likely to die from illness than men. So, the investigator divided infected patients according to their six hormone because TMPRSS2 is an androgen-regulated cell-surface serine protease expressed predominantly in prostate and lung epithelial cell TMPRSS2.\n\nAndrogen(DHT) potential effect on TMPRSS2 expression in children is less than its effect in females and males followed by viral severity and vigrousity in men compared with children and women. .\n\nAndrogen (DHT) potential effect on TMPRSS2 expression in females is less than in males followed by viral severity and vigrousity in men compared with females .\n\nSo, the principal investigator thinks that when some researchers investigated the role of sex steroids in SARS-CoV pathogenesis by comparing gonadectomized and control counterparts after infection. Gonadectomy or treatment with flutamide, a non-steroidal anti-androgen did not affect morbidity and mortality in male mice following lethal MA15 infection, They may be were wrong in their conclusions in suggesting that androgens do not play a role in SARS-CoV pathogenesis because Gonadectomy or treatment with flutamide will not completely affect or inhibit DHT and its derivatives(5α-Androstan-3α,17β-Diol) concentration in tissues and blood because after inhibiting testosterone with flutamide . the pathway of DHT formation will be activated to compensate the inhibited testosterone levels so the TMPRSS2 expression will be significantly induced by DHT and the treated animals will not be affected in case of flutamide treatment but in case of Gonadectomy the expression of TMPRSS2 will be decreased by DHT inhibition only if along time has passed on Gonadectomy in order to make sure that DHT and its derivatives completely declined in levels that will not allow it to affect on expression of TMPRSS2 and in female mice after blocking estrogen receptors it died because increasing formation of androgenic hormones.\n\nA study demonstrated that 13- cis -Retinoic acid competitively and reversibly inhibits Dihydrotestosterone So, the principal investigator expects a significant modulation of TMPRSS2 expression after treating with 13- cis -Retinoic acid via temporary preventing the effect of dihydrotestosterone(DHT) on TMPRSS2 promoting and expression. And the type II transmembrane serine proteases TMPRSS2 which can cleave and activate the spike protein (S) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) for membrane fusion. In addition, these proteases cleave the viral receptor, the carboxypeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and it was proposed that ACE2 cleavage augments viral infectivity.\n\nA study demonstrated that COVID-19 reduces testosterone levels in men by altering the functioning of the gonads. So could the increased severity of the disease in men be due to lowered testosterone. But according to the principal investigator explanation COVID-19 reduces testosterone levels because there is a dramatic reductions in the cholesterol levels of patients infected with COVID 19, compared with healthy controls . Cholesterol levels decline quite rapidly during the early stages of infection and increase as the patient starts to recover.Therefore, indicating that cholesterol may have an important role to play in defending the body against such infections and depending on the principal investigator explanation, Testosterone is synthesized starting from cholesterol through a well-characterized steroid biosynthetic pathway involving the sequential action of multiple enzymes So, when cholesterol levels are decreased, this decrease will followed by decreasing in testosterone level and according to this explanation testosterone therapy in COVID 2019 is not recommended but temporary inhibitor of DHT is recommended such as Isotretinoin because this treatment by testosterone will inhibit cholesterol synthesis by feedback inhibition and decrease cholesterol uptake by Leydig cells in testis and this also will lead to over increase in DHT lvels and its derivatives in different tissues, which will induce TMPRSS2. because DHT is a potent activator of TMPRSS2 and this will be followed by processing and activation of COVID2019 spike protein to bined its ACE2 receptors in lung and kidney leading to their damage specifically in testis because it contains high levels of proteases and ACE2. Serine proteases are emerging as important contributors to the production, maturation, and functional competence of spermatozoa.\n\nDepending on this data and according to this protocol, The principal investigator expects and suggests that retinoic acid is specific modulator of androgens specifically DHT not testosterone and could reverse the androgenic induction and activation effect of (DHT) on TMPRSS2 expression and prevent cleaving and activating both the spike protein (S) of COVID 2019 and the viral receptor, the carboxypeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). (All ideas and michanisms specifically role of Androgen in TMPRSS2 activation in COVID-19: Serendipity or opportunity for intervention and the inhibition of ACE2 ,AT1 protein and Ang II-mediated intracellular calcium release pathway which is responsible for SARS-CoV-2 cell fusion and entry included in the research protocol were submitted to Academy of scientific research and technology - Egypt- on 4 April , 2020. in Call no. 2/2019/ASRT- Ideation Fund)\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nPromising features of COVID 2019 treatment according Principal Investigator Protocol:\n\nThis medication have the feature of Aerosolized Drug Delivery to increase its efficacy beside Oral administration, Which makes it distinct from other medication in which should dose be only given orally. A study demonstrated that treating with 13 cis retinoic acid aerosolized via inhalation rout did not cause any damage in lung cells. Repeated high doses of 13 cis retinoic by inhalation resulted in moderate loss of body weight, but microscopic investigation of ten tissues including lung and oesophagus did not detect any significant aerosol-induced damage. The results suggest that administration of isotretinoin via powder aerosol inhalation is probably superior to its application via the oral route in terms of achieving efficacious drug concentrations in the lung.\nInhaled isotretinoin might provide sufficient drug to the target cells for efficacy while avoiding systemic toxicity.\nA study demonstrated that 13 cis retinoic is used in treating Emphysema (emphysema is a lung condition that causes shortness of breath)\nATRA has been reported to induce formation of new alveoli and returns elastic recoil in the lung to approximately normal values in animal models of emphysema.\nStrong expectation of complete COVID 2019 blockade from cell entry and infection depending on strong ethics, researches and references.\nAvailability of our compounds.\nEase of application.\nExpectation of COVID 2019 treating of by more than one distinct mechanism.\nExpectation of High induction of anti- inflammatory T cells and significant inhibition of IL-6 at low concentrations.\nControlling Accompanying cytokine storm.\nNo interactions with Egyptian protocol drugs were found.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04353180","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

COVID-19, the disease caused by this virus, has a very polymorphous clinical presentation, which ranges from upper respiratory tract infections to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Research institutions are working restlessly to elucidate the physiopathology of COVID-19 to develop new and more efficacious strategies on diagnosis, treatment and prevention planning. However, many aspects of the disease process are still unknown. Despite the lack of complete understanding of COVID-19, recommandations from world health authorities to surgical societies have been published in order to prevent viral transmission within the hospital setting. Concerning prevention of viral transmission during laparoscopy on confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases, strict measures were taken to protect surgical and anesthesia staff. These recommandations are mainly based on avoiding leak of pneumoperitoneum during surgical exploration as it may represent a potential source of viral transmission, eventhough there is no scientific evidence on it. The lack of evidence of this mode of transmission makes difficult to develop more appropriate and efficacious recommandations. This study is designed to assess for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the peritoneal serosa during emergency laparoscopy on confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases.

Moreover, with increasing numbers of patients requiring intensive unit level care and mechanical ventilation, nations are already having to triage patients for ventilatory support due to limited resources and healthcare systems around the world being stretched to the point of collapse, highlighting the importance of identifying interventions that could prevent the development of respiratory failure for these patients.\n\nThe disease course of COVID-19 includes an incubation period, an acute viral phase that most commonly presents with flu-like symptoms that in some individuals progresses to a severe hyperinflammatory phase marked by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and hypoxemic respiratory failure.3,4 Though there is spectrum of clinical course, many progress to the hyperinflammatory phase around day seven of symptoms, often requiring intensive care unit (ICU) level care and mechanical ventilation.4 Accumulating evidence suggests that the pathophysiology underlying this profound decline is a severe inflammatory response as demonstrated by multi organ system dysfunction akin to cytokine release syndrome (CRS)/macrophage activation syndrome (MAS).3 CRS/MAS is a systemic hyperinflammatory syndrome on a spectrum with secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), typically characterized by multiorgan failure that is often triggered by viral infections in the setting of excessive immune activation, typically with marked hyperferritinemia.5 Postmortem assessment of patients with COVID-19 have demonstrated pathologic findings consistent with MAS such as mono/lymphocytic infiltrates within the lung parenchyma with associated edema and alveolar congestion, splenic necrosis with macrophage proliferation and hemophagocytosis, as well as a lymphocyte/histiocyte predominate infiltrate of portal vasculature accompanying liver necrosis and sinusoidal congestion.6 Cytokine profiling of patients with MAS/sHLH overlaps with that seen in patients with severe COVID-19 and includes elevated levels of IL-1, IL-2, IL-7, IL-6, G-CSF, MCP- 1, and TNF-α as well as elevated D-dimer, C-reactive protein, LDH and troponins.5,7,8 Moreover, preliminary data from a non-randomized series of COVID-19 patients with \"severe or critical COVID-19\" from China who were treated with tocilizumab (in addition to standard therapies) showed they had dramatic improvement in fever, arterial oxygen saturation and inflammatory markers within the first 24-hours following administration.9 Taken together, these data strongly suggest an immunologic link between COVID-19 and immune dysregulation resulting in MAS. Clinical trials are already underway studying the role of immunomodulatory therapy including modulation of IL-1 and IL-6 and downstream pathways in the setting of CAR-T induced MAS (NCT04150913, NCT04071366) and agents such anakinra and tocilizumab have been used in this context with promising results and good safety profiles. There is an urgent and dire need to study the therapeutic role for immunomodulatory therapy in COVID-19 disease to both halt disease progression in patients at an individual level and prevent the inevitable saturation of healthcare resources at a systems level, to which end there are numerous ongoing international trials to expand these efforts into the setting of COVID-19 infection (ChiCTR2000029765, NCT04324021, TOCOVID-19).

Efforts to save lives are essential as we will face increasing morbidity with rising demands on health care resources. Since pregnant women with COVID-19 have systematically been excluded from drug trials, potential treatment options for these high-risk individuals remain untested. The aim of our trial is to determine whether hydroxychloroquine given to COVID-19 positive pregnant women can reduce COVID-19-related hospital admissions, thereby allowing women to stay at home while limiting utilization of hospital resources and resulting exposure of health care providers.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nDue to physiologic and immune changes, pregnant women are at high risk of severe complications and mortality from COVID-19 infections. Despite this, epidemiologic data on SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy is currently limited to small case-series describing a clinical course ranging from mild to critical illness requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have demonstrated activity against SARS-coronaviruses in laboratory studies and are being tested in COVID-19 positive patients. HCQ appears more promising than chloroquine due to its greater effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and better safety profile. To date, pregnant women have been systematically excluded from trials conducted in the general outpatient population. Thus, we will carry out a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blinded trial of HCQ (considered safe in pregnancy in pregnant women with early COVID-19 infection across Canada to evaluate its effect in reducing COVID-19-related hospitalizations. This outpatient intervention is of paramount importance as its goal is to avoid overloading emergency rooms, obstetric triage, inpatient wards and critical care units. Upon completion of 6-month, our results can be directly applied to clinical care.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04354441","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

In a prospective, randomized, multicenter study, favipiravir (n = 120) was compared with Arbidol (n = 120) for the treatment of moderate and severe COVID-19 infections.

Official records indicate that, in Colombia, the first case was diagnosed on March 6, 2020, corresponding to a patient from Italy. However, in conversations with several infectologists and intensivists from Medellín, it was agreed that clinical cases similar to the clinical presentation that is now recognized as COVID-19 had arisen since the end of 2019 when it was still unknown to everyone. The previous suggests that the virus was already circulating in the country since before March 6, 2020. But at that moment, there were no tools to make a clinical identification, nor to diagnose it from the laboratory's point of view. This theory has been gathering momentum in other latitudes, demonstrating how the asymptomatic infected individuals are responsible for spreading the infection .\n\nConsidering as real the hypothesis that the infection has been circulating in the country since before the first official diagnosis, the question arises: Why does not the country still has the same healthcare and humanitarian chaos that countries such as Italy and Spain are suffering at this time? To answer this question, an extensive literature search of factors that differentiate Europeans from Latin Americans was carried out. Finding, in addition to genetic factors specific to race, differences in the number of ACEI receptors (binding site of the coronavirus to the alveolus), and differences in vaccination rates with BCG (Bacille Calmette-Guérin or tuberculosis vaccine), which is significantly higher in Latin America compared to those in Europe (3). This last finding could explain to some extent the situation in the country, since previous studies have shown the influence that this vaccine can have on the immune response against various other pathogens, including viruses (4,5).\n\nAmong the population at risk of infection, health-care workers due to their permanent contact with patients are the population group with the highest risk of contracting SARS-Cov-2 and developing COVID-19 in any of its clinical manifestations.\n\nCurrently, there are no vaccines or proven preventive interventions available to protect health-care workers. However, researchers from Germany, the Netherlands, Australia, and France are working on a clinical trial with an unorthodox approach to combat this new virus. This research study aims to demonstrate whether the centennial vaccine against tuberculosis (BCG), a bacterial disease, can activate the human immune system in a broad way, allowing it to better combat the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and, perhaps, prevents the complications that lead the patient to the intensive care unit and death. Initially, studies in these four countries will be carried out on doctors and nurses, since they are the ones with a higher risk of becoming infected compared to the general population.\n\nCurrently, the available evidence supports the hypothesis that BCG vaccination has beneficial heterologous effects against viral, bacterial, and fungal infections. The basis of these effects has been little explored in humans; however, this knowledge opens the door to future research to explore the effect of \"trained immunity\" associated with this vaccine, both for diseases in hosts with immunological disorders, and for autoinflammatory diseases, in which there is an inappropriate activation of inflammation (21). All of the findings described have considerable potential to aid in the design of new therapeutic strategies, such as the use of old and new vaccines that combine classical immune memory, and the activation of innate immunity by \"trained immunity,\" for prevention and treatment of infections, and modulation of exaggerated inflammation in autoinflammatory diseases.\n\nA multicenter, double-blind, randomized, phase III clinical trial will be carried out. 1000 healthy healthcare workers (doctors, nurses, and nursing assistants) with a negative test for COVID-19 and asymptomatic for the disease will be randomly assigned to receive one dose of BGC vaccine or placebo (saline solution). Volunteers will be followed for one year.\n\nHypothesis Healthcare workers who have negative SARS-Cov-2 serology and who receive the BCG vaccine, have a better clinical outcome if they become infected with COVID-19, in terms of not getting sick, requiring hospitalization or dying, than those who do not receive the vaccine.\n\nObjectives\n\nOverall Objective\n\nEvaluate the performance of BCG vaccination in reducing the severity of SARS-COV-2 infection compared to the placebo, in healthcare personnel from Medellín, Colombia.\n\n.

The spectrum of its clinical manifestations is strikingly broad and extends from mild disease (resembling an ordinary bout of flu or even asymptomatic) to pneumonia. The latter cases convey a high risk of evolution towards acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), eventually fatal when worsening with cytokine storm and multiple organ failure or with superinfection and sepsis. In the absence of overt variations of the virus itself, its interactions with the host immune system are likely crucial. Clinical features of patients with severe forms of COVID-19 were reported, but immunological description of biomarkers for exacerbation and mortality vs recovery remains superficial. Globally decreased white blood cells, notably T-cells, suggest that CoV-2 might trigger or exploit an immune defect. This could correspond to gaps in immune cell subpopulations, kinetics of activation or repertoires. Immune failure would then be responsible for exacerbations and a poor outcome in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Our objective is to characterize the kinetics of the immune response and of immune dysregulation in ARDS patients. In addition to studying severe ARDS patients, an inverse image of immune repertoires should appear in healed up patients, after they have reached an undetectable viral load and acquired protective antibodies (Abs). Humoral immunity mediated by specific anti-viral Abs was a key factor for recovery from SARS-CoV-1 infection, and this is also expected for CoV-2, making the Ig repertoire also of special interest for its inclusion of anti-viral neutralizing Abs (nAbs).\n\nAltogether, there is thus an urgent need for high-resolution characterization of the anti-CoV-2 immune response, correlating the dynamics of immune activation, cytokine production and immune repertoires with clinical evolution. In addition to providing biomarkers for prognosis evaluation and for monitoring innovative treatments, this will also participate to the urgent quest of as many possible monoclonal antibodies (mAb) candidates for immunotherapy","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04373200","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Pregnant women with COVID-19 are at high-risk of severe complications and mortality from COVID-19 infection, due to physiologic and immune changes occurring during pregnancy. These risks include development of maternal hypoxemic respiratory failure due to severe pneumonia, hospitalization in intensive care, death; but also, fetal morbidity-mortality with chronic and/or acute fetal distress, intrauterine growth retardation, intrauterine death and neonatal morbidity, mainly due to induced preterm birth and maternal-fetal transmission.

The apparently strong association between blood levels of inflammaory cytokines and SARS-CoV-2 disease severity has led clinicians to evaluate the administration of steroids or anti-IL-6 antagonists in severely ill patients. As of this day, biomarkers capable of predicting clinical disease progression in Covid-19 patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms have not yet been formally identified. Identifying such markers and evaluating their predictive value may be exploited to guide patient care management, and as such forms the core objective of this proposal.\n\nBecause of strong inter-individual variations in the ability of innate immune cells to produce cytokines, the hypothesis the investigators formulate and intend to test is that innate IL-6 responsiveness varies between recently infected Covid-19 patients and could predict disease outcome.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, the investigators propose to follow recently infected chronic haemodialysis patients with moderate Covid-19 symptoms. These patients stand a higher risk to progress to severe disease. The investigators plan to collect a blood sample in these patients using a system whereby ex vivo cytokine production is initiated in the very same blood collection tube without prior separation and centrifugation, thus reducing labour and operator bias. After incubation with or without known innate immune stimuli, the cell-free phase from each collection-culture tube will be assayed for IL-6 content. Associations between IL-6 content and disease outcome (encephalopathy, transfer to acute care or death) will be determined in 115 Covid-19 chronic haemodialysis patients with moderate symptoms followed in 9 centers.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04371510","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

A general principle of passive antibody therapy is that it is more effective when used for prophylaxis than for treatment of disease. When used for therapy, antibody is most effective when administered shortly after the onset of symptoms. The reason for temporal variation in efficacy is not well understood but could reflect that passive antibody works by neutralizing the initial inoculums, which is likely to be much smaller than that of established disease. As an example, passive antibody therapy for pneumococcal pneumonia was most effective when administered shortly after the onset of symptoms, and there was no benefit if antibody administration was delayed past the third day of disease.\n\nThe therapeutic benefits of convalescent plasma were formally studied in animal models in early 20th century. It efficacy was first determined in 1916, when 26 poliomyelitis patients were treated with convalescent plasma from polio survivors. Subsequently, therapeutic and prophylactic significance was explored in influenza and measles. Transfusion of immune plasma is a standard treatment modality for various viral hemorrhagic fevers. Its efficacy in treating Ebola Virus Disease is also well established. Studies have reported reduction viral load in patients with H1N1 influenza. Of special attention is the meta-analysis, carried out by Mair-Jenkinset al, concluding effectiveness of passive immunization as a treatment option for severe viral acute respiratory infections caused by SARS corona virus, influenza A (H1N1), avian influenza A (H5N1) and Spanish influenza A. Efficacy of convalescent plasma has been anecdotally reported in SARS-CoV-2 infections.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04352751","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

It is caused by a novel coronavirus with no current specific prevention nor treatment therapies. Treatments have been administered to patients with COVID-19 in order to control viral infection, among them: Chloroquine (CQ) and Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), Lopinavir/Ritonavir (Lop/r), Remdesivir, Favipavir, acting over bacterial co-infection Azithromycin (Azithro), or modifying the inflammatory response of the host (Tocilizumab). Clinical trials offer conflicting evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of therapies The real effectiveness and safety profile of the treatments for COVID-19 remains unknown.\n\nObjective: Evaluate the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological therapies used to treat adult patients with COVID-19.\n\nMethods: Pragmatic randomized controlled trial. Study population: Adults aged 18 years or over with a positive real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV-2 (SARS CoV-2) and diagnosis of mild, severe or critical pneumonia, requiring hospital management at six hospitals in Colombia. Exclusion criteria: Pregnancy, known allergy to treatment, cirrhosis or hepatic abnormality (transaminases greater than 5 reference values), prolonged QT interval, glomerular filtration rate lesser than 30 ml/min/1.73m^2, history of lung fibrosis, advanced or metastatic cancer. Sample size: 1,600 participants. The study will be carried out in two phases. The first phase will be conducted with 480 participants and aims to identify treatments with higher or minimum potential, discontinue treatments with higher toxicity and have opportunity of introducing new treatments with potential efficacy. The second phase will be conducted with 1,120 participants to evaluate the effectiveness of the selected treatments. Four interventions have been defined: I1 HCQ, I2 HCQ plus Lop/r, I3 HCQ plus Azithro and I4 standard treatment. Within each institution, participants will be randomly assigned to one of the treatment arms assigned to that institution. Concealment will be kept through a central telephone. Treatment administration will be open. Variables: Sociodemographic and clinical at recruitment; (comorbidities, need for therapeutic support , grade of invasion at admission). Primary outcomes. Effectiveness: Mortality. Safety: Serious adverse events (AE) assessed by the NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Guidance for Collection of Adverse Events Related to COVID-19 Infection. Secondary outcomes: Intensive care unit (ICU) admission, requirement of respiratory support, time to death, number of participants cured, any adverse event related to treatment. Analysis: Descriptive for the presentation of summary measures of the basal conditions by type of variable. Bivariate.

Description of crude effectiveness and safety by means of the difference of accumulated incidences, each one with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) Intention to treat analyisis will be done. Adjusted analysis: The ratio and difference of cumulative incidences of mortality at 7 and 28 days and severe adverse events between treatments will be estimated, adjusting for confounding variables using logistic regression models with mixed effects considering each institution as a level or from equations. generalized estimation (GEE).\n\nEthical considerations: The study has a risk beyond minimum according to the Resolution 8430/1993 of the Colombian Ministry of Health. Informed consent will be explained and signed if the patient is in condition to do so. This protocol will undergo evaluation by the ethics committee at each of the participating institutions and at the National University of Colombia. The protocol follows the Helsinki Declaration and institutional protocols for clinical investigation.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nInterim analysis and sample size\n\nThe study will be carried out in two stages, given the great uncertainty surrounding the safety and effectiveness of the treatments, as well as taking into account the speed in which evidence is appearing locally and globally. The first stage of the study will be carried out with a sample of 480 participants, with the aim of identifying the treatments with the greatest potential, as well as discarding early those treatments with the highest toxicity or lowest effectiveness, in order to introduce a new drug. In the second stage, with a sample of 1,120 participants, the effectiveness of the four treatments selected at the beginning of the second stage will be evaluated, which may be the same contained in the 3 active treatment arms and the standard management group or one or more new drugs arms. The total sample size of the study will be 1,600 participants.\n\nStage 1. Evaluation of the safety and minimum effectiveness of the selected treatments:\n\nFor this stage, a sample size of 480 participants collected from the 6 institutions was calculated, obtaining, for the six possible comparisons of the four interventions, 120 participants for each intervention. Assuming a loss percentage of 10.\n\nSafety evaluation: If a treatment presents in the first 30 participants 3 severe adverse events or if during the execution of this stage it reaches a percentage of severe adverse events greater than or equal to 10 percent, the drug will be withdrawn.\n\nEvaluation of the minimum effectiveness: A first interim analysis will be carried out with 66 percent of the sample at this stage, which allows testing whether there is an expected significant difference of 20 percent in hospital mortality with a power of 94 percent. If a significant difference is found, the treatment with less effectiveness (highest mortality) will be replaced.\n\nWhen completing the sample size of this stage (480 participants), a second interim analysis will be carried out that allows testing whether there is an expected difference of 15 percent (25 percent - 10 percent), with a power of 84 percent. As in the previous analysis, if significant differences are found, the treatment with less effectiveness (highest mortality) is replaced. At this point, a futility analysis will also be performed where the conditional probability of finding a significant difference at the end of the study will be calculated given the information collected so far. For this analysis, an expected difference of 10 percent will be assumed at the end of the study (difference assumed at the beginning of the study) and the treatment will be replaced if the calculated conditional probability is less than 0.2. For all the tests carried out at this stage, the correction of the type I error will be made using the O'Brien-Fleming method.\n\nIt is important to clarify that the randomization of participants should be stopped once completing the number of randomized participants per treatment, until the intermediate outcome (in-hospital mortality) is obtained and the results of the interim analysis are produced.\n\nStage 2. Estimation of effectiveness:\n\nWith a sample size of 1,120 participants collected from 6 institutions, for the six possible comparisons of the four interventions, 280 participants were obtained for each intervention, allowing the evaluation of an expected difference of 10 (25 percent - 15 percent) with a power of 81 percent and a significance level of 0.05. A loss percentage of 10 will be considered.\n\nRules for selecting a drug to be included in the RCT in stage 2\n\nCriteria for inclusion of a new drug, in its order:\n\nEvidence that the drug is safe in humans\nThe drug must have a record from the National Institute for Food and Drug Surveillance (Invima)\nDrug's availability in the country\nThe drug must show at least 15 percent superiority to standard management in other randomized clinical trials that have been conducted in patients with SARS CoV-2 / COVID-19\nBiological plausibility and studies that support the choice: in vitro case series studies, use in similar situations\nOngoing studies that are evaluating the drug's effectiveness and safety\nThe drug must meet the objective of the study","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04359095","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

An initial cluster of infections was linked to Huanan seafood market, potentially due to animal contact. Subsequently, human-to-human transmission occurred and the disease, now termed coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) rapidly spread within China and all over the world. A novel coronavirus, SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is closely related to SARS-CoV, was detected in patients and is believed to be the etiologic agent of the new lung disease. The causative agent of the current COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2, is a single stranded positive sense RNA virus that is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nSelected Drugs\n\nIvermectin has anti-parasitic effect along with anti-viral activity against a broad range of viruses in vitro. Ivermectin was identified as an inhibitor of interaction between the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) integrase protein (IN) and the importin (IMP) α/β1 heterodimer responsible for IN nuclear import. Ivermectin has since been confirmed to inhibit HIV-1 replication. Importantly, Ivermectin has been demonstrated to limit infection by RNA viruses such as West Nile Virus and influenza. This broad-spectrum activity is believed to be due to the reliance by many different RNA viruses on IMPα/β1 during infection. Ivermectin has similarly been shown to be effective against the DNA virus pseudorabies virus (PRV) both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, Ivermectin was the focus of a phase III clinical trial in Thailand against DENV infection, in which a single daily oral dose was observed to be safe and resulted in a significant reduction in serum levels of viral NS1 protein, but no change in viremia or clinical benefit was observed.\n\nThe causative agent of the current COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2, is a single stranded positive sense RNA virus that is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Studies on SARS-CoV proteins have revealed a potential role for IMPα/β1 during infection in signal-dependent nucleocytoplasmic shutting of the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein that may impact host cell division. In addition, the SARS-CoV accessory protein ORF6 has been shown to antagonize the antiviral activity of the STAT1 transcription factor by sequestering IMPα/β1 on the rough ER/Golgi membrane.\n\nTaken together, these reports suggested that Ivermectin's nuclear transport inhibitory activity may be effective against SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, it has been postulated that the FDA-approved drug Ivermectin inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro whereas a single treatment was able to provoke approximately 5000-fold reduction in viral load within 48h. Ivermectin has an established safety profile for human use. Recent reviews and meta-analysis indicate that high dose Ivermectin has comparable safety as the standard low-dose treatment, although there is not enough evidence to make conclusion about the safety profile in pregnancy. In clinical setting, Ivermectin was the focus of a phase III clinical trial on patients with dengue viral infection in Thailand, in which a single daily dose (200 - 400 µg/kg once daily for 2 days in one arm and 200-400 µg/kg once daily for 3 days in the other arm) was found to be safe but did not produce any clinical benefit. In previous clinical study, one dose of Ivermectin 200 μg/kg or four doses of Ivermectin 200 μg/kg (given on days 1, 2, 15, and 16) for the treatment of non-disseminated strongyloidiasis were implicated. The author proposed that, multiple doses of Ivermectin did not show higher efficacy and was tolerated less than a single dose. A single dose should, therefore, be preferred for the treatment of non-disseminated strongyloidiasis.\n\nNitazoxanide is originally developed as an antiprotozoal agent and has a broad-spectrum antiviral activity undergoing development for the treatment of influenza and other viral respiratory infections. In addition to its antiviral activity, Nitazoxanide inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Nitazoxanide could improve outcomes in patients infected with MERS-CoV by suppressing overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6. Nitazoxanide has been tested in clinical setting for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza, where the subjects received either 600 or 300 mg of Nitazoxanide or placebo orally twice daily for five days and were followed for 28 days. Subjects who received Nitazoxanide 600 mg twice daily experienced shorter times to alleviation of symptoms compared with subjects who received 300 mg Nitazoxanide twice daily, which in turn, was shorter than placebo.\n\nAccording to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, there is lack of effective antiviral therapy against COVID-19. Nearly all patients who suffered from COVID-19-associated pneumonia accepted oxygen therapy and WHO recommended extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to patients with refractory hypoxemia. Rescue treatment with convalescent plasma and immunoglobulin G are delivered to some critical cases according to their condition.\n\nThe rationale of the use of Ivermectin and Nitazoxanide combination for treatment of COVID-19 infected patients is based on the antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity of the selected drugs. Since the two drugs exhibit different modes of action, it would be of value in containing the viral infection through targeting different sites in the pathophysiology of the disease.\n\nDiagnostic criteria\n\nThe viral research institution in China has conducted preliminary identification of the SARS-CoV-2 through the classical Koch's postulates and observing its morphology through electron microscopy. So far, the golden clinical diagnosis method of COVID-19 is nucleic acid detection in the nasal and throat swab sampling or other respiratory tract samplings by real-time PCR and further confirmation by next-generation sequencing.\n\nCommon Side Effects of Ivermectin\n\nItching and rash\nSwelling\nHeadache\nJoint pain\nPink eye, inflammation of the eyes or discomfort\nDizziness and drop in blood pressure upon standing\nRacing heart beat\nChanges in liver function tests\nSerious Side Effects of Ivermectin (Generally with Ivermectin tablets)\nSevere skin reactions\nSeizures\nAsthma flare-up\nChanges in vision\nSudden drop in blood pressure\nDizziness upon standing\nLiver dysfunction\nBleeding\n\nDrug interactions of Ivermectin\n\nWarfarin and Coumarin Ivermectin may decrease the anticoagulant activities of warfarin and 4-hydroxycoumarin\nAlbendazole The metabolism of Albendazole can be increased when combined with Ivermectin\nDoxycyline\n\nAdditive pharmacodynamic effect\n\nContraindication of Ivermectin\nAbnormal liver function tests\nAllergies towards Ivermectin\nSide effects of Nitazoxanide\nThe most common adverse effects are GIT as nausea and occasional stomach cramps with mild diarrhea, reduced appetite and vomiting. Nervous system side effects as headache, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, tremor, and hypesthesia have been reported in less than 1% of the patients.\n\nContraindications of Nitazoxanide\n\nThere are no data on the excretion of Nitazoxanide into human milk. The manufacturer recommends that caution should be used when administering Nitazoxanide to nursing women.\n\nInteractions of Nitazoxanide\n\nTizoxanide (the active metabolite of Nitazoxanide) is highly bound to plasma protein (> 99.9%). Therefore, it is necessary to monitor for adverse reactions when administering Nitazoxanide concurrently with other highly plasma protein-bound drugs with narrow therapeutic indices, as competition for binding sites may occur (e.g., warfarin).\n\nWarning\n\nNitazoxanide should be used with caution in patients with significant renal and hepatic impairment.\n\nResearch Objectives\n\nThe pandemic disease COVID-19 is particularly of major importance in Egypt where a heavy population lives. There is an acute need for comprehensive, continuous, and cost-effective health care delivery for infected people. Early detection and strategies for prevention of progression of COVID-19 would make a major difference for these patients and would also be economically beneficial for a resource-constrained country.\n\nThis research proposal was employed as a practical strategy for providing a suitable drug combination for possible treatment of COVID-19 infected patients. This drug combination may help to prevent the progression of respiratory complications. This can be achieved through different goals as follows:\n\nScreening of different drugs related to different pharmacological classes depending on its possible activity against COVID-19 virus.\nProviding cost-effective and easy-to-implement treatment strategy for infected patients and/or patients with high risk of developing respiratory failure.\nFinally, this clinical strategy remains an important goal in improving Egyptian health state which can save people life and save a lot of money.\n\nScope of Work\n\nThe scope of work will be conducted through\n\nUse of new drug combination of Ivermectin and Nitazoxanide for treatment of COVID-19 infected people. Since the two drugs exhibit different modes of action, it would be of value in containing the viral infection through targeting different sites in the pathophysiology of the disease.\nEvaluation of the effect of new drug combination on the symptomatic treatment of COVID-19 patients according to WHO (Clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) when COVID-19 disease is suspected) interim guidance published at 13 March 2020.\nInvestigating the impact of new drug combination on the prevention of severe compilations such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04360356","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Low doses of Naltrexone, a drug approved for treating alcoholism and opiate addiction, as well as Ketamine, a drug approved as an anesthetic, may be able to interrupt the inflammation that causes the worst COVID-19 symptoms and prove an effective new treatment. This study will investigate their effectiveness in a randomized, blinded trial versus standard treatment plus placebo.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nThere is an urgent need to develop new treatments for Novel Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) infection using easily available and affordable medications. We need to develop a treatment protocol which prevents progression of the disease and a treatment protocol to rescue those with advanced disease. In addition to anti-viral therapeutics currently under investigation in other trials, the addition of immunomodulators to the treatment regimen appears have to potential to act as agents which can reduce the pathogenicity of this disease by reducing the dysregulation of autoimmunity which is destructive of normal tissue and when unchecked rapidly leads to mortality.\n\nCOVID-19 infection has three stages and 80% of infected people stay in stage 1 or stage 2A (viral response and early pulmonary effects), however 20% of patients progress to stage 2B (late pulmonary effects), and of those about 20% progress to stage 3 (hyper-inflammation). An ideal treatment for COVID-19 would have a two-pronged strategy: a treatment that would slow or interrupt the progression of the disease from mild/moderate (stage 1-2A) to severe (stage 2B-3), and a treatment to rescue patients who have become severe. Promising data using tocilizumab, an monoclonal antibody targeting the cytokine Interleukin-6 (IL-6), suggests that interrupting IL-6 is one of the potential pathways to accomplish this.\n\nLow-dose naltrexone has been used off-label for treatment of pain and inflammation in multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, fibromyalgia and other pain conditions. Lower than standard doses of naltrexone inhibit cellular proliferation of T- and B- cells and block Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), providing pain relief and anti-inflammatory benefit. Naltrexone at doses below the normal therapeutic dose appears to reduce production of multiple cytokines including IL-6 in a steady pace and is available as an oral preparation. As such it is ideal to use to attempt to modify progression to stage 2B as it can easily be given to both hospitalized patients and patients in the community.\n\nKetamine at low doses, below the normal anesthetic dose, appears to rapidly reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), for hours after an event which would induce the inflammatory response. This drug is given intravenously (IV), either by drip or push, and is easily given in a hospital environment. This could not easily be used in the community but could act as a rescue drug with lower cost and easier availability than tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting IL-6. Ketamine has been extensively studied in a variety of settings and indications with a well-established side-effect and dosing profile. Ketamine is generally well tolerated and remains inexpensive and widely available on the U.S. market and available for immediate use.\n\nThe trial will measure the ability of low dose naltrexone to reduce the progression of participants with COVID-19. In this study, naltrexone or placebo will be given to participants in early stages of COVID-19 infection in a randomized, double blinded manner, whereas the use of ketamine will be unblinded and given as a rescue agent should a participant progress. Additionally, should a participant be ineligible for the randomized portion of the study due to already being in a more advanced stage of the disease, they will be given the opportunity to enter the trial to receive ketamine without being randomized to naltrexone vs placebo.\n\nParticipants will continue to receive any standard of care COVID-19 treatment during their participation in this study. Laboratory blood tests such as IL-6 concentration, blood counts, liver and renal function panels as well as close physician supervision will be used to monitor participant condition during hospitalization. Participants will be contacted 1 month post discharge to evaluate outcomes and potential side effects.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04365985","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

A total of 29 eligible subjects will be enrolled to receive anti-SARS-CoV-2 plasma.Outcomes will be compared to hospitalized controls with confirmed COVID-19 disease through retrospective chart review.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nThere are no proven treatments for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and associated pneumonia caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Recent experience in China suggests that convalescent immune plasma(CIP)may be an effective treatment for COVID-19. In the pandemic situation where there are no vaccines for COVID-19, specific antibodies in convalescent plasma induced by infection may provide passive protective immunity. Passive antibody therapy was the first immunotherapy dating back to the 1890's for the treatment of infectious diseases before the development of antibiotics 1940's. Experience from prior outbreaks with other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-1 shows that such convalescent plasma contains neutralizing antibodies to the relevant virus. In SARS-CoV-2, passive antibody therapy from CIP probably provided protection by viral neutralization. CIP was also used in the 2013 Ebola epidemic. A small non-randomized study in Sierra Leone revealed a significant increase in survival for who received CIP4. CIP administration is the only approach that provides immediate immunity to patients who have been exposed or who have active disease.\n\nThis approach is immediately available from individuals who have recovered, are viral free,and can donate immune plasma (IP) containing high titer neutralizing antibodies. Passive antibody therapy can be given to a patient recently exposed or a patient who is developing an infection with COVID-19 by obtaining plasma units from immune individuals by standard plasmapheresis using FDA-approved blood banking procedures, cross matching the unit(s) to the recipients and infusing the unit(s) using standard transfusion procedures for blood products. Based on the safety and long-term experience with plasma infusions, plasma exchanges, and other procedures involving plasma or plasma product, this protocol was designed as a phase II single arm trial that involves the administration of antibodies to a given agent to a susceptible individual for the purpose of preventing or treating an infectious disease due to that agent.\n\nThe only antibody formulation that is available for emergent use is that found in convalescent plasma. As more individuals contract COVID-19 and recover, the number of potential donors will increase.\n\nThe principle of passive antibody therapy is that it is more effective when used for prophylaxis than for treatment of disease. When used for therapy, antibody is most effective when administered shortly after the onset of symptoms. The reason for temporal variation in efficacy is not well understood but could reflect that passive antibody works by neutralizing the initial inoculum, which is likely to be much smaller than that of established disease. Alternatively, antibodies may dampen the early inflammatory response leaving the infected individual asymptomatic. For example, antibody therapy for pneumococcal pneumonia was most effective when given shortly after the onset of symptoms and was of no benefit if antibody therapy was delayed beyond the third day of disease. For passive antibody therapy to be effective, a sufficient amount of antibody must be infused. The antibody will circulate in the blood, reach tissues,and provide protection against infection. Depending on the type of antibody, amount, and composition, the half-life can vary from weeks to months. It is under these circumstances, the investigators plan to treat patients who are sick enough to be hospitalized before the onset of overwhelming disease involving a systemic inflammatory response, sepsis, and/or ARDS.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04374565","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Although considerable overlap of these populations has been observed (elevated hsTPN and requirement for mechanical ventilation) there is not 100% redundancy and it is hopeful that COVID19 CP may provide benefit to these critically ill patients.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nCoronavirus's are responsible for 15-30% of \"common colds\" and approximately 2% of the population may be healthy carriers of these viruses. The ongoing SARS CoV-2 pandemic originated in Wuhan, Hubei, China and has spread worldwide. The disease caused by SARS CoV-2 (COVID19) is manifest by fever, fatigue, dry cough, pharyngitis and headache. Although the majority (~80%) COVID19 cases are mild in severity, patients may present with moderate symptoms of dyspnea, tachypnea (~15%) or more severe symptoms (~5-10%) of pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypotension, arrythmias and shock(6-9). In addition to the common clinical presentation of respiratory distress, an increasing frequency of cardiovascular manifestations have become evident. These manifestations may be linked to the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor, a membrane-bound aminopeptidase that has been identified as the functional receptor for SARS CoV-2, which is expressed predominantly in the heart, intestine, kidney and pulmonary alveolar (type 2) cells. Recent data suggest that ~20% of infected subjects may require hospitalization and among patients hospitalized for COVID19, 12-28% will have evidence of myocardial injury (elevated high-sensitivity Troponin: hsTPN) often in association with electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities, arrythmias and/or evidence for impaired Left Ventricular contractile function on non-invasive imaging. Indeed, a syndrome of \"pseudo-infarction\" manifest as ST-segment elevation in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease has been described. The etiology(s) of myocardial injury may be multifactorial and includes demand ischemia due to critical illness, cytokine storm with atherosclerotic plaque disruption due to overwhelming systemic inflammation and more likely, myocarditis. Indeed, SARS CoV viral RNA along with macrophage infiltration and myocardial cell injury has been detected in autopsied heart samples from patients who succumbed to the SARS outbreak in Toronto. Further, myocardial injury has been directly correlated with both the degree of systemic inflammation (Level of hsCRP) and cardiac dysfunction (level of NT-proBNP). Importantly, myocardial injury was identified to be one of the two most significant, independent predictors (by multi-variable analysis) of hospital death (in addition to ARDS) and provides increased prognostic information above and beyond that provided by pre-existing co-morbidities including age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Indeed, the incremental risk for death incurred by evidence of myocardial injury appears to be ~5-10x and is amplified by pre-existing cardiovascular disease.\n\nThus, evidence of myocardial injury has evolved to be a significant (if not the most significant) predictor of mortality among patients admitted to hospital for care of COVID19 disease. It is important to recognize that this elevated morality risk has been identified despite modern and aggressive intensive care therapies including mechanical ventilation, pressor/inotrope therapies and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).\n\nIn this context, the investigators propose to evaluate intravenous administration of convalescent plasma (CP) obtained from COVID19 survivors in patients requiring hospitalization for symptomatic \"high risk\" COVID19 disease as reflected by the presence of elevated hsTPN. Supportive data exist for use of convalescent plasma in the treatment of COVID19 and other overwhelming viral illness.

The mortality rate is approximately 5% of reported cases and over half of patients that require mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure. As the disease continues to spread, strategies for reducing duration of ventilator support in patients with COVID-19 could significantly reduce morbidity and mortality of these individuals and future patients requiring this severely limited life-saving resource. Methods to improve gas exchange and to reduce the inflammatory response in COVID-19 are desperately needed to save lives.\n\nThe ketogenic diet is a high fat, low carbohydrate, adequate-protein diet that promotes metabolic ketosis (ketone body production) through hepatic metabolism of fatty acids. High fat, low carbohydrate diets have been shown to reduce duration of ventilator support and partial pressure carbon dioxide in patients with acute respiratory failure. In addition, metabolic ketosis reduces systemic inflammation. This mechanism could be leveraged to halt the cytokine storm characteristic of COVID-19 infection.\n\nThe hypothesis of this study is that the administration of a ketogenic diet will improve gas exchange, reduce inflammation, and duration of mechanical ventilation. The plan is to enroll 15 intubated patients with COVID 19 infection and administer a 4:1 ketogenic formula during their intubation.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-2019) is a devastating viral illness that originated in Wuhan China in late 2019. The number of confirmed cases worldwide has nearly reached 2 million and more than 125,000 people have died. Early studies from Wuhan reported a mortality rate of 2-3% with lower rates in surrounding provinces as the disease spread (closer to 0.7% of confirmed cases). One hypothesized cause for the higher mortality rate in Wuhan compared to surrounding regions was the rapid \"surge\" of COVID-19 infections before the disease was identified and social distancing implemented. Critically ill patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome with inflammatory pulmonary edema and life-threatening hypoxemia requiring mechanical ventilation. This resulted in a significant strain on health-care resources such as availability of mechanical ventilators to treat patients with acute respiratory failure. As the disease spreads worldwide, strategies for reducing duration of ventilator support in patients with COVID-19 could significantly reduce morbidity and mortality of these individuals and future patients requiring this severely limited life-saving resource.\n\nAlterations in macronutrient composition may be leveraged to improve ventilation and inflammation in COVID-19 patients. The ketogenic diet is a high fat, low carbohydrate, adequate protein diet that promotes ketone body production through hepatic metabolism of fatty acids. High fat, low carbohydrate diets have been shown to reduce duration of ventilator support and partial pressure carbon dioxide in patients with acute respiratory failure. Switching from glucose to fat oxidation lowers the respiratory quotient, thereby reducing the amount of carbon dioxide produced. This reduces ventilator demands and may improve oxygenation by lowering alveolar carbon dioxide levels, ultimately reducing time on mechanical ventilation. A study published in 1989 compared 10 participants intubated for acute respiratory failure and randomized to a high-fat, low carbohydrate diet and 10 participants receiving a standard isocaloric, isonitrogenous diet and showed a decrease in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 16% in the ketogenic diet group compared to a 4% increase in the standard diet group (p=0.003). The patients in the high-fat diet group had a mean of 62 fewer hours on a ventilator (p = 0.006) compared to the control group.\n\nThe high-fat diet used in the study had a ratio of 1.2:1 fat to protein and carbohydrate combined in grams. The ketogenic diet, which has been used safely and effectively in patients with chronic epilepsy for nearly one century and more recently in critically ill, intubated patients for the management of refractory and super-refractory status epilepticus has a 4:1 ratio (90% fat kilocalories). While a 1:1 ratio diet can produce a state of mild metabolic ketosis (typically ~ 1 mmol/L of the ketone body betahydroxybutyrate, measured in serum), a higher 4:1 ratio ketogenic diet can produce higher ketone body betahydroxybutyrate levels and more rapidly (up to 2 mmol/L within 24 hours of initiation). One study of obese patients treated with ketogenic diet reported that increases in ketone body production correlated with a lower partial pressure of carbon dioxide levels. A more recent study showed that patients with refractory epilepsy had a reduction in the respiratory quotient and increased fatty acid oxidation without a change in the respiratory energy expenditure with chronic use of the ketogenic diet. These findings were replicated in healthy subjects on ketogenic diet compared to a control group and patients on a ketogenic diet also had a significant reduction in carbon dioxide output and partial pressure of carbon dioxide. The authors concluded that a ketogenic diet may decrease carbon dioxide body stores and that use of a ketogenic diet may be beneficial for patients with respiratory failure. Even in patients without hypercapnia (primarily hypoxic respiratory failure), lowering carbon dioxide production permits lowering tidal volumes - a cornerstone of acute respiratory distress syndrome management.\n\nIn addition to reducing the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, metabolic ketosis reduces systemic inflammation. This mechanism could be leveraged to halt the cytokine storm characteristic of COVID-19 infection. Several studies provide evidence that pro-inflammatory cytokine production is significantly reduced in animals fed a ketogenic diet in a variety of disease models. In a rodent model of Parkinson's disease, mice were found to have significantly decreased levels of pro-inflammatory, macrophage secreted cytokines interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and Tumor necrosis factor-alpha after 1 week of treatment with a ketogenic diet. Likewise, rats pretreated with a ketogenic diet prior to injection with lipopolysaccharide to induce fever did not experience an increase in body temperature or interleukin-1β, while significant increases were seen in control animals not pretreated with a ketogenic diet. In a mouse model of NLRP3-mediated diseases as well as human monocytes, the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate inhibited the NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated production of interleukin-1β and interleukin-18. These findings have been replicated in several recent animal studies and preliminary studies in humans. The hypothesis of this study is that through induction of metabolic ketosis combined with carbohydrate restriction, a ketogenic diet is protective against the cytokine storm in COVID-19. With its carbon dioxide-lowering and anti-inflammatory properties, a ketogenic diet may become an important component of the acute respiratory distress syndrome arsenal with immediate relevance to the current COVID-19 pandemic.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04358835","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

An initial cluster of infections was linked to Huanan seafood market, potentially due to animal contact. Subsequently, human-to-human transmission occurred and the disease, now termed coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) rapidly spread within China and all over the world. A novel coronavirus, SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is closely related to SARS-CoV, was detected in patients and is believed to be the etiologic agent of the new lung disease. The causative agent of the current COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2, is a single stranded positive sense RNA virus that is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nSelected Drugs\n\nHydroxychloroquine (an analog of chloroquine) has been demonstrated to have an anti-SARS-CoV activity in vitro. Hydroxychloroquine clinical safety profile is better than that of chloroquine (during long-term use) and allows higher daily dose and has fewer concerns about drug-drug interactions. Hydroxychloroquine has long-term safety (600 mg/day for 12 to 18 months was safe). Hydroxychloroquine effectively inhibited both the entry, transport and the post-entry stages of SARS-CoV-2, similar to the chloroquine, and one study found Hydroxychloroquine to be a more potent agent than chloroquine in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Hydroxychloroquine acts as a weak base that can change the pH of acidic intracellular organelles including endosomes/lysosomes, essential for the membrane fusion. Besides, the significant decrease in the production of pro-inflammatory markers and cytokines with Hydroxychloroquine has made this agent a successful disease modifying anti-inflammatory agent in the treatment of various autoimmune diseases. An additional issue to be considered in severely sick patients is cytokine storm associated with disease severity of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThere are no currently available data from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to inform clinical guidance on the use, dosing, or duration of Hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although optimal dosing and duration of Hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 are unknown, some U.S. clinicians have reported anecdotally different Hydroxychloroquine dosing such as 400 mg twice daily on day one, then daily for 5 days; 400 mg twice daily on day one, then 200 mg twice daily for 4 days; 600 mg twice daily on day one, then 400 mg daily on days 2-5. In a recent clinical trial, Hydroxychloroquine sulfate 200 mg, three times per day during ten days was used in patients with COVID-19.\n\nNitazoxanide is originally developed as an antiprotozoal agent and has a broad-spectrum antiviral activity undergoing development for the treatment of influenza and other viral respiratory infections. In addition to its antiviral activity, Nitazoxanide inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Nitazoxanide could improve outcomes in patients infected with MERS-CoV by suppressing overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6. Nitazoxanide has been tested in clinical setting for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza, where the subjects received either 600 or 300 mg of Nitazoxanide or placebo orally twice daily for five days and were followed for 28 days. Subjects who received Nitazoxanide 600 mg twice daily experienced shorter times to alleviation of symptoms compared with subjects who received 300 mg Nitazoxanide twice daily, which in turn, was shorter than placebo.\n\nAccording to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, there is lack of effective antiviral therapy against COVID-19. Nearly all patients who suffered from COVID-19-associated pneumonia accepted oxygen therapy and WHO recommended extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to patients with refractory hypoxemia. Rescue treatment with convalescent plasma and immunoglobulin G are delivered to some critical cases according to their condition.\n\nThe rationale of the use of Hydoxychloroquine and Nitazoxanide combination for treatment of COVID-19 infected patients is based on the antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity of the selected drugs. Since the two drugs exhibit different modes of action, it would be of value in containing the viral infection through targeting different sites in the pathophysiology of the disease.\n\nDiagnostic criteria\n\nThe viral research institution in China has conducted preliminary identification of the SARS-CoV-2 through the classical Koch's postulates and observing its morphology through electron microscopy. So far, the golden clinical diagnosis method of COVID-19 is nucleic acid detection in the nasal and throat swab sampling or other respiratory tract samplings by real-time PCR and further confirmation by next-generation sequencing.\n\nSide effects of Hydroxychloroquine\n\nThe most common adverse effects are mild nausea and occasional stomach cramps with mild diarrhea, reduced appetite and vomiting\nThe most serious adverse effects are retinopathy and heart problems\nLong term use may cause liver toxicity Contraindications of Hydroxychloroquine\nHeart conditions, diabetes or psoriasis.\nThe drug transfers into breast milk so should be used with care by pregnant or nursing women\n\nInteractions of Hydroxychloroquine\n\nAntacids may decrease the absorption of Hydroxychloroquine.\nBoth neostigmine and pyridostigmine antagonize the action of Hydroxychloroquine.\nThere may be a link between Hydroxychloroquine and hemolytic anemia in those with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.\nDigoxin; concomitant administration with Hydroxychloroquine may result in increased serum digoxin levels.\nInsulin or antidiabetic drugs; concomitant administration with Hydroxychloroquine may enhance the effects of the hypoglycemic treatment.\nHydroxychloroquine prolongs the QT interval and may increase the risk of inducing ventricular arrhythmias if used concurrently with other arrhythmogenic drugs.\nMefloquine and other drugs that lower the convulsive threshold, when co-administered with Hydroxychloroquine, there may be an increased risk of convulsions.\nConcurrent use of Hydroxychloroquine with antiepileptics may impair the antiepileptic activity.\nCyclosporin when used concomitantly with Hydroxychloroquine, an increased plasma cyclosporin level was reported.\n\nSide effects of Nitazoxanide\n\nThe most common adverse effects are GIT as nausea and occasional stomach cramps with mild diarrhea, reduced appetite and vomiting. Nervous system side effects as headache, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, tremor, and hypesthesia have been reported in less than 1% of the patients.\n\nContraindications of Nitazoxanide\n\nThere are no data on the excretion of Nitazoxanide into human milk. The manufacturer recommends that caution be used when administering Nitazoxanide to nursing women.\n\nTizoxanide (the active metabolite of Nitazoxanide) is highly bound to plasma protein (> 99.9%). Therefore, it is necessary to monitor for adverse reactions when administering Nitazoxanide concurrently with other highly plasma protein-bound drugs with narrow therapeutic indices, as competition for binding sites may occur (e.g., warfarin).\n\nWarning\n\nNitazoxanide should be used with caution in patients with significant renal and hepatic impairment.\n\nResearch Objectives\n\nThe pandemic disease COVID-19 is particularly of major importance in Egypt where a heavy population lives. There is an acute need for comprehensive, continuous, and cost-effective health care delivery for infected people. Early detection and strategies for prevention of progression of COVID-19 would make a major difference for these patients and would also be economically beneficial for a resource-constrained country.\n\nThis research proposal was employed as a practical strategy for providing a suitable drug combination for possible treatment of COVID-19 infected patients. This drug combination may help to prevent the progression of respiratory complications. This can be achieved through different goals as follows:\n\nScreening of different drugs related to different pharmacological classes depending on its possible activity against COVID-19 virus.\nProviding cost-effective and easy-to-implement treatment strategy for infected patients and/or patients with high risk of developing respiratory failure.\nFinally, this clinical strategy remains an important goal in improving the Egyptian health state which can save people life and save a lot of money.\n\nScope of Work\n\nThe scope of work will be conducted through:\n\nUse of new drug combination of Hydroxychloroquine and Nitazoxanide for treatment of COVID-19 infected people. Since the two drugs exhibit different modes of action, it would be of value in containing the viral infection through targeting different sites in the pathophysiology of the disease.\nEvaluation of the effect of new drug combination on the symptomatic treatment of newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients through a clinical trial designed according to WHO (clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) when COVID-19 disease is suspected) interim guidance published at 13 March 2020.\nInvestigating the impact of new drug combination on the prevention of severe compilations such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04361318","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

A key host cellular protein required for the virus entry is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) whose expression has been demonstrated in many tissues including alveolar epithelial type II cells in lungs, oral mucosa and intestine, heart, kidney, endothelium and skin. ACE2-expressing cells can act as home cells and are prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection as ACE2 receptor facilitates cellular viral entry and replication. (1) Fang et al. has suggested that patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus may be at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as these patients are often treated with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers (ARBs), which have been previously suggested to increase ACE2 expression. (2) In another study by Sinha et al who analyzed a publicly available Connectivity Map (CMAP) dataset of pre/post transcriptomic profiles for drug treatment in cell lines for over 20,000 small molecules, isotretinoin was the strongest down-regulator of ACE 2 receptors. On the other hand, they found 6 drugs in CMAP that are currently being investigated in clinical trials for treating COVID-19 (chloroquine, thalidomide, methylprednisolone, losartan, lopinavir and ritonavir, from clinicaltrials.gov), none of which was found to significantly alter ACE2 expression (P>0.1) (3) Moreover, Wu et al, demonstrated that isotretinoin is a Potential papain like protease (PLpro) inhibitors which is a protein encoded by SARS-CoV-2 genes and considered one of the proteins that should be targeted in COVID-19 treatment by performing target-based virtual ligand screening. (4) In addition, isotretinoin was reported to increase CD4 counts and markedly decrease viremia in HIV positive patients suffering from acne vulgaris. (5) Currently, a study is running to evaluate the effect of isotretinoin on immune activation among HIV-1 infected subjects with incomplete CD4+ T cell recovery. (6) From this point, we can suggest that patient taking isotretinoin therapy may be immune against SARS-COV-2 and it can also have a therapeutic effect by prevention of further progression of the virus. Several potential mechanisms of action of Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 have been postulated and they are actually used in treatment regimens for COVID-19.(7) It was reported that chloroquine increase the blood level of isotretinoin, so lower doses is required when combined. We assume to test the efficacy of isotretinoin in treatment of COVID-19 versus combined therapy with the standard treatment of COVID-19.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nThe study is a randomized interventional comparative Phase III trial.

It has been previously used in both intranasal preparations against Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) as well as oral preparations in in-vitro studies of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), influenza H1N1, and rotavirus with good efficacy. This study will evaluate the efficacy of PVP-I as prophylaxis in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID19)-negative front-line health care workers and hospital patients.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus - 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been implicated in over 900,000 cases in the United States alone and has been found to affect as many as 28% of healthcare workers (HCW) worldwide. The most current statistics from Iceland, China, and Italy indicate that up to 50% of infected patients may be asymptomatic or with negligible symptomatology. This, added to the national shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) and the need to reuse PPE, lends to the significantly increased risk to healthcare providers.\n\nThe highest concentration of viral particles resides within the nasopharynx. The virus is thought to spread via respiratory droplets with the potential for transmission via inhalation of droplets, contact to the nose and mouth with infected materials, and airborne transmission. Given that frontline workers are involved in high-risk procedures including intubation, bronchoscopy, proning patients (which can lead to droplet production) and in some cases are reusing PPE, finding ways to reduce viral load or viral exposure are paramount.\n\nPovidone-iodine (PVP-I) is a broad-spectrum antiseptic with activity against bacteria, fungi, and viruses. It has been previously used in both intranasal preparations against MRSA as well as oral preparations in in-vitro studies of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, H1N1, and rotavirus with good efficacy.\n\nDue to the known breadth of its antiviral activity and similarities in molecular structure, it can be extrapolated that PVP-I should have robust activity against SARS-CoV-2. Eggers et al found that at a concentration of 1% there was a reduction of viral activity of 99.99% in in-vitro assays. At 2 minutes, a concentration of 0.23% was enough to reduce viral loads appreciably.\n\nPVP-I is widely used as an antiseptic and is well-tolerated and has been shown to have little to no effect on mucociliary clearance, olfaction, or thyroid function if iodine holidays are taken.\n\nIn this study, front line healthcare workers will be asked to complete a pre-participation survey and screened for COVID positivity. They will then be given premade PVP-I gargles and nasal sprays, as well as a calendar card to mark compliance. PVP-I nasal spray and gargle (10% diluted 1:30) will be used prior to the start of a shift, during \"lunch break\", and at the end of shift. First, the nasal spray will be sprayed in the nose (2 sprays each naris). For adequate coverage, the participant should be able to taste the iodine or see it in the back of the throat. This should be left in place for 30 seconds. Then, the participant will gargle the solution for 30 seconds and not have anything to eat or drink by mouth for 30 minutes. Treatment will continue for 3 weeks, or until the healthcare worker presents with COVID symptoms. Participants will then be tested for COVID positivity and asked to fill out a second questionnaire assessing study tolerability. At completion of the study, they will be asked to turn in their calendar card to assess how many applications they were able to complete.\n\nGiven the high rate of asymptomatic carriers, a second arm will also be planned for patients who have a 7+ day hospitalization or who are set to undergo a significant surgical procedure. These patients will be offered participation in the study as well and will be given the same questionnaire and undergo preoperative testing if they consent. For patients in the study group, PVIP gargle and nasal sprays will be applied preoperatively or shortly after admission and enrollment in the study for the non-operative group. The patients will then be retested in 2 weeks or as directed by the presentation of symptoms concerning for infection with SARS-CoV-2.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04364802","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Among 72,314 COVID-19 cases, case fatality rate (CFR) was 2.3% in total population, 8% in people aged 70 to 79, and 14.8% in those aged 80 and older. In the whole population, CFR was higher in people with comorbidities, ranging from 5-6% in persons with hypertension, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes or cancer, up to 10% in those with cardiovascular diseases. Sars-CoV-2 seems to be able to induce a functional exhaustion of specified T and NK lymphocyte subpopulations, breaking down antiviral immunity. One possible explanation is that the immune system of elderly people, might be exhausted by chronic stimulation associated with comorbidities and more susceptible to this Sars-CoV-2 effect. As a result, in these patients, the activation of the innate immune system might fail to produce an adequate adaptive response (i.e., virus-specific CD8+ T-cells). This results in persistent self-induced inflammation that eventually causes mortality.\nThe investigators hypothesize that transfusing convalescent plasma (containing neutralizing antibodies) at an early phase of COVID-19 infection could prevent or switch off the persistent inflammatory response elicited by the virus.\nThe objective of this study are:\nTo demonstrate the superiority of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) plus standard therapy (ST) over ST alone\nTo prevent progression of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients aged ≥65 with chronic comorbidities\nTo decrease viral load\nTo raise anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titer in recipients","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04374526","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

There is an urgent need for an effective regimen to cure this illness. Anecdotal data and some prospective results suggested a role of antimalarial drugs (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) in the treatment of this disease with best available data showing value of adding azithromycin. Based on drug repurposing studies done by our team and others, we identified the autophagy/apoptosis pathway as a major target for intervention. Based on in-silico and in-vitro models, sirolimus was identified as the drug that deserves urgent prioritization. The rational for combining sirolimus and hydroxychloroquine is explained in details in the study background below and a short video prepared by study PI (https://youtu.be/-zlOMXJp2hg). The evidence for using sirolimus for influenza is emphasized by a RCT that showed reduction of mechanical ventilation time by 50% (7 days on sirolimus arm vs 15 days on oseltamivir/steroids arm). Safe administration in human subjects is illustrated by multiple phase I/II clinical trials, performed in patients with cancer. COVID19-HOPE trial will randomize patients to 2 arms: HCQ/AZ (Arm A) and HCQ/SIR (Arm B). The main inclusion criteria is an RT-PCR test confirming infection with SARS-CoV-2 along with objective clinical criteria of disease (fever, tachypnea and/or hypoxemia). The primary endpoint of study will be Time To Clinical Improvement (TTCI), defined as time from randomization to resolution of the clinical features mentioned above (no fever, no tachypnea and no hypoxemia). In addition, secondary endpoints will include clinical failure by day 28 (need for intubation and/or death), QT interval prolongation, and adverse events. The estimated NNT based on Wilcoxon Mann Whitney comparison of TTCI in study arms is 58 patients (29 each arm). The study includes an adaptive plan, meaning that after different time points the study results will be evaluated and the NNT and randomization scheme (1:1 vs. others) will be evaluated and submitted to the IRB. Also, if one arm proves to be of no value, another regimen might be introduced based on available data. The study will recruit patients for a year and once approved by IRB and JFDA attempts to recruit other centers will be made (including national and regional centers).","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04374903","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

Preventing and reversing the cytokine storm may be the key to save the patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to possess a comprehensive powerful immunomodulatory function. This study aims to investigate whether MSC transplantation improves the outcome of 7 enrolled patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Beijing YouAn Hospital, China, from Jan 23, 2020 to Feb 16, 2020. The clinical outcomes, as well as changes of inflammatory and immune function levels and adverse effects of 7 enrolled patients were assessed for 14 days after MSC injection. MSCs could cure or significantly improve the functional outcomes of seven patients without observed adverse effects. The pulmonary function and symptoms of these seven patients were significantly improved in 2 days after MSC transplantation. Among them, two common and one severe patient were recovered and discharged in 10 days after treatment. After treatment, the peripheral lymphocytes were increased, the C-reactive protein decreased, and the overactivated cytokine-secreting immune cells CXCR3+CD4+ T cells, CXCR3+CD8+ T cells, and CXCR3+ NK cells disappeared in 3-6 days. In addition, a group of CD14+CD11c+CD11b(mid) regulatory DC cell population dramatically increased. Meanwhile, the level of TNF-alpha was significantly decreased, while IL-10 increased in MSC treatment group compared to the placebo control group. Furthermore, the gene expression profile showed MSCs were ACE2(-) and TMPRSS2(-) which indicated MSCs are free from COVID-19 infection. Thus, the intravenous transplantation of MSCs was safe and effective for treatment in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially for the patients in critically severe condition.","entry_type":"results_pub","url":"http://www.aginganddisease.org/EN/10.14336/AD.2020.0228#1","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

In this study, 10 severe patients confirmed by real-time viral RNA test were enrolled prospectively. One dose of 200 mL of convalescent plasma (CP) derived from recently recovered donors with the neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640 was transfused to the patients as an addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral agents. The primary endpoint was the safety of CP transfusion. The second endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters within 3 d after CP transfusion. The median time from onset of illness to CP transfusion was 16.5 d. After CP transfusion, the level of neutralizing antibody increased rapidly up to 1:640 in five cases, while that of the other four cases maintained at a high level (1:640). The clinical symptoms were significantly improved along with increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation within 3 d. Several parameters tended to improve as compared to pretransfusion, including increased lymphocyte counts (0.65 × 10(9)/L vs. 0.76 × 10(9)/L) and decreased C-reactive protein (55.98 mg/L vs. 18.13 mg/L). Radiological examinations showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesions within 7 d. The viral load was undetectable after transfusion in seven patients who had previous viremia. No severe adverse effects were observed. This study showed CP therapy was well tolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes through neutralizing viremia in severe COVID-19 cases. The optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of CP therapy, needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials.","entry_type":"results_pub","url":"https://www.pnas.org/content/117/17/9490","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Objective To investigate the effects of 6-week respiratory rehabilitation training on respiratory function, QoL, mobility and psychological function in elderly patients with COVID-19. Methods This paper reported the findings of an observational, prospective, quasi-experimental study, which totally recruited 72 participants, of which 36 patients underwent respiratory rehabilitation and the rest without any rehabilitation intervention. The following outcomes were measured: pulmonary function tests including plethysmography and diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), functional tests (6-min walk distance test), Quality of life (QoL) assessments (SF-36 scores), activities of daily living (Functional Independence Measure, FIM scores), and mental status tests (SAS anxiety and SDS depression scores). Results After 6 weeks of respiratory rehabilitation in the intervention group, there disclosed significant differences in FEV1(L), FVC(L), FEV1/FVC%, DLCO% and 6-min walk test. The SF-36 scores, in 8 dimensions, were statistically significant within the intervention group and between the two groups. SAS and SDS scores in the intervention group decreased after the intervention, but only anxiety had significant statistical significance within and between the two groups. Conclusions Six-week respiratory rehabilitation can improve respiratory function, QoL and anxiety of elderly patients with COVID-19, but it has little significant improvement on depression in the elderly.","entry_type":"results_pub","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1744388120304278","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

However, due to the low viral load in patient throat and the limitation of RT-PCR, significant numbers of false negative reports are inevitable, which should not be ignored. Methods: We explored the feasibility of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 from 57 clinical pharyngeal swab samples and compared with RT-PCR in terms of the sensitivity and accuracy. Among 57 samples, all of which were reported as negative nucleic acid by officially approved clinical RT-PCR detection, 43 samples were collected from suspected patients with fever in clinic, and 14 were from supposed convalescents who were about to discharge after treatment. The experiment was double-blind. Results: The lower limit of detection of the optimized ddPCR is at least 500 times lower than that of RT-PCR. The overall accuracy of ddPCR for clinical detection is 94.3 %. 33 out of 35 negative pharyngeal swab samples checked by RT-PCR were correctly judged by ddPCR based on the follow-up investigation. In addition, 9 out of 14 (64.2 %) supposed convalescents with negative nucleic acid test twice by RT-PCR were positive by ddPCR detection. Conclusions: ddPCR shows superiority for clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2 to reduce the false negatives, which could be a powerful complement to the current standard RT-PCR. Before the ddPCR to be approved for diagnosis, the current clinical practice that the convalescent continues to be quarantined for 2 weeks is reasonable and necessary.","entry_type":"preprint","url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.02.29.20029439","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Results Twenty cases were treated in this study and showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage at D-6 compared to controls, and much lower than reported average carrying duration of untreated patients in the literature. Azithromycin added to Hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination. Conclusion : Hydroxychloroquine is significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in patients with COVID-19 and its effect is reinforced by Azithromycin.","entry_type":"preprint","url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.16.20037135","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

Methods We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label multicenter trial involving adult patients with COVID-19. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive conventional therapy plus Umifenovir (Arbidol) (200mg*3/day) or Favipiravir (1600mg*2/first day followed by 600mg*2/day) for 10 days. The primary outcome was clinical recovery rate of Day 7. Latency to relief for pyrexia and cough, the rate of auxiliary oxygen therapy (AOT) or noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NMV) were the secondary outcomes. Safety data were collected for 17 days. Results 240 enrolled COVID-19 patients underwent randomization; 120 patients were assigned to receive Favipiravir (116 assessed), and 120 to receive Arbidol (120 assessed). Clinical recovery rate of Day 7 does not significantly differ between Favipiravir group (71/116) and Arbidol group (62/120) (P=0.1396, difference of recovery rate: 0.0954; 95% CI: -0.0305 to 0.2213).

Self-collected swabs offer many advantages provided detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses is not compromised. METHODS In a prospective study, patients attending dedicated COVID-19 collection clinics were offered the option to first self-collect (SC) nasal and throat swabs prior to health worker collection (HC). Two different laboratory services participated, with HC at Site 1 collecting nasal and throat swabs and at Site 2 nasopharyngeal (NP) and throat swabs. Samples were analysed for SARS-CoV-2 as well as common respiratory viruses. Concordance of results between methods was assessed using Cohens kappa ({kappa}). RESULTS Of 236 patients sampled by HC and SC, 25 had COVID-19 (24 by HC and 25 by SC) and 63 had other respiratory viruses (56 by HC and 58 by SC). SC was highly concordant with HC ({kappa} = 0.890) for all viruses including SARS-CoV-2 and more concordant than HC to positive results by any method ({kappa} = 0.959 vs 0.933). CONCLUSIONS Self-collection of throat and nasal swabs offers a reliable alternative to health worker collection for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and other common respiratory viruses. High viral load of SARS-CoV-2 throughout the respiratory tract and sensitive molecular methods may explain these findings.

Conclusion: In this randomized pilot study, 99mTc-MDP had an effective inhibitory effect on the inflammatory disease progression for the therapy of COVID-19, and it can accelerate the absorption of pulmonary inflammation in a short period of time during the process of treatment.","entry_type":"preprint","url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.07.20054767","is_trial":"yes"},

Design Multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial. Setting 16 government-designated COVID-19 treatment centers in China through 11 to 29 in February 2020. Participants 150 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. 75 patients were assigned to HCQ plus SOC and 75 were assigned to SOC alone (control group). Interventions HCQ was administrated with a loading dose of 1, 200 mg daily for three days followed by a maintained dose of 800 mg daily for the remaining days (total treatment duration: 2 or 3 weeks for mild/moderate or severe patients, respectively). Main outcome measures The primary endpoint was the 28-day negative conversion rate of SARS-CoV-2. The assessed secondary endpoints were negative conversion rate at day 4, 7, 10, 14 or 21, the improvement rate of clinical symptoms within 28-day, normalization of C-reactive protein and blood lymphocyte count within 28-day. Primary and secondary analysis was by intention to treat. Adverse events were assessed in the safety population. Results The overall 28-day negative conversion rate was not different between SOC plus HCQ and SOC group (Kaplan-Meier estimates 85.4% versus 81.3%, P=0.341). Negative conversion rate at day 4, 7, 10, 14 or 21 was also similar between the two groups. No different 28-day symptoms alleviation rate was observed between the two groups. A significant efficacy of HCQ on alleviating symptoms was observed when the confounding effects of anti-viral agents were removed in the post-hoc analysis (Hazard ratio, 8.83, 95%CI, 1.09 to 71.3). This was further supported by a significantly greater reduction of CRP (6.986 in SOC plus HCQ versus 2.723 in SOC, milligram/liter, P=0.045) conferred by the addition of HCQ, which also led to more rapid recovery of lymphopenia, albeit no statistical significance. Adverse events were found in 8.8% of SOC and 30% of HCQ recipients with two serious adverse events. The most common adverse event in the HCQ recipients was diarrhea (10%). Conclusions The administration of HCQ did not result in a higher negative conversion rate but more alleviation of clinical symptoms than SOC alone in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 without receiving antiviral treatment, possibly through anti-inflammatory effects. Adverse events were significantly increased in HCQ recipients but no apparently increase of serious adverse events.

We wanted to compare specimen types and collection methods to explore if a simpler to collect specimen type could expand access to testing. Methods: We recruited individuals recently tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection through a testing program (drive-through). In homes of participants, we assessed the performance of self-collected oral fluid swab specimens with and without clinician supervision, clinician-supervised self-collected mid-turbinate (nasal) swab specimens, and clinician-collected nasopharyngeal swab specimens. We tested specimens with a validated reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and measured cycle threshold values. Symptom status and date of onset of symptoms was also recorded for each participant. Results: We recruited 45 participants. The median age of study participant was 42 years old (Interquartile range, 31 to 52 years). Of the participants, 29 had at least one specimen test positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of those, 21 (73%) of 29 reported active symptoms. By specimen type and home-based collection method, clinician-supervised self-collected oral fluid swab specimens detected 26 (90%) of 29 infected individuals, clinician-supervised self-collected nasal swab specimens detected 23 (85%) of 27, clinician-collected posterior nasopharyngeal swab specimens detected 23 (79%) of 29, and unmonitored self-collected oral fluid swab specimens detected 19 (66%) of 29. Despite nasopharyngeal swabs being considered the gold standard, 4 participants tested negative by clinician-collected nasopharyngeal swab and positive by the 3 other specimen types. Additionally, false negative results by each sample type were seen to generally not overlap. Conclusions: Supervised self-collected oral fluid and nasal swab specimens performed similarly to, if not better than clinician-collected nasopharyngeal swab specimens for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. No sample type captured all SARS-CoV-2 infections, suggesting potential heterogeneity in the distribution of viral load in different parts of the respiratory tract between individuals. Supervised self-collection performed comparably to clinician collection and would allow for rapid expansion of testing capacity in the United States by reducing the need for trained healthcare workers, reducing exposure of healthcare workers, and reducing the amount of PPE (personal protective equipment) being used for testing during a critical shortage.","entry_type":"preprint","url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.11.20062372","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

Serologic tests based on ELISA have been developed and evaluated as useful complements to PCR in these situations. However, there is scarce information about the usefulness of rapid tests based on immunochromatography. The aim of our study was to analyze the diagnostic performance of these rapid tests in COVID-19 pneumonia patients. Methods: We evaluated an immunochromatographic test (AllTest COV-19 IgG / IgM kit) which detects IgG and IgM antibodies. First, we performed a validation of the serologic test using serum samples from 45 healthy control patients (group 1) and 55 confirmed by PCR cases of COVID-19 (group 2) in order to establish the specificity and sensitivity, respectively. Then we prospectively employed the test in 63 patients diagnosed with pneumonia of unknown etiology that were SARS-CoV-2 negative by PCR (group 3), to establish the diagnostic performance in these patients. Results: All patients from group 1 (healthy controls) resulted negative for the serologic test (specificity = 100%). Regarding group 2 (PCR positive) patients, the median time from the onset of symptoms was 11 days and the test was positive for either IgM or IgG in 26 out of 55 patients (overall sensitivity = 47.3%). However, in those patients with 14 days or more from onset of symptoms, the sensitivity was 73.9%. Regarding group 3 patients, the median days from onset of symptoms was 17 and the test was positive in 56 out of 63 patients (88.9% positivity rate). In these group 3 patients with 14 days or more from onset of symptoms, the positivity rate was 91.1%. Conclusions: Our study shows that serologic rapid tests can be used as a complement of PCR to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection after 14 days from the onset of symptoms. These immunochromatographic devices could be especially useful in hospitalized patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology with 14 or more days from the onset of symptoms and in whom the PCR has been negative.","entry_type":"preprint","url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.11.20062158","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"no","is_observational":"yes","is_duplicate":false},

The rationale for tocilizumab is: 1) Patients with respiratory failure caused by COVID-19 have a dismal prognosis; 2) The hyper inflammatory state in COVID-19 patients is a main reason for respiratory insufficiency and dead; 3) Tocilizumab is an effective drug to control cytokine storms without hampering the functional immune response; 4) Extensive experience is present with tocilizumab in the clinical setting with cytokine release syndromes (e.g. after CAR-T cell therapy).\nThe rationale to apply tocilizumab in the pre-emptive phase i.e. at the moment of hypoxia (defined according to cytokine release syndrome (CRS) grade II), or other signs of hyperinflammation (ferritin >2000 μg/L or doubling of serum ferritin in 20-48 hours), is to modulate the cytokine storm at an early phase before the phase of respiratory failure is reached.

Although there is no proven therapy to reduce viral replication in Covid19, recent studies from our department have discovered that the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib reinforces the endothelial barrier and prevents vascular leak in inflammatory conditions, while leaving the immune response intact. We hypothesize that reversing vascular leak is an effective approach to reduce disease burden and consumption of medical resources.\nObjective: To test whether treatment with oral imatinib reduce disease burden and consumption of medical resources.\nStudy design: A randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, clinical trial.\nStudy population: Patients (>18years) with proven Covid19 infection, admitted to the hospital with hypoxemic respiratory failure (SaO2<92% or kPa<8 on room air), with a study population of 386 patients (193/arm).\nIntervention (if applicable): The intervention group will receive a starting dose of 800mg oral imatinib, followed by 400mg od during 10 days. The control group will receive a similar dosing schedule with a placebo.\nMain study parameters/endpoints: The main study parameter is the time to liberation from ventilation and supplemental oxygen and alive during a 28day period after randomization.\nNature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: Participation involves randomization to either the intervention or the placebo group. In both groups patients will undergo blood sampling at 9 time-points, at each time-point 1 or 4 tubes of 5mL will be drawn. Additional tests include a viral swab from the throat at 2 time-points, and an ECG at 5 time-points. Part of these interventions are part of routine care. Physical discomfort associated with participation involves swallowing of tablets, and side effects of the study medication, which are considered mild (predominantly gastro-intestinal discomfort). Anticipated benefits from the study medication involve faster recovery from Covid19 and a lower risk for ICU admission or death.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://trialregister.nl/trial/8491","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

This virus can infect the respiratory (breathing) system. Some people do not have symptoms but can carry the virus and pass it on to others. People who have developed the condition may develop a fever and/or a continuous cough among other symptoms. This can develop into pneumonia. Pneumonia is a chest infection where the small air pockets of the lungs, called alveoli, fill with liquid and make it more difficult to breathe.\nIn 2020, the virus has spread to many countries around the world and neither a vaccine against the virus or specific treatment for COVID-19 has yet been developed. As of March 2020, it is advised that people minimize travel and social contact, and regularly wash their hands to reduce the spread of the virus.\nGroups who are at a higher risk from infection with the virus, and therefore of developing COVID-19, include people aged over 70 years, people who have long-term health conditions (such as asthma or diabetes), people who have a weakened immune system and people who are pregnant. People in these groups, and people who might come into contact with them, can reduce this risk by following the up-to-date advice to reduce the spread of the virus.\nThere are currently no available vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. Although there have been some suggestions for untested treatments that could be added to the usual care in hospitals, none is known to help. The World Health Organization (WHO) is, therefore, organizing a study in many countries in which some of these untested treatments are compared with each other, to discover whether any do help. The study treatments are remdesivir, chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir plus ritonavir, and interferon-beta. Some are given as daily pills, and some as daily injections.","entry_type":"registration","url":"http://isrctn.com/ISRCTN83971151","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

","abstract":"Plain English Summary\nBackground and study aims:\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged at the end of 2019 as a novel coronavirus. It has been declared as a global pandemic. Some people develop no symptoms, whilst others develop worsening breathing problems and may die. Throughout the world, a huge burden has been placed on intensive care units due to the number of people with worsening breathing problems that need to be placed on a ventilator (breathing machine). It is essential that we avoid ventilator use wherever possible to allow as many individuals as possible to benefit.\n\nIn this trial, we will test whether two treatments are better than standard treatment at preventing people from dying or needing to go on a ventilator.\n\nWho can participate?\nAdult patients with suspected or proven COVID-19 admitted to hospital\n\nWhat does the study involve?\nIndividuals that have or are believed to have COVID-19 that are requiring a certain amount of oxygen will be randomly allocated to receive one of three interventions. In the first group, participants will be placed on a tight-fitting mask (CPAP). In the second group, participants will receive oxygen blown quickly up their nose by a machine (HFNO). In the third arm, participants will receive standard treatment (a normal oxygen mask). Both CPAP and HFNO are already used routinely in the NHS for other conditions.\n\nDue to the urgency of treatment, we plan to enrol potential participants immediately and seek their consent later. This is because many participants are likely to be confused and due to COVID-19 visiting will be restricted. In addition, for the treatments to be effective, they will need to be started as quickly as possible to have the best outcomes.\n\nWe will record the need for people to be placed on a ventilator and death over a 30-day period. We will also see how long people spend on intensive care units and in hospital.\n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating?\nThe planned interventions are already in routine use across NHS Hospitals. The interventions (HFNO and CPAP) may help to reduce the need for patients to go on a ventilator. However, they have some side-effects such as nausea, dryness to the mouth and nose, and pressure sores to the face.\n\nWhere is the study run from?\nThe trial is led by the University of Warwick Clinical Trials Unit\n\nWhen is the study starting and how long is it expected to run for?\nFrom March 2020 to May 2021\n\nWho is funding the study?\nThe National Institute for Health Research (UK)\n\nWho is the main contact?\nUnfortunately, this study is not recruiting public volunteers at this time. This is because the research isn’t ready for volunteers yet or the researchers are directly identifying volunteers in certain areas or hospitals. Please do not contact the research team as they will not be able to respond.

The UK New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG) advised that several possible treatments should be evaluated, including lopinavir + ritonavir (Kaletra), interferon β, hydroxychloroquine and low-dose corticosteroids. These groups also advised that other treatments will soon emerge that require evaluation. A World Health Organization (WHO) expert group issued broadly similar advice.\nThis study aims to compare several different treatments that may be useful for patients with COVID-19. Some are tablets and some are injections. Although these treatments show promise, nobody knows if any of them will turn out to be more effective in helping patients recover than the usual hospital standard of care (which all patients will receive). At present, it is not known whether any of these are effective in treating COVID-19. However, the side-effects are well-known from other uses and doctors will be able to monitor patients appropriately.","entry_type":"registration","url":"http://isrctn.com/ISRCTN50189673","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a widely used anti-malarial drug showing great promise in treating COVID-19 in preclinical studies. The intensive care physicians at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital (RBWH) have chosen to treat all COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU with HCQ. The dose of HCQ used in virtually every other hospital is the same as used for malaria. However, critically ill patients with renal failure and other problems commonly require different doses of many drugs. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the dosing of HCQ for critically ill COVID-19 patients requires adjustment, in order to ensure the safety of practice at RBWH, Inclusion criteria is suspected or proven severe COVID-19 infections admitted to the RBWH ICU. Data will be routinely collected as part of standard ICU practice. The outcome of this study will potentially be of critical importance in the interpretation of results of the large randomised comparative trials of HCT using fixed dosing currently underway.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://anzctr.org.au/ACTRN12620000447954.aspx","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

In the Dutch treatment protocol guideline (SWAB) designated treatment options are chloroquine base (CQ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and the standard treatment alone. CQ and HCQ are implemented because of their in vitro activity, results from small animal studies, and anecdotal patient’s data. There are no published randomized studies with these medications in patients with disease caused by any coronavirus.\n\nObjective: To evaluate if treatment with one of two antiviral agents versus no antiviral treatment results in less disease progression in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 who require hospital admission.\n\nStudy design: Multicentre, cluster-randomized cross-over, open label trial.\nHospitals will be randomly allocated to one of 3 treatment arms in sequential periods of one week: chloroquine base versus hydroxychloroquine versus no antiviral agent without any drug presumed active against SARS-COV-2. Patients will be treated based on the date of admission.\n\nStudy population: Adults aged of 18 years and older with moderate to severe, with a NEWS-2 score ≤ 5, laboratory confirmed COVID-19, who require hospital admission in a ward outside the Medium Care/Intensive Care.\n\nIntervention (if applicable): Depending on the treatment arm, the study subject will be treated with one of the two antiviral agents (chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine). Patients in the control group will not receive any antiviral treatment active against SARS-Cov-2.\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints: Disease progression defined as a NEWS-2 score ≥ 7 within 14 days, or admission to Medium Care or Intensive Care Unit, or death.\n\nNature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: Burden: The burden for the patient will be the initial inclusion in this trial and the possible telephonic contact after discharge from the hospital. All other data will be collected through routine care.\nRisk and benefit: All three arms are currently implemented as possible treatment for COVID-19, without preference for a treatment. Therefore patients are not exposed to an additional risk. The possible benefit of one arm will be accounted for with monitoring.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://trialregister.nl/trial/8490","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

The doctor will then check whether the volunteer is eligible to take part. This will involve taking a medical history, performing a physical examination, taking blood tests, urine tests, and measuring blood pressure and temperature.\nThe doctor will then write to the volunteers own GP to enquire about their medical health. If all the inclusion criteria are met and none of the exclusion criteria are present then the volunteer is invited to return for vaccination. Due to the need for rapid delivery of this study, there will be minimal flexibility around appointment dates.\n\nBefore vaccination, volunteers will be asked about their recent health to ensure that they are still medically fit. They will have blood tests taken and participants in groups 1, 2 and 4 will be randomised (1:1) to receive either ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or MenACWY. Group 3 participants will not be randomised and therefore not blinded\n\nParticipants from group 1 or 3 will be vaccinated first. The first volunteer to receive the IMP will be vaccinated ahead of any other participants. The investigators and/or chair of DSMB will assess there are no safety concerns within 48 hours (±24h) post vaccination. The next 3 volunteers will be vaccinated with the IMP at least 1 hour apart. The investigators and/or chair of DSMB will assess there are no safety concerns within 48 hours (±24h) post vaccination. If there are no safety concerns from the first 4 participants receiving IMP, further participants will be vaccinated with the IMP.","entry_type":"registration","url":"http://isrctn.com/ISRCTN15281137","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Both interventions are provided in a telehealth format as a response to the global pandemic, COVID-19. The purpose is to determine whether the novel intervention is more effective as well as if it is more efficient (as it is offered in a virtual group format). We plan to recruit 58 participants who have been confirmed with COVID-19 and referred to home rehabilitation services at Flinders Medical Centre Division of Rehabilitation Aged and Palliative care. At the completion of the study, we expect to be able to describe the functional and social impacts of a telerehabilitation interventions for individuals confirmed with COVID-19 receiving home rehabilitation services.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://anzctr.org.au/ACTRN12620000443998.aspx","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

These changes may cause some problems. For women who perceive menopause as the first step of old age, loss of physical strength, energy, attraction and fertility, menopause can also lead to anxiety. In addition to these, they are among the emotional changes in the menopausal period in symptoms such as hypersensitivity to events, fatigue, and insomnia. Sometimes it can even be seen in psychological disorders such as melancholy and depression. The new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), which appeared in Wuhan in December 2019, started to appear in different countries soon after. All countries have taken measures to prevent the spread of this virus. To this end, Turkey remains at home on March 21, 2020, and has commissioned social isolation measures. Studies investigating the effects of social isolation show that psychological and physical problems occur in individuals. Studies have shown that yoga and mindfulness programs have an impact on people's anxiety, depression, and the ability to control themselves. The purpose of this study; To investigate the effectiveness of telerehabilitation based yoga and mindfulness programs on psychological resilience, physical awareness and physical activity in postmenopausal women in social isolation due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Using telerehabilitation-based home programs aims to use an innovative model.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04346979","is_covid":"no","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

All countries in the world are taking some precautions to prevent the spread of this epidemic disease, which World Health Organization (WHO) declared as \"epidemic\". Staying home and social isolation are among these precautions. For this purpose, it began to implement the curfew for all individuals on 10 March 2020, Turkey. However, not leaving the house and social isolation bring about the limitation of physical activity. Physical activity (PA) is defined as anybody's movement produced by WHO by contraction of skeletal muscles. Studies investigating the relationship between social isolation and health behavior report consistent findings.

Traditional exercises; It takes place outdoors in gyms or rehabilitation centers. However, with the increase in the time we spent at home due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic, technologies have been used as an alternative method. Home-based exercise programs are also a viable solution to prevent various health problems that may be encountered in this direction. The decrease in physical performance is associated with loss of muscle strength, low quality of life, emotionalization, comorbidity, premature death, and increased health costs. When today's conditions are evaluated, technology-supported education programs are effective in increasing motivation for physical support.

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an important component of the renin-angiotensin system, serves as the binding site of SARS-CoV-2 and facilitates host cell entry in the lungs. In experimental models, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been shown to increase ACE2 expression in several organs, potentially promoting viral cell invasion, although these findings are not consistent across studies.

The World Health Organization (WHO) designated the respiratory disease as coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on February 12, 2020. Numerous reports have since characterized the COVID-19 clinical syndrome, ranging from asymptomatic/mild disease to severe disease leading to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation (i.e., ARDS, multi-organ failure, sepsis, and death).\n\nA safe, effective, and inexpensive therapy is urgently needed, one that can alter the natural course of the disease process and reduce strain on healthcare systems. High Dose Intravenous Vitamin C is a safe and possibly effective treatment for ARDS and has been described to be effective for ARDS of viral origin.\n\nA double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized control trial from our institution involving 167 patients with ARDS who were randomized to receive 50 mg/kg every 6 hours of HDIVC for 4 days versus placebo showed a statistically significant difference in 28-day all-cause mortality. The 28-day mortality was 29.8% in the vitamin C group versus 46.3% in the placebo group, although this was a secondary outcome.\n\nThis can be translated as a Number Needed to Treat (NNT) of 6-8 patients to save one life from ARDS. The statistical effect on mortality remained up to 60-days following trial completion.\n\nWe, therefore, cannot withhold the treatment from patients with ARDS. It remains unknown if HDIVC given early can prevent the progression to ARDS and if it is effective in COVID-19 ARDS.\n\nThe first study, published in 1986, treated 16 ARDS patients with intravenous vitamin C (1000 mg IV every 6 hours) plus antioxidants versus 16 ARDS patients who received the standard care at that time (i.e., control group). There was a reduction in mortality in the vitamin C group: 37% versus 71% in the standard care group (p<0.01). A phase I trial in 2014 proved that plasma vitamin C in patients with severe sepsis and ARDS were low, almost at scorbutic levels and that HDIVC administration had a dose-dependent effect in the prevention of multi-organ failure, as measured by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores.\n\nPatients who received a total of 200 mg/kg/day of HDIVC for 4 days (administered in 50 mg/kg/dose, every 6 hours), had significantly lower organ failure scores than placebo, and even lower scores than the patients who received lower-doses of IV vitamin C (50 mg/kg/day administered at 12.5 mg/kg/dose, every 6 hours for 4 days). In this trial, the patients in the HDIVC group (200 mg/kg/day) achieved plasma levels up to 3,000 µM on day 4.\n\nTo assess the treatment effect of a 72-hour intravenous vitamin C infusion protocol (100 mg/kg every 8 hours) in patients with hypoxemia and suspected COVID-19 (Novel Coronavirus ID-19). In the course of performing this phase 2 trial we will explore three following hypotheses:\n\nPrimary Endpoint: HDIVC infusion will increase 28-day ventilator-free days. Secondary Endpoint A: HDIVC infusion will reduce 28-day all-cause hospital mortality.\n\nSecondary Endpoint B: HDIVC infusion will significantly increase acute inflammation-free days (defined as CRP >=10 mg/L) among COVID-19 patients.\n\nSecondary Endpoint C: HDIVC infusion will be safe, as demonstrated by organ-failure-free days up to 28 days.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04344184","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and may lead to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome in affected individuals. No therapeutic intervention has yet been approved for COVID-19, and initial interventional studies with single agents showed only minimal improvement in outcome or were not convincing in design. Therefore, the CLOCC trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of a combination therapy consisting of hydroxychloroquine, which was used already as single agent with some effect, together with camostat mesylate in hospitalized patients with moderate COVID-19 infection. The rationale for this combination therapy stems from the observation that hydroxychloroquine interferes with viral entry and replication through several mechanisms including changes in endosomal pH and in glycosylation of the ACE2 receptor, which serves as entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Camostat acts as inhibitor of the host cell serine protease TMPRSS2, which is needed to prime the viral S protein for cell entry. Participants will be recruited in a total of 6 German centers, and the trial will be randomized (1:1) and enrolled in either the hydroxychloroquine + placebo or the hydroxychloroquine + camostat arm (7-day treatment). The trial will be carried out in a double-blinded fashion. The primary efficacy outcome is the number of patients discharged by day 14 (status 1 and 2 of a 7-point ordinal clinical status scale). Several secondary outcomes regarding efficacy but also safety will be evaluated. Exploratory endpoints include analysis of viral titers and the emergence of viral resistance in response to therapy.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04338906","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

We hypothesize that dexamethasone (20 mg for 5 days followed by 10 mg for 5 days) combined with 600 mg per day dose of hydroxychloroquine for 10 days will reduce the 28-day mortality compared to hydroxychloroquine alone in patients with severe ARDS related COVID-19.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic causing COVID-19 disease affects hundreds of thousands of patients. Of these, 5% will present with acute respiratory failure, the most severe form of which is Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Hospital mortality affects 45% of patients with severe ARDS. The improvement in mortality associated with ARDS seems largely explained by the reduction in lesions induced by mechanical ventilation, in particular a tidal volume (Vt) set at 6 ml / kg of the weight predicted by the size associated with a plateau pressure must not exceed 30 cm of water. Unfortunately and despite the application of these recommendations, ARDS related COVID-19 is associated with a mortality of 65%. About 42% of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonitis will develop ARDS and the onset of ARDS is rapid after admission with a median of 2 days. Interestingly, a study reported that patients suffering from ARDS and having received corticosteroids had a mortality rate of 46% (23 out of 50) compared to 61.8% (21 out of 34) in patients who did not receive corticosteroids. However, this difference was not significant (P = 0.15). The survival curve showed, however, that the administration of corticosteroids (Methylprednisolone) reduced the risk of death (Hazard ratio: 0.38 (95% confidence interval 0.20-0.72); P = 0.003). The authors concluded that a randomized study was necessary to confirm this impression.\n\nThe theoretical justification for treatment with corticosteroids is related to the recognition of the inflammatory syndrome as a factor in the development of an uncontrolled and harmful fibroproliferative phase. It seems certain that late administration (beyond the 14th day after the start of ARDS) is deleterious in patients by increasing mortality. However, a recent study shows that early administration of dexamethasone (within 30 hours after the start of ARDS) is associated with an increase of ventilator-free days and a decrease in mortality at 2 months.\n\nIn COVID-19 disease, there is also a cytokine storm and an intense inflammatory reaction. Currently the use of corticosteroids is not recommended during a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Administration of corticosteroids may delay elimination of the virus. Recently, a preliminary study reported that the administration of hydroxychloroquine (200mg x3 per day) decreased or even made disappear the viral load. This clinical study appears to corroborate an experimental study. However, hydroxychloroquine can have cardiac toxicity which, although rare, can be serious.\n\nIn summary:\n\nThe appearance of an ARDS during a COVID-19 is burdened with a mortality of 65%\nThe viral load has decreased when ARDS is present\nThe use of hydroxychloroquine makes it possible to significantly reduce the viral load\nEarly administration of corticosteroids seems beneficial in ARDS","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04347980","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

A portion of individuals with COVID-19 experience life-threatening hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation. Management of hypoxia in this population is complicated by contraindication of non-invasive ventilation and limitations in access to mechanical ventilation and critical care staff given the clinical burden of disease. Positional therapy is readily deployable and may ultimately be used to treat COVID-19 related respiratory failure in resources limited settings; and, it has been demonstrated to improve oxygenation and is easy to implement in the clinical setting.\n\nThe overall goal of this randomized controlled trial is to establish the feasibility of performing a randomized trial using a simple, minimally invasive positional therapy approach to improve hypoxia and reduce progression to mechanical ventilation. The objectives are to examine the effectiveness and feasibility of maintaining an inclined position in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 associated hypoxemic respiratory failure. The investigators hypothesize that (1) oxyhemoglobin saturation will improve with therapy, (2) participants will tolerate and adhere to the intervention, and that (3) participants who adhere to positional therapy will have reduced rates of mechanical ventilation at 72 hours. If successful, this feasibility trial will demonstrate that a simple, readily deployed nocturnal postural maneuver is well tolerated and reverses underlying defects in ventilation and oxygenation due to COVID-19. It will also inform the design of a pivotal Phase III trial with estimates of sample sizes for clinically relevant outcomes.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nStudy Design: The investigators will conduct a pilot study to examine the acute effects of inclined posture on oxyhemoglobin saturation and the feasibility of conducting randomized controlled clinical trial among patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19-associated hypoxia.\n\nIn a subgroup of participants, the investigators will examine the acute effect of postural therapy (15-degree incline on hospital beds) on oxyhemoglobin saturation among hypoxic patients to establish a biologic response. The investigators will enroll a subset of participants (n=16) who will lie supine on hospital beds, which will be placed in the horizontal (flat) or 15-degree inclined (reverse Trendelenberg) orientation in random order. During this time, the investigators will continuous record pulse oximetry, pulse rate and variations in peripheral arterial tone with WatchPAT one devices. Subjects will be visually monitored for work of breathing during this time. If work of breathing becomes excessive, as defined as a sustain respiratory rate of >25 and an increase of >5 breaths per minute from baseline, or oxygenation decreases below 88% for > 30 seconds in the inclined position, then maneuvers will be stopped. If the patient meets these criteria in the flat position, then the investigators sit the patient upright, and allow breathing to return to baseline before examining responses in the inclined position.\n\nThe investigators will randomize participants to have beds placed in 15-degree incline or usual care (ad-lib positioning) for 72 hours. During the first night in a subgroup of participants, the investigators will record oxygenation, sleep wake state and markers of sympathetic activity with WatchPAT One devices, which can obtain cardiopulmonary parameters with high temporal resolution. The investigators will obtain vital signs from the data warehouse, which archives telemetry data with a maximum sampling frequency of 1 minute. The investigators will record adherence with continuous accelerometry sensors placed on the bed rails and on the anterolateral surface of participants' chests to measure bed and participants' positions, respectively. Aside from position, participants will receive usual treatment for COVID-19.\n\nThe investigators will enroll in 3 phases. At the end of each phase, the investigators will assess for completion of milestones for proceeding to the subsequent phase, as detailed below:\n\nPilot Study: The investigators will pilot the study in 16 participants to obtain critical information on logistics of conducting the trial including performance of recording instruments in a biocontainment environment, to examine the feasibility of the intervention, perform preliminary safety evaluations to ascertain potential harm and to determine whether the intervention results in a meaningful difference in body position.\nPhase II RCT: If inclined therapy results in a difference in body position and no significant safety issues were detected, the investigators will conduct a phase II randomized-controlled trial (RCT) in 70 participants (see sample size calculation below) to estimate the effect size of inclined position on rates of intubation and determine sample size for a Phase III trial.\n\nRandomization will be occur in both phases and will be stratified by study phase and study site.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04344561","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

Hypovitaminosis D is common in Winter (October to March) at Northern latitudes above 20 degrees North, and from April to September at Southern latitudes beyond 20 degrees below the equator.\n\nIn the past, coronaviruses and influenza viruses have exhibited very high seasonality, with outbreaks occurring preferentially during the Winter. The Covid-19 pandemic is indeed more severe above Winter latitudes of 20 degrees, while it remains until now less severe in the Southern hemisphere, with a much lower number of deaths.\n\nPreclinical research suggests that the SARS-Cov-2 virus enters cells via the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Coronavirus viral replication downregulates ACE2, thereby dysregulating the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and leading to a cytokine storm in the host, causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\nResearch also shows that vitamin D plays a role in balancing RAS and in reducing lung damage. On the contrary, chronic hypovitaminosis D induces pulmonary fibrosis through activation of RAS. Similarly, hypovitaminosis D has been strongly associated in the literature with ARDS, as well as with a pejorative vital prognosis in resuscitation but also in geriatric units, and with various comorbidities associated to deaths during SARS-Cov-2 infections. Conversely, vitamin D supplementation has been reported to increase immunity and to reduce inflammatory responses and the risk of acute respiratory tract infections.\nHigh-dose oral vitamin D3 supplementation has been shown to decrease short-term mortality in resuscitation patients with severe hypovitaminosis D (17% absolute risk reduction). It is considered safe to take oral vitamin D supplementation at doses up to 10,000 IU/day for short periods, particularly in older adults, i.e. a population that is mostly affected by hypovitaminosis D and who should receive at least 1,500 IU of vitamin D daily to ensure satisfactory vitamin D status.\nVitamin D supplementation is mentioned as a potentially interesting treatment for SARS-Cov-2 infection but on a scientific basis with a low level of evidence until now.\nWe hypothesize that high-dose vitamin D supplementation improves the prognosis of older patients diagnosed with COVID-19 compared to a standard dose of vitamin D.\n\n\n\n","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04344041","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

ARDS is characterized by the loss of pulmonary tissue compliance and severe hypoxia. The central pathophysiologic changes of COVID-19+ ARDS are dysregulated inflammation within the alveolar space and altered permeability of the alveolar-capillary barrier. The public health impact of this COVID-19+ ARDS is considerable with a large number of ARDS cases that need to be treated currently on German Intensive Care Units. To date, the associated mortality ranges between 30 to 50%. In the ongoing COVID-19 crisis cases of ARDS will still increase and pose a significant challenge to the German Medical System. Despite the emerging understanding of COVID-19+ ARDS, treatment only remains to be symptomatic using mechanical ventilation, prone positioning and in severe cases of hypoxia extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Current evidence generated by clinical trials demonstrates that patients with ARDS should be referred to a specialized center to receive expert treatment. The use of ECMO might have a beneficial effect on overall patient outcome, yet this has not been proven by clinical trials and to date ECMO is recommended as measure of last resort in the current ARDS treatment guidelines. The timing of ECMO placement to relieve hypoxia is an important question for the treating clinician but is not well studied to date. This might also have impact on the long-term functional outcome of patients. In addition, evidence about the role of ECMO in the outcome of COVID-19+ patients might have significant impact on the referral of patients to a specialized center and is important for the treating physician. Therefore, the investigators want to pursue the questions whether early ECMO placement is superior than the placement of ECMO as a rescue measure, and whether this could result in improved overall outcome of patients with COVID-19+ ARDS.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04341285","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

The results of the diagnostic RT-PCR tests will be confronted with: (i) the results of immune monitoring of at least 30 immunological parameters in leukocytes (number and phenotype of: PMN cells, monocytes, T- and B-lymphocytes and NK-cells) and in plasma (levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, GM-CSF, TNF-a, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-IA, IL-1, CRP, Type IFN-alpha and IFN-betta), analyzed by automated flow cytometry software such as tSNE, SPADE, FlowSOM, among others (see attached file); and (ii) the daily recording of data on the presence or absence of signs and symptoms associated with SARS-Cov-2 infection. For the recording of immune monitoring 20mL blood samples will be taken at eight-time points (day 0) and at 8, 15, 21, 30, 45, 60 and 90 days in order to monitor the baseline of immune functionality throughout the 90 days of the study. In summary, this proposal seeks to identify immunological markers of the immune system important for defense against SARS-CoV-2, that may be useful as prognostic markers for clinical response and treatment of patients with COVID-19, and also, to evaluates whether Hydroxychloroquine, used prophylactically, has a role in protecting against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a group of healthcare workers. If hydroxychloroquine, as we all hope, turns out to be an agent that prevent SARS-Cov-2 infection, a significant group of healthcare workers at HUN at risk of becoming ill during the epidemiological peak (expected May 1st), will be protected thanks to their participation in this study.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04346329","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

A draft paper was released recently in March by Didier Raoult from Aix-Marseille University in France on a preliminary trial of 36 COVID-19 patients. In this trial, 6 patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory symptoms, and 8 had lower respiratory symptoms. Between early and mid-March, they treated 20 of these patients with 600 mg of hydroxychloroquine daily in a hospital setting. Some patient also received the antibiotic azithromycin. 16 patients served as the controls. They observed a significant reduction in viral load in patients with hydroxychloroquine. After 6 days, 70% of the treated patients were considered cured (no virus detected in their samples) compared to 12.5% of controls. All 6 patients who received both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were negative for the virus after 6 days. This was an unblinded, non-randomized trial.\n\nVitamin C has multiple in-vivo effects on immune modulation that may, in sum, limit the development of the cytokine excess associated with critical illness.

Hydroxychloroquine is a known drug with low toxicity that may reduce progression of respiratory symptoms and resulting hospitalizations. This randomized control study will assess its potential as an off-label treatment in reducing the rates of hospitalization and subsequent mechanical ventilation from COVID-19 infection compared to standard of care treatment with Vitamin C. A randomized control trial with placebo is impractical due to the increasing availability of this medication to the public.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04334967","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Nitazoxanide (NTZx) is a derivative of 5-nitrothiazole, synthesized in 1974 by Rosignol - Cavier. NTZx has powerful antiviral effects through the phosphorylation of protein kinase activated by double-stranded RNA, which leads to an increase in phosphorylated factor 2-alpha, an intracellular protein with antiviral effects. The purpose of this study is to contrast the beneficial effect of NTZx vs NTZx plus hydroxychloroquine in patients Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) as well as against other treatments.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nIntroduction The current pandemic caused by the SARS-COV2 coronavirus (COVID-19) is life-threatening and is challenging the world's best health systems. Accelerated spread of this pandemia led physicians to try a variety of treatments without a well established sequence due to ignorance about this new disease. The case fatality rate has been calculated at 2.2% but there are differences depending on the country affected.\n\nPerspective When comparing the evolution of cases between Spain and Mexico, an apparently less pronounced trend is observed in Mexico, but this may be due to underdiagnosis. In calculations by the Mexican Ministry of Health, around 6% of the patients (approximately 10,500) who contract COVID-19 could be found serious and in need of hospitalization in intensive care.\n\nNTZx NTZx and its circulating active metabolite, tizoxanide, inhibit the replication of a wide range of viruses, both RNA and DNA. It has action against 16 strains of Influenza A virus subtypes H1N1, H3N2, H3N2v, H3N8, H5N9, H7N1 and a strain of influenza B. It also works against respiratory syncytial virus, norovirus, dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis virus, rotavirus , hepatitis B and C, even against the human immunodeficiency virus (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).\n\nProblem Mexico is in Phase 2 according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and more local infections due to coronaviruses are expected.

SARS-CoV-2 causes an acute and potentially lethal respiratory illness, known as COVID-19, that is threatening to overwhelm health care systems due to a dramatic surge in hospitalized and critically ill patients. Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 typically have been symptomatic for 5-7 days prior to admission, indicating that there is a window during which an effective intervention could significantly alter the course of illness, lessen disease spread, and alleviate the stress on hospital resources.\n\nThere is no known treatment for COVID-19, though in vitro and one poorly controlled study have identified a potential antiviral activity for HCQ. The rationale for this clinical trial is to measure the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine for reducing viral load and shedding in adult outpatients with confirmed COVID-19.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nBackground COVID-19 is pandemic with high mortality among hospitalized patients despite a benign course in the large majority of patients infected. Limited data are available from small outpatient studies and have not shown efficacy in preventing hospitalization. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine have antiviral and immune-modulating effects, but there are no data concerning their efficacy in reducing viral load and shedding in outpatients.\n\nEvidence supporting possible efficacy for hydroxychloroquine. In cell models, chloroquine both interferes with terminal glycosylation of the ACE2 receptor (the cell surface receptor by which SARS-CoV2 enters human cells) and increases endosomal pH, which interferes (at least in vitro) with a crucial step in viral replication.1,2 HCQ is 5x more potent than chloroquine in a Vero cell model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In independent experiments, chloroquine has confirmed in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, HCQ has in vitro efficacy against SARS-CoV-1. According to news releases, an as-yet-unpublished set of case series in China (N reportedly 120) suggests the possibility of rapid viral clearance and low rates of progression to critical illness. In addition to in vitro anti-viral effects chloroquine and HCQ appear to have immune-modulatory effects, especially via suppression of release of TNF and IL6, especially in macrophages.\n\nEvidence against efficacy for hydroxychloroquine. Chloroquine and HCQ have been promoted as extremely broad anti-infective agents for decades. The reported effects include suppression of fungi, atypical bacteria, and viruses. Other than the effects on ACE2 glycosylation, the mechanisms invoked as evidence for efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 have also been invoked for a wide range of viruses. However, when chloroquine and HCQ have been studied in humans, neither agent has demonstrated consistent efficacy in clinical trials, including in HIV, influenza, hepatitis, and Dengue. In one trial, chloroquine resulted in increased viral replication in Chikungunya virus [Roques et al, Viruses 2018 May 17;10(5)] while in another hydroxychloroquine was associated with increased HIV viral load [Paton et al, JAMA 2012 Jul 25;308(4):353]. Expert opinion advises against HCQ for MERS, another serious coronavirus. An underpowered (n=30) study of HCQ in COVID-19 recently published in China did not demonstrate any clinical benefit [Chen et al, J Zhejiang University, 2020 March 9]. The long history of clinical failure despite in vitro anti-viral activity suggests a low probability of efficacy.\n\nRationale for Trial There is significant publicity concerning the potential use of HCQ in this pandemic, and many patients are seeking access to this unproven therapy. The ANZICS guidelines emphasize that novel treatments should be administered within clinical trials; the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines (http://bit.ly/SSCCOVID-19) also affirm the lack of evidence to support the clinical use of (hydroxy)chloroquine. WHO guidance (https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331446/WHO-2019-nCoV-clinical-2020.4-eng.pdf) also strongly affirms that \"investigational anti-COVID-19 therapeutics should be done under ethically approved, randomized, controlled trials.\" The evidence thus strongly favors equipoise.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04342169","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

After quality control verification the final NK cell product will be resuspended in 300 mL saline solution for intravenous infusion. Initially, we will enroll in this study ten COVID-19 infected adult patients with moderate symptoms (NEWS 2 scale score>4). Consent forms will be signed by the patient before the therapy. Patients will be treated with three different infusions of NK cells 48 h apart with 1, 10, and 20 million cells/kg body weight. We will follow the patients for any adverse effect, clinical response and immune effects by flow cytometry including markers for NK cells expressing different markers (CD158b, NKG2A, and IFN-y). We anticipated that the release of IFN-y by exogenous NK cells could attract other immune cell populations to boost the immune response against COVID-19.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04344548","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

These patients will be selected by the use of a panel of biomarkers and laboratory findings and they will be allocated to immunotherapy treatment according to their needs.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nHumanity is experiencing since November 2019 a new pandemic by the novel SARS Coronavirus-19 (SARS-CoV-2). As of March 16 2020 170,191 documented case were reported worldwide of which 6,526 died1. The analysis of the clinical characteristics of these patients showed that among those who were critically ill with acute respiratory failure the risk of death was as high as 60%2. Main clinical feature is the presence of comorbidities and age more than 60 years whereas main laboratory findings are leukopenia and lymphopenia with hepatic dysfunction and increase of D-dimers3,4. It is also reported that these patients suffer from intense pro-inflammation where hyper-cytokinemia predominates5,6.\n\nThe above characteristics lead to consider two main mechanisms of pathogenesis of this critical condition: macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and immune dysregulation. Early and correct understanding of the mechanism and management are of prime importance. This can be achieved only through a therapeutic protocol where the early recognition of the immune state can be done with the use of biomarkers and with the delivery of the precise treatment aiming to the correction of the immune dysregulation.\n\nData of the Hellenic Sepsis Study Group indicate that MAS can be diagnosed with reliability using serum ferritin7. Concentrations greater than 4,420ng/ml possess diagnostic specificity 97.3% and negative predictive value 98%. According to these data, the risk of developing MAS is greater among patients with comorbidities like type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart failure who are prone to hyper-production of interleukin (IL)-1β by tissue macrophages8. A recent retrospective analysis of patients with severe sepsis and MAS showed that the administration of anakinra decreased 28-day mortality by 30%9. Anakinra is the recombinant antagonist of human IL-1β receptor. IL-1β over-production is the hallmark of the pathogenesis of MAS. Results of a phase III study in 906 patients showed that anakinra was a very safe drug: there was neither excess mortality nor increased susceptibility to secondary infections9. Since November 2017 the randomized clinical trial entitled \"A trial of validation and restoration of immune dysfunction in severe infections and sepsis, PROVIDE\" (EudraCT number: 2017-002171-26, approval 78/17 by the National Ethics Committee, approval IS 75/17 by the National Organization for Medicines, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03332225). In this study patients with sepsis and laboratory diagnosis of MAS are randomized to treatment with placebo or anakinra for seven days. Enrolment was completed in December 2019 and no drug related adverse events have been reported.\n\nRecent unpublished data of the Hellenic Sepsis Study Group demonstrate that patients with immune dysregulation have profound lymphopenia associated with elevated IL-6. This is in accordance with evidence of the H1N1 pandemic where patients with pneumonia had substantial lymphopenia and increased Τ regulatory lymphocytes (Treg). This increase of Τreg was prominent among patients with comorbidities like diabetes mellitus, chronic heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease10,11. The IL-6 blocker tocilizumab is a promising candidate for the reversal of this immune dysregulation.\n\nESCAPE is an address to the personalized management of life-threatening organ dysfunction by SARS-CoV-2. More precisely, patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 associated with MAS and immune dysregulation will be administered treatment with anakinra and tocilizumab respectively.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04339712","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

WHO data reported admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) for 6% of patients, with a mortality rate reaching 45%. To date, apart from therapeutic trials, ICU management is symptomatic, based on organ failure support therapies. In the initial phase, the therapeutic management also includes empiric antimicrobial therapy (90% of patients, in accordance with LRTI guidelines (ATS 2019) and SRLF Guidelines (2020). One challenge for the ICU physicians is the timing for discontinuation of antimicrobial treatment, especially in case of shock or ARDS, considering that a substantial proportion of COVID-19 pneumonia patients may have pulmonary bacterial coinfection/superinfection. In order to avoid unnecessary prolonged antimicrobial therapy, and subsequent selective pressure, two tests could be combined in a personalized antibiotic strategy:\n\nProcalcitonin (PCT): PCT is a useful tool to guide antibiotics discontinuation in community-acquired pneumonia) and viral pneumonia (PMID24612487).\nRespiratory multiplex PCR FA-PPP (Biomérieux®): panel has been enlarged, including 8 viruses and 18 bacteria (quantitative analysis).

Conventional microbiological investigations are left at the discretion of the physicians, and may include blood cultures, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila urinary antigen assays, and a respiratory tract sample for Gram stain examination and 2 days-long culture (if not already done in the past 24 hours). Usual biology includes procalcitonin measurement.

A large epidemic would seriously challenge the available hospital capacity, and this would be augmented by infection of healthcare workers (HCW). Strategies to prevent infection and disease severity of HCW are, therefore, desperately needed to safeguard continuous patient care. Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is a vaccine against tuberculosis, with protective non-specific effects against other respiratory tract infections in in vitro and in vivo studies, and reported morbidity and mortality reductions as high as 70%. Furthermore, in our preliminary analysis, areas with existing BCG vaccination programs appear to have lower incidence and mortality from COVID191. The investigators hypothesize that BCG vaccination can reduce HCW infection and disease severity during the epidemic phase of SARS-CoV-2.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nRecruitment, Randomization, treatment allocation, and blinding\n\nA standardized, IRB approved email will be sent to department chairs describing the study. A research coordinator will reach out to interested participants via phone with the help of an IRB-approved verbal script to introduce the study, confirm eligibility and provide further instructions on how to access and sign the IRB-approved ICD via REDCap using their own electronic devices. It is important that the investigators obtain the consent via REDCAp to a) avoid direct person-to-person contact and comply with social distancing imposed recommendations, and b) minimize the waste of reconstituted BCG by allowing the research personnel to schedule vaccinations in a controlled fashion. Patient registration into the trial will happen immediately after consent has been provided and will involve entering of baseline information into an electronic data capture system (RedCap).\n\nOnce the eligibility is confirmed and the ICD signed by the participant and stored in REDCap, the research coordinator will randomize the participant and communicate the treatment assignment to the nurse administering the vaccination. The nurse will subsequently assign an appointment and communicate date and time of vaccination with the participant. All eligible participants will receive intradermal injections of BCG:placebo in a 1:1 ratio.\n\nBoth, participants and investigators will be blinded to the treatment assignments during the study. However, in case of an emergency where it is important to know the treatment received, the investigator and/or participant can reach out to the unblinded study personnel who will provide the unblinded data. All participants will receive their treatment allocation at the end of the study, after the data analysis is finalized.\n\nUnblinded personnel will not be involved in the collection and analysis of study data other than the baseline eligibility criteria.\n\nThe end of the study is defined as the last patient's last entry in the electronic data capture system.\n\nInformed Consent and Eligibility\n\nThe following types of procedures will be conducted as indicated below:\n\nMedical history will be obtained from patient medical record/clinical chart. Informed Consent will be obtained to access these records.

As of now, the number of coronavirus deaths increased to 108,281 worldwide. Total number of cases approached 1,800,000 according to the latest information. While the number of healed patients was highest in China, 77,525 people with COVID-19 recovered.\nCOVID-19 is a highly contagious respiratory infectious disease that can cause respiratory, physical and psychological dysfunction in patients. Respiratory rehabilitation reduces the patient's symptoms of dyspnea, relieves anxiety and depression, reduces the patient's need to apply to the hospital, increases functional capacity and improves the patient's quality of life. Respiratory rehabilitation, according to the feedback from China, is very important for patients in the clinical treatment and recovery process after treatment. Rehabilitation of people with mild disease after discharge is mainly based on improving physical fitness and psychological adaptation. It is also aimed to gradually restore the individual's ability to the activity before the disease and return to the community as soon as possible. Individuals with COVID-19 who have respiratory and / or limb dysfunction and chronic disease after discharge should receive respiratory rehabilitation therapy. According to the current findings of the patients discharged from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the clinical experience of patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) patients who recovered after discharge, COVID-19 patients may have physical fitness, dyspnea after activity, and muscle atrophy.

Our hypothesis is that, in comparison to the placebo, pyridostigmine will reduce in at least 10% a composite outcome [death; mechanical ventilation; >2 point-increase in the SOFA score) by day 28. We will also evaluate interleukin (IL)-6 kinetics during the first 14 days of in-hospital stay.\nIt is estimated that 25-33% of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 are admitted to intensive care units (ICU) for severe hypoxemia. The reported mortality in those with severe disease ranges between 38% and 49%. So far, there is no pharmacological therapeutic (or else) strategy known to reduce morbidity and mortality in these patients. Mortality in COVID-19 appears to be mediated not necessarily by the direct effect of the infection, but by the disproportionate inflammatory response of the host.\nPyridostigmine is an old drug that, by inhibiting acetylcholine-esterase, the enzymatic machinery that degrades acetylcholine (ACh), results in increased ACh bioavailability. ACh, in turn, ligates to nicotinic-alpha7 receptors in macrophages and T cells, resulting in reduced overactivation of these immune cells. In experimental murine sepsis, this family of drugs has resulted in reduced inflammation and mortality. Human evidence is scarce for severe inflammatory conditions. However, recent evidence from our group and others indicates that pyridostigmine has an immunomodulatory effect in people living with HIV, resulting in elevation of CD4+ T cell counts, decreased immune activation, and reduction in inflammatory mediators. Altogether, this suggests that ACh-esterase inhibitors may act as immunomodulators during viral infections, potentially reducing the inflammatory cascade (the so-called \"cytokine storm\") observed in critically ill COVID-19 patients.\nAt the proposed dose (60mg/d), the rate of minor adverse events is less than 5% with no reported serious adverse effects. From that perspective, we consider that pyridostigmine can function as an immuno-modulator and reduce morbidity and mortality in COVID-19-stricken patients, with the added value of a safe pharmacological profile. Moreover, as an old drug, re-purposing it for a novel indication may be a simpler, more efficient approach than developing a novel one from the ground up.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04343963","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

It is of paramount importance to preserve health service capacity by identifying those with serious illness without transferring all infected patients to emergency rooms or Hospitals. In addition, it is important to identify seriously ill patients early enough and before they reach a point of deterioration where they can be extremely challenging to handle in both prehospital and hospital environment.\nThe present study is designed to sample biosensor data from patients treated and observed at home due to mild and moderate SARS-Cov-2 disease.

The renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) plays an important role in the development of ARDS.\n\nACE2 is one of the enzymes involved in the RAS cascade. Virus spike protein binds to ACE2 to form a complex suitable for cellular internalization. The downregulation of ACE2 results in the excessive accumulation of angiotensin II, and it has been demonstrated that the stimulation of the angiotensin II type 1a receptor (AT1R) increases pulmonary vascular permeability, explaining the increased lung pathology when activity of ACE2 is decreased. Currently available AT1R blockers (ARBs) such as valsartan, have the potential to block this pathological process mediated by angiotensin II. There are presently two complementary mechanisms suggested: 1) ARBs block the excessive angiotensin-mediated AT1R activation, and 2) they upregulate ACE2, which reduces angiotensin II concentrations and increases the production of the protective vasodilator angiotensin 1-7.

PP involves placing patients in the prone, i.e. face down position for time periods of up to 16 hours per day. PP promotes lung homogeneity, improves gas exchange and respiratory mechanics permitting reduction of ventilation intensity, and reducing ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).\n\nMaintaining self-ventilation is associated with increased aeration of dependent lung regions, less need for sedation, improved cardiac filling and removes the risk of VILI, and so is an important therapeutic goal in hypoxic patients.

It is under development for the treatment of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) resulting from infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2), where there is significant unmet medical need.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nCalpains are a class of non-lysosomal cysteine proteases involved in diverse cellular processes. Several independent publications indicate that specific host cellular proteases called dimeric calpains are essential for the replication of multiple RNA viruses including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-1. In 2004, Barnard and colleagues described that the inhibition of calpains 1 and 2 by distinct calpain inhibitors, MDL 28170 and SJA 6017, resulted in anti-SARS-CoV activity by reducing infectious virus particle replication and hence production (Barnard, 2004). This observation was reproduced with MDL 28170, which showed a >7-log reduction in SARS-CoV replication in cell culture systems (Schneider, 2012). The anti-viral activity of the compound was confirmed to be due to inhibition of m calpain by utilizing a small interfering RNA (siRNA) approach to selectively silence expression of this dimeric calpain isoform. This confirmed the specific requirement for dimeric m calpain activity during SARS-CoV replication in vitro (Schneider, 2012). MDL 28170 is a nonclinical tool calpain inhibitor compound with known off-target liabilities that has not been evaluated in nonclinical or clinical safety studies.\n\nIt has been shown that the receptor for SARS-CoV-1 and -2 entry into the cell is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) (Kuba, 2010). ACE-2 and the dimeric calpains (data on file) are co-expressed in respiratory epithelial cells, the site of both viral entry and predominant early lung injury in COVID-19.\n\nIn addition to the potential for anti-viral activity by calpain inhibition, nonclinical animal bleomycin lung injury models demonstrated that BLD-2660 normalized tissue IL-6 levels, a proinflammatory cytokine demonstrated to be elevated in COVID-19 patients and is implicated in disease pathogenesis. This pro-inflammatory cytokine has been shown to contribute to lung damage during SARS-CoV infection and the virus itself is capable of directly inducing its expression (Bozym, 2011; Yoon, 2008). Thus BLD-2660 could potentially reduce both viral replication and the nonproductive host-response to infection, both contributors to morbidity and mortality in COVID-19.\n\nBLD2660, has shown greater selectivity for calpain inhibition than MDL 28170, the prototypic calpain inhibitor utilized to effectively inhibit SARS-CoV replication. BLD-2660 lacks cross-reactivity with other cysteine proteases such as cathepsins. The safety and tolerability of BLD-2660 has been demonstrated in the recently completed Phase 1 single ascending dose (SAD)/multiple ascending dose (MAD) B-2660-101 study.\n\nThis study will evaluate BLD-2660 as an add-on therapy to standard of care (SOC) in hospitalized subjects with recent diagnosis of COVID-19.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04334460","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Patients with certain risk factors seem to die by an overwhelming reaction of the immune system to the virus, causing a cytokine storm with features of Cytokine-Release Syndrome (CRS) and Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) and resulting in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Several pro-inflammatory cytokines are elevated in the plasma of patients and features of MAS in COVID-19, include elevated levels of ferritin, d-dimer, and low platelets.\n\nThere is increasing data that cytokine-targeted biological therapies can improve outcomes in CRS or MAS and even in sepsis. Tocilizumab (TCZ), an anti-IL-6R biological therapy, has been approved for the treatment of CRS and is used in patients with MAS. Based on these data, it is hypothesized that TCZ can reduce mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 prone to CRS and ARDS.\n\nThe overall purpose of this study is to evaluate whether treatment with TCZ reduces the severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nBackground and Rationale\n\nThe Acute Respiratory Syndrome by Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan/China, is causing a worldwide pandemic with potentially lethal implications on an individual basis, and, on the large scale bringing the health care systems and the economy to its limits. The mortality rate of this COronaVIrus induced Disease, COVID-19, has been estimated by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be 3.7%, which is more than 10-fold higher than the mortality of influenza.\n\nAn infection with SARS-CoV-2 may cause an excessive host immune response, leading to an Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and death. Reports from China and from Italy describe an overwhelming inflammation which is triggered by the virus, causing a cytokine storm with features of Cytokine-Release Syndrome (CRS) and/or Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS). Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as Interleukin-6 (IL-6) are elevated in the plasma of patients and features of MAS in COVID-19 include elevated levels of ferritin, d-dimer and low platelets.\n\nThere is increasing evidence, that cytokine-targeted biological therapies can improve outcomes in CRS or MAS and even in sepsis. In recognition of the dramatic development of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in a pragmatic manner, already approved and safe therapies should be evaluated for the use in severe COVID-19.\n\nTocilizumab (TCZ), an anti-IL-6R biological therapy, has been approved for the treatment of CRS and is used in patients with MAS (and in other rheumatologic conditions like Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) or Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA), with a good safety profile also in the elderly).\n\nCollectively, the data strongly suggest that neutralization of the inflammatory pathway induced by IL-6 may reduce mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 prone to CRS and ARDS.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04335071","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

In a clinical case published in the Chinese journal of hyperbaric medicine, treatment with repeated HBO sessions prevented admission to intensive care unit with mechanical ventilation in a patient aged 69 who presented with signs of respiratory decompensation. HBOT is the most powerful oxygenation modality in the body today. HBOT can dramatically increase the amount of dissolved oxygen in the blood. HBOT not only promotes blood transport but also its tissue delivery. Furthermore, HBOT has specific immunomodulatory properties, both humoral and cellular, making it possible, for example, to reduce the intensity of the inflammatory response and to stimulate antioxidant defenses by repeating sessions. A virucidal capacity of HBOT might also be involved. HBOT is generally regarded as safe with very few adverse events.\nFollowing this feedback, it is proposed in the context of crisis management related to SARS-CoV2 to assess the value of HBO treatment of patients with CoV2 pneumonia. Indeed, it seems essential to propose therapeutic strategies to limit the risk of respiratory decompensation requiring admission to intensive care unit for patients with SARS-CoV2 pneumonia.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04344431","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

Thus, sample size calculations in the proposed trial are based on the investigators' best estimates for several parameters.\nIn accordance to the effect of oseltamivir against symptomatic influenza, we assumed an approximate effectiveness of approximately 60% (HR of 0.4) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6464969/) as realistic. As a prophylactic intervention with HCQ, which may have side effects and for which supply shortage can be expected, was judged justifiable only if its effectiveness is high, we based our sample size consideration on a HR of 0.3. To estimate the probability of an event in both the experimental and the control group, very little data is available. In a Dutch point-prevalence study 0-10% of health-care workers were infected depending on the healthcare institution, depending on the hospital. This point-prevalence study was performed between 6 and 9 March, when the reported number of cases in the Netherlands was 33 and 77, respectively, according to the RIVM (https://www.rivm.nl/nieuws/resultaat-steekproef-4-ziekenhuismedewerkers-heeft-coronavirus). Additionally, in an a report published in the Lancet, 20% of responding healthcare workers in Italy were found to be infected with SARS-CoV2 within less than one month (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30627-9/fulltext). Several media reports indicate that this proportion is similar across various healthcare institutions and countries (https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/world/europe/coronavirus-europe-covid-19.html) and (https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/spain-tightens-restrictions-week-lockdown-begins-200330191539568.html).\nAs the proposed study will be performed in a high-risk setting, we assumed an event (i.e. PCR positivity) probability of 10% in the control group and 3% in the experimental arm after the maximum study period. In summary, a sample size of 210 participants per arm is necessary to detect a HR of 0.3 with a power of 80.3% with an alpha-error of 0.05. To account for drop-outs and asymptomatic, undetected infection at inclusion or past infection with existing immunity, an additional 10 participants will randomized per treatment arm. The overall study population is therefore 440 participants.\nStatistical analysis will be based on two populations: A Modified Intention to Treat population excluding those who withdrew consent after randomization and those with a positive serology at baseline. And a per protocol population including all randomized subjects who completed at least 3 out of 4 follow-up visits and took at least 80% of all doses of study medication.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04336748","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

This pandemic is responsible of significant mortality. In France, several thousand patients are hospitalized in intensive care units, and their number continues to increase. Mortality during Covid-19 is mainly linked to acute respiratory distress syndrome, which frequency is estimated in France to occur in 6% of infected patients. Comorbidities such as cardiovascular conditions, obesity and diabetes increase susceptibility to severe forms of Covid-19 and associated mortality. Therapeutic management has three components: symptomatic management, including supplementary oxygen therapy and in case of respiratory distress mechanical ventilation; the antiviral approach; and immunomodulation, aiming at reducing inflammation associated with viral infection, which is considered to take part in severe presentations of the disease.\nDuring Covid-19 viral pneumonia related to SARS-COv-2, there is a significant release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the acute phase of viral infection, which could participate in viral pneumonia lesions. In children with less mature immune system than adults, SARS-Cov-2 infection is less severe. The current prevailing assumption is that severe forms of Covid-19 may not only be related to high viral replication, but also to an excessive inflammatory response favoring acute lung injury and stimulating infection.\nThe investigators hypothesize that early control of the excessive inflammatory response may help reducing the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome.\nThe investigators will evaluate the benefit, safety and tolerability of corticosteroid therapy to reduce the rate of subjects hospitalized for Covid-19 viral pneumonia who experience clinical worsening with a need of high-flow supplemental oxygen supplementation or transfer in intensive care units for respiratory support.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04344288","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

Moreover, several studies showed a shorter hospital stay and lower mortality in patients treated with convalescent plasma than those who were not treated with convalescent plasma. Evidence shows that convalescent plasma from patients who have recovered from viral infections can be used effectively as a treatment of patients with active disease.\n\nThe use of solutions enriched of antiviral antibodies has several important advantages over the convalescent plasma including the high level of neutralizing antibodies supplied. Plasma-exchange is expensive and requires large volumes of substitution fluid. Albumin is better tolerated and less expensive, but exchanges using albumin solutions increase the risk of bleeding because of progressive coagulation factor depletion. With either albumin or fresh frozen plasma, increasing the risk of cardiovascular instability in the plasma donor and in the recipient, which can be detrimental in a critically ill patient with COVID 19 pneumonia.\n\nThe aforementioned limitations of plasma therapy can be overcome by using selective apheresis methods, such as double-filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP).DFPP is a modality of plasma purification that performs an initial plasma separation from blood, and the subsequent separation of specific molecules, on the basis of their specific molecular weight (cut-off), by using a fractionation filter. The Fractionation Filter 2A20, because of its membrane sieving cut-off, retains larger molecules and returns plasma along with smaller molecules to the circulation, including the major part of the albumin. The selection of the membrane 2A20 is related to the appropriate Sieving Coefficient for IgG that allows to efficiently collect antibodies from patients which are recovered from COVID-19, with negligible fluid losses and limited removal of albumin. The total amount of antibodies obtained during one DFPP session exceeds by three to four times the total amount provided to recipients with one unit of plasma obtained during one plasma-exchange session from one COVID-19 convalescent donor. This should result in more effective viral inhibition and larger benefit for the patient achieved with one unit of enriched immunoglobulin solution obtained with DFPP than with one unit of plasma obtained with plasma exchange.\n\nThese observations provide the background for a pilot study aimed to explore whether the infusion of antibodies obtained with one single DFPP procedure from voluntary convalescent donors could offer an effective and safe therapeutic option for critically ill patients with severe coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04346589","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

There is a more than 50 years track record of safety of HCQ for treatment and prevention of various disease states. Early data on use of HCQ for COVID treatment suggests anti-viral activity and immunomodulatory properties for reducing inflammation associated with COVID-19. Given the lack of data regarding use of HCQ for COVID-19 prevention in healthy participants in midst of pandemic crisis, this study proposes an expedited feasibility study focusing on safety and early efficacy.\nPrior to HCQ administration, baseline SARS-CoV-2 and other baseline biomarker testing will be conducted. During the 4-week study period, participants will be monitored for drug related adverse events and assessed for development of COVID. SARS-CoV-2 assay and biomarker testing will be repeated at the end of four-week study.

The software PASS15 was used for calculations.\n\nThe study will also include a parallel retrospective group of temporally concomitant patients from IRCCS, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, who did not receive an experimental treatment and who are enrolled in an already IRB approved observational study\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nAs of March 12, 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been confirmed in 125 048 people worldwide, carrying a mortality of approximately 3·7%, 1 compared with a mortality rate of less than 1% from influenza. There is an urgent need for effective treatment. The 2019 novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)) has spread rapidly since its recent identification in patients with severe pneumonia in Wuhan, China. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 varies from asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic forms to clinical conditions characterized by respiratory failure that necessitates mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit (ICU), to multiorgan and systemic manifestations in terms of sepsis, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes (MODS). Current management of COVID-19 is supportive, and respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the leading cause of mortality.\n\nThe cytokine profile of COVID-19 patients supports that the fatality is driven by a virally-triggered, self-propagating, hyper-inflammatory state (Mehta et al, 2020). Elevated ferritin (mean 1297·6 ng/ml in non-survivors vs 614·0 ng/ml in survivors; p<0·001) and IL-6 (p<0·0001) have been found to be independent predictors of fatality in COVID-19 patients in China (Ruan et al, 2020).\n\nVOD, known as Veno-Occlusive-Disease or Synusoidal Obstruction Syndrome, is the most characterized of a spectrum of post bone marrow transplantation (BMT) syndromes (including ELS, IPS or aGVHD) characterized by reactive endothelial activation and damage, endothelial-driven paracrine signaling and a pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulant state. Severe VOD frequently progresses to Multi Organ Failure and is characterized by high mortality (>80%), characterized mostly by lung and kidney failure.\n\nHigh levels (elevated early in the course of the disease) of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha characterize VOD and the other post-BMT endothelial diseases (Schots et al, 2003, Gugliotta et al 1994, Remberger et al 1997, Symington et al, 1992). In detail, IL-8 may be involved in the respiratory failure following ARDS, a frequent and fatal outcome of sVOD patients. Intriguingly, high ferritin levels are a well recognized risk factor for the development of VOD in both adult and pediatric settings.\n\nFurthermore, the histopathological examination of lung lesions in VOD syndromes show early alveolar epithelial and lung endothelial injury, resulting in accumulation of protein- and fibrin-rich inflammatory edematous fluid in the alveolar space and progression to interstitial fibrosis, at later stages.\n\nThese patterns are reminiscent of what observed in the only three cases of autoptic examination of lung tissue so far obtained from COVID-19 infected individuals: two from putatively early phase and one from a late phase of the disease: such as, early diffuse alveolar damage with proteinaceous exudates, and chronical inflammation with intra alveolar deposition of fibrin and interstitial fibrosis, respectively.\n\nThus, we suggest here that the pattern of circulating cytokines, similar histopathological findings in infected patients and hyper-ferritinemia represent some hallmarks common to both COVID-19 induced pathology and VOD/SOS (and other endothelial damage syndromes), possibly underlying common mechanisms of progression.\n\nDefibrotide, a polydisperse mixture of predominantly single-stranded polydeoxyribonucleotides, is currently the only therapy approved to treat hepatic VOD/SOS with pulmonary/renal dysfunction (ie, multiorgan dysfunction/multiorgan failure [MOD/MOF]) following HSCT in the United States and to treat severe hepatic VOD/SOS post-HSCT in the European Union. In preclinical and human studies, defibrotide has demonstrated profibrinolytic, antithrombotic, anti-inflammatory, and angio-protective actions, thus promoting an anticoagulant phenotype of the endothelium that protects and stabilizes the function of endothelial cells. In a phase 3, historically controlled, multicenter trial in adults and children with VOD/SOS and MOD/MOF (defibrotide: n = 102; controls treated before defibrotide availability: n = 32), defibrotide resulted in significantly greater day +100 survival following HSCT (38.2%) vs controls (25.0%; propensity analysis-estimated between-group difference: 23%; P = .0109). Importantly, a posthoc analysis of a conspicuous number of defibrotide-treated patients (n=651) has recently shown that defibrotide treatment also to critically ill patients, such as those with ventilator dependence at study entry, could highly benefit from defibrotide treatment.\n\nDefibrotide has, overall, demonstrated endothelial-protective properties, with pro-fibrinolytic, anti-thrombotic, anti-ischemic, anti-inflammatory, and antiadhesive activities, but no significant systemic anticoagulant effects. Defibrotide appears to exert several anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects through interaction with the EC membrane, as shown in an endothelial cell line of hepatic origin.\n\nAt least part of defibrotide's lifesaving activity is due to downregulation of circulating cytokines, chiefly IL-6 and TNF-alpha and by reducing PAI-1 levels, NFKB activation and expression of MHCI and MHCII molecules. As compared to other agents, targeting a specific cytokines or a specific factor, defibrotide's pleiotropic mechanism of action may underlie its effectiveness in both early and late progressed states of MOF and in prophylactic settings as well.\n\nPatients with clinical and radiological evidence consistent with idiopathic pneumonia syndrome, all showed underlying disease processes which can be interpreted as associated with endothelial cell activation injury. Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome is a rare complication following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), defined by diffuse lung injury with no identified etiology, with an incidence of 2-12%.; it shows histological evidence of type II endothelial cell activation, with display of ICAM-1 and/or VCAM-1, and endothelial injury, with endothelial upregulation of eNOS. This, together with histological findings of intra-alveolar fibrin and pulmonary hypertension suggests that endothelial cell activation injury may be a causative factor underlying idiopathic pneumonia syndrome Defibrotide may prove to be useful in the treatment of patients with idiopathic pneumonia syndrome, although stratifying which patients will benefit from this treatment requires further study.\n\nA potential beneficial effect from defibrotide in treating pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) has been suggested. Its action is probably due to the drug's ability to selectively increase prostaglandin I2 and E2 levels and to increase tissue plasminogen activator and decrease plasminogen activator inhibitor function.\n\nThe use of defibrotide does not change the pathway of care, therefore the only changes to the budget are drug acquisition costs and cost avoidance as a result of reduced ICU/HDU use. Defibrotide reduces the length of stay avoiding extended use of ICU or HDU beds (NHS England Clinical Commissioning Policy.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04335201","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

We hypothesize that high concentration inhaled NO can have a viricidal effect against SARS-Cov-2 and prevent the deterioration to a severe form of COVID-19 when administered at an early stage of the disease. Additional potential mechanisms why INO may be effective in this indication: 1)improves V/Q ratio, 2) reduces PVR and PAP, 3) Anti-thrombotic in lung. This would have potential benefit for the patients in terms of reducing the severity of the clinical course and time to recovery. An additional benefit could be for the society since a faster and a less severe clinical course could protect limited hospital resources (ED, floor, and ICU) from being overwhelmed.\n\nThe primary aim is to prevent the deterioration of mild COVID-19 infection (defined by a RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 in a specimen from any site) with respiratory signs/ symptoms to a more severe form of the disease as defined by the patient needing to 1) return to the ED, 2) be admitting to the hospital, 3) be intubated, 4) and all cause 28 day mortality.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04338828","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

When used properly, these irrigations are a safe and easy intervention available over the counter without a prescription. Additionally, baby shampoo has been found to be a safe additive functioning as a surfactant when a small amount is added to the saline rinses which may help augment clearance of the sinonasal cavity.\nWhile many systemic medications and treatments have been proposed for COVID-19, there has not yet been a study looking at targeted local intervention to the nasal cavity and nasopharynx where the viral load is the highest. Studies have shown that the use of simple over the counter nasal saline irrigations can decrease viral shedding in the setting of viral URIs, including the common coronavirus (not SARS-CoV-2). Further, as SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus, mild-detergent application with nasal saline would neutralize the virus further. It is our hypothesis that nasal saline or nasal saline with baby shampoo irrigations may decrease viral shedding/viral load and viral transmission, secondary bacterial load, nasopharyngeal inflammation in patients infected with the novel SARS-CoV-2.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04347538","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

It is hypothesized that TXA will reduce the infectivity and virulence of the virus.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nA recent report in Physiological Reviews proposed that the endogenous protease plasmin acts on the COVID19 virus by cleaving a newly inserted furin site in the S protein portion of the virus resulting in increased infectivity and virulence. Patients with hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular illness, lung disease and kidney dysfunction commonly have elevated levels of plasmin/plasminogen and it was proposed that this may be the mechanism for poorer outcomes in patients with these co-morbidities. A logical treatment that might blunt this process would be the inhibition of the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. There is an inexpensive, commonly used drug, tranexamic acid, (TXA), which suppresses this conversion and could be re-purposed for the treatment of COVID19.\n\nTXA is a synthetic analog of the amino acid lysine which reversibly binds four to five lysine receptor sites on plasminogen. This reduces conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, and is normally used to prevent fibrin degradation. TXA is FDA approved for treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding (typical dose 1300 mg p.o. three times per day x 5 days) and off-label use for many other indications. TXA is used perioperatively as a standard-of-care at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) for orthopedic and cardiac bypass surgeries. At our institution, it is commonly employed in hemorrhaging trauma patients and currently is being studied for perioperative use in Cesarean section surgeries. It has also been utilized for spinal surgery, neurosurgery, orthognathic surgeries and even long term for the treatment of cosmetic dermatological disorders with a long track record of safety. Given the potential benefit and limited toxicity of TXA it would appear warranted to perform a rapid randomized, double-blind placebo controlled exploratory trial at UAB in the treatment of the early phases of COVID19 to determine whether it reduces infectivity and virulence of the COVID19 virus as hypothesized. Involvement of each patient is only for 7 days before primary endpoints.\n\nAn exploratory, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 2 clinical trial in which study patients have just been diagnosed with COVID19 as an outpatient. The overall goal of this exploratory study is to assess both safety and efficacy of 5 days of TXA versus placebo in the COVID19 population. All patients would also receive daily Lovenox. The primary endpoint for the study would be a need for hospitalization. Contact would consist of daily phone contact.

However, the use of facial masks outside the health care system is not recommended by the Danish Health Authorities. Here, Health Authorities in other countries have different recommendations for the use of facial masks.\nChallenges when using facial masks outside the health care system include wearing the mask consistently, an efficacy of the mask of app. 8 hours necessitating a change of mask throughout the day, and that it is not sufficiently tight enough to safely keep the virus out. Moreover, the eyes (mucous membrane) remain exposed. Compliance could also be another challenge.\nSARS-COV2 is assumed to primarily enter the body via the mouth through respiratory droplets - or possibly through inhalation of aerosol containing the virus. From the mouth the virus is assumed to spread to the airways and the gastro-intestinal tract. SARS-COV2 is also known to be transmitted via physical contact, helped along by the fact that the virus can survive on surfaces for at least 72 hours. Touching such a contaminated surface can transfer the virus to the mouth via the hand - and thus lead to infection of the person.\nFacial masks are expected to protect against viral infection in two ways;\n1. By reducing the risk of getting the virus in via the mouth or nose via respiratory droplets or aerosol\n2. By reducing the transfer from virus-contaminated hands to the mouth or nose\nHypothesis The use of surgical facial masks outside the hospital will reduce the frequency of COVID-19 infection.\nAll participants will follow authority recommendations and be randomized to either wear facial masks or not. The participants will be screened for antibodies at study start and study end. They will perform swab-test if they experience symptoms during the study as well as the end of study.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04337541","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

Currently, with nearly 1.3 million confirmed cases, there is still no effective way to contain the disease. The transmission of COVID-19 occurs via direct (prolonged close interaction, within 2 meters for more than 30 minutes) and indirect (fomites) contacts. Locally, the risk of COVID-19 infection in household contacts of confirmed cases is about 4%. These at-risk individuals are identified through contact tracing and infectious may be preventable using post-exposure-prophylaxis (PEP). However, there has yet to be a single effective, safe, and affordable pharmacological agent with such capabilities. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a cheap anti-malarial and immunomodulatory agent which may potentially be used as PEP against COVID-19. HCQ is capable of blocking the invasion and intracellular replication of the virus. Existing studies have reported efficacy of HCQ in treating COVID-19, with reduced time to clinical recovery and few reports of patients suffering from significant side effects. However, existing studies are largely limited by their small sample sizes. Furthermore, there has yet to be a published trial on HCQ's role in PEP. This cluster randomized trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral HCQ PEP, taken over for 5 days, in reducing the number of infected household contacts of confirmed COVID-19 patients under home quarantine. Comparison will be made between HCQ PEP (treatment group) and no treatment (control group). Subjects will be followed up over a course of 28 days, with daily symptom monitoring conducted over phone calls. Positive outcomes from this study will provide a means for us to battle the COVID-19 pandemic.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04342156","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

The pandemic known as COVID-19 is now spreading across the world with currently (April 10, 2020) more than 1 115 530 active cases and 96 791 deaths. In most affected countries the current goal is to 'flatten the curve' of the epidemic since there is no health care system that is able to treat an extremely high volume of patients all at once. There is a need for immediately applicable treatments for the patients at highest risk, which gains time until targeted therapies become available. A key feature in the pathomechanism of the disease is that the virus elicits an immunological over-reaction in the human body termed 'cytokine storm'. In susceptible patients this hyper-inflammation itself is a significant burden and may even inhibit the body to generate antibodies against the virus in adequate quantities. Therefore, identifying the subset of patients with excess cytokine response and supplementing them with convalescent plasma from recovered donors may be a life-saving treatment option.\nWhat is our study about? In light of recent promising data on plasma therapy in the treatment of COVID-19 and other viral epidemics, there is a need for better understanding the cytokine response to the virus in order to better characterize the target population for convalescent plasma therapy.\nOur hypothesis is that convalescent plasma transfusion from healthy donors who recovered from SARS CoV-2 is able to reduce the cytokine storm in addition to replenish the patient's own antibodies in the acutely infected phase of the disease.\nA plasmapheresis donation of 400ml will be performed in subjects who recovered from COVID-19 and who are otherwise eligible for plasma donation. The sample will be tested for anti-SARS CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers and those that reach the level of 1:320 will be processed for transfusion at the Hungarian National Transfusion Service.\nRecipients will be COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization regardless of the severity of the disease or other co-morbidities.

Development of a vaccine by pharmaceutical companies like Roche and antibody concentrates from convalescent patients' plasma by Takeda will take 10-12 months to complete, and we speculate that it will be overwhelmingly expensive and limited in supply. We are presenting this urgent proposal to use the convalescent plasma to save the lives of severely affected COVID-19 patients. Most of the logistic support is already available in MOH Saudi Arabia, and it will be a cheap and quick technique based on the time-tested principles of passive immunization which is supported by the most recent data from China. We are proposing to test the therapeutic potential of convalescent plasma (from patients who have fully recovered from COVID-19) in treating patients with serious COVID-19 disease or those who are at risk of developing a serious disease based on their comorbidities profile. Convalescent plasma could provide our first-line defense for people with Covid-19, especially those who are older and at a much higher risk for complications. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, with no available vaccine or proven antiviral drug, antibodies from recovering patients could provide a \"stopgap\" measure to help in controlling the pandemic effects on health and economy.\n\nWe plan to recruit at least 40 consenting donors and patients. Non-consenting patients will serve as controls.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nCoronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of RNA viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).1,2 The new strain of coronavirus identified in December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei province of China, was called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019- nCoV) and has been named by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The ICTV have determined that SARS-CoV-2 is the same species as SARS-CoV but a different strain. The World Health Organization (WHO) has named the disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections as \"COVID-19\".\n\nClinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infection typically include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), kidney failure and even death. It is not easy to differentiate between non-SARS-CoV-2 seasonal influenza and other respiratory viruses including the locally reported MERS-CoV and H1N1 influenza viruses. SARS-CoV-2 has a higher transmission rate (TR) with an approximate fatality rate of 3%. Although most of the younger patients recover after milder disease, but COVID-19 is most aggressive in the elderly population with worst pneumonia and death rates may reach 14.8%.4 Final diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on viral detection (and if possible, exclusion of other viruses e.g. by Respiratory Viral Panel). Laboratory detection of the SARS-CoV2 is based on detection of viral RNA by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) with confirmation by nucleic acid sequencing when necessary.1-5 For example, GeneFinder™ COVID-19 Plus RealAmp Kit is the One-Step Reverse Transcription Real-Time PCR Kit designed to detect the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) qualitatively through Reverse Transcription reaction and Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction. We will use this or equivalent method to confirm the diagnosis and will repeat the rRT-PCR to make sure it has become negative in a recovered patient. As of now, no vaccine or antiviral drug coming soon, antibodies from recovering patients could provide a \"stop-gap\" measure to help in controlling the pandemic. The concept of using convalescent plasma is not new. It has been tried in limited numbers of patients during more-recent viral crises, including the 2003 SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic, the 2009 \"swine flu\" epidemic, and the 2012 outbreak of MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome).6 Convalescent plasma treatment reduced mortality in patients with severe pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Virus Infection.7 Patients with a resolved viral infection will develop a polyclonal antibody immune response to different viral antigens of 2019-nCoV. Some of these polyclonal antibodies will likely neutralize the virus and prevent new rounds of infection, and the patients with resolved infection should produce 2019-nCoV antibodies in high titer. Patients with resolved cases of 2019-nCoV can simply donate plasma, and then this plasma can be transfused into infected patients.8 Given that plasma donation is well established, and the transfusion of plasma is also routine medical care, this proposal does not need any new science or medical approvals in order to be put into place. Indeed, the same rationale was used in the treatment of several Ebola patients with convalescent serum during the outbreak in 2014-2015.9 Since the emergence of this SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, it has rapidly spread across China and more than 188 other countries and territories. According to the WHO, as of March 27, 2020, there have been 540,832 confirmed cases worldwide and 24,294 deaths. SARS-CoV-2 has structural similarity to SARS-CoV that caused SARS and MERS-CoV.3 In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, there are 1012 confirmed cases reported till now, with 3 deaths (on March 26, 2020).\n\nThe Saudi government's prompt actions to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 seem to be effective. However, CDC Estimates 40-70% of the US population will be infected with SARS-CoV-2. Even with curtailment measures, judging from past pandemics, approximately 40% of human beings will be exposed to COVID-19 over the next 2-3 years. Most of these infected people will recover and almost all of them will be immune. Vigilance and readiness are needed to teach the masses about preventive measures because older people and those with comorbidities will be the sickest. Contemporaneously, therapeutic measures are highly needed from the medical community to treat COVID-19 patients.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04347681","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

The burden of sepsis is increasing worldwide. It is the cause of 8 million global deaths each year. Currently, treatment options are limited to antimicrobials and supportive care such as intravenous fluids, vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, and renal replacement therapy. In the absence of effective therapies specifically targeting the dysregulated immune response, prolonged use of these life-sustaining therapies can be debilitating. A growing body of evidence suggesting that vitamin C, an inexpensive and readily available intervention, is potentially lifesaving in sepsis. Intravenous vitamin C may be the first therapy to mitigate the dysregulated cascade of events that leads to sepsis. If proven effective, vitamin C could be used worldwide and drastically change outcomes in high- and low-income settings alike. Objectives. To determine whether intravenous vitamin C, compared to placebo, reduces mortality and morbidity in sepsis (induced by bacterial and viral pathogens (as COVID-19)), and compare clinical and biochemical measures of organ dysfunction, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) at 6 months. To ascertain the volume of distribution, clearance, and plasma concentration over a course of 96 hours of intravenous vitamin C 50 mg/kg of weight every 6 hours or matching placebo (pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy). Methods. Patients will be randomly assigned to vitamin C (intravenous, 50 mg/kg every 6h) or placebo (0.9% NaCl or dextrose 5% in water) for 96 hours. Study personnel at the clinical sites will document the composite of death or persistent organ dysfunction at day 28. Daily assessments will occur for organ function, on days 1, 3, 7 for inflammation, infection, and endothelial injury biomarkers, at baseline for vitamin C level, and at 6 months for mortality and HRQoL. The LOVIT Trial will be conducted in adult general Canadian and international intensive care units.

The PK substudy will be conducted with 100 participants in 3 of the 25 participating centers. Relevance. In the context of increasing off-label use of vitamin C for sepsis and ongoing trials of vitamin C bundled with other pharmacological interventions, the LOVIT Trial will constitute a rigorous assessment of the effect of vitamin C monotherapy on patient-important outcomes.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT03680274","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

Collection of these followup items marks the end of the subject's participation in the study. No data collection is planned following the two week study period. The study hypothesis is that subjects receiving the behavior intervention delivered via an automated mobile messaging robot would demonstrate better patient reported outcome survey scores than controls at follow-up.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04329897","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

The primary endpoint of the study is the combination of intubation or death within 7 days of randomization. The secondary endpoint is 30-day mortality. All patients arriving at the ED will be evaluated to verify the presence of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Randomization will be performed through an ad-hoc electronic case report form (eCRF). Eligible patients should be randomized as soon as possible, possibly immediately after the ED triage. Patients randomized to the control arm will be treated according to current clinical practice, which currently does not involve the use of CPAP. Therefore, these patients should not start treatment with CPAP immediately after randomization. CPAP treatment, however, is allowed at a later stage, if deemed appropriate according to clinical judgment. Patients randomized to the experimental arm should begin treatment with CPAP as soon as possible. CPAP should only be performed with a helmet, using a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) between 8 and 14 cmH2O and an inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) between 40 and 60%. FiO2 and PEEP must be modulated, within the limits indicated above, so as to obtain a saturation > 94%.

The median time from onset of symptoms of COVID-19 to development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been reported as short as 9 days. No effective prophylactic or post-exposure therapy is currently available. According to data from the Danish Health Authority (www.sst.dk/corona), as of March 21st, 2020, there were 1326 patients infected with the disease in Denmark, more than 250 are admitted to a hospital, and >50 of them have required intensive care. Nearly 350.000 cases and 15.000 deaths have been reported globally. These numbers are likely to markedly increase during the coming weeks, challenging the capacity of health systems worldwide.\n\nIn patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, it has been described that disease severity and outcomes are related to the characteristics of the immune response. Interleukin (IL)-6 and other components of the inflammatory cascade contribute to host defense against infections. However, exaggerated synthesis of IL-6 can lead to an acute severe systemic inflammatory response known as 'cytokine storm'. In the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, a study found that a cytokine storm involving a considerable release of proinflammatory cytokines occurred, including IL-6, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). Studies on the Middle East respiratory syndrome caused by another coronavirus (MERS-CoV), indicate that cytokine genes of IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-8 can be markedly upregulated. Similarly, patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia admitted to an intensive care unit had higher plasma levels of cytokines including IL-6, IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), interferon-γ-inducible protein (IP10), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP1A), and TNF-α. These findings indicate that the magnitude and characteristics of the cytokine response is related to the severity and prognosis of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\nIt has been suggested that IL-6 blockade may constitute a novel therapeutic strategy for other types of cytokine storm, such as the systemic inflammatory response syndrome including sepsis, macrophage activation syndrome and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Remarkable beneficial effects of IL-6 blockade therapy using a IL-6 receptor inhibitor has been described in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in a retrospective case series from China.\n\nCurrently, there are two available drugs based on human monoclonal antibodies against IL-6 receptor, tocilizumab (RoActemra, Roche) and sarilumab (Kevzara, Sanofi). IL-6 receptor inhibitors are currently licensed for several autoimmune disorders and are considered well tolerated and safe in general. The most common side effects reported are upper respiratory tract infections, headache, hypertension, and abnormal liver function tests. The most serious side effects are serious infections, complications of diverticulitis, and hypersensitivity reactions.\n\nit is hypothesized that IL-6 might play a key role in the cytokine storm associated with serious adverse outcomes in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, and that blockade of IL-6 would be suitable therapeutic target for these patients. The study will investigate the effect of different types of IL-6 inhibition versus no adjuvant treatment compared to standard of care in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\nPrimary objective: To compare the effect of either one of three IL-6 inhibitor administrations, relative to the standard of care, on time to independence from supplementary oxygen therapy, measured in days from baseline to day 28, in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04322773?term=NCT04322773&draw=2&rank=1","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Because SARS-CoV-2 is known to require the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor for uptake into the human body, there have been questions about whether medications that upregulate ACE-2 receptors might increase the risk of infection and subsequent complications. One such group of medications are anti-hypertensives that block the renin-angiotensin system, including both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB). Both ACEi and ARB are widely used for the treatment of hypertension. Early reports from China and Italy suggest that many of those who die from COVID-19 have a coexisting history of hypertension. Consequently, there have been questions raised as to whether these 2 types of blood pressure medication might increase the risk of death among patients with COVID-19. However, it is well known that the prevalence of hypertension increases linearly with age. Therefore, it is possible that the high prevalence of hypertension and ACEi/ARB use among persons who die from COVID-19 is simply confounded by age (older people are at risk of both a history of hypertension and dying from COVID-19). Whether these commonly prescribed blood pressure medications increase the risk of COVID-19 or not remains unanswered. Statements from professional cardiology societies on both sides of the Atlantic have called for urgent research into this question. Our study aims to randomize patients with primary (essential) hypertension who are already taking ACEi/ARB to either switch to an alternative BP medication or continue with the ACEi/ARB that they have already been prescribed. Adults with compelling indications for ACEi/ARB will not be enrolled.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04330300?term=NCT04330300&draw=2&rank=1","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

This new coronavirus was called SARS-CoV-2 and the disease caused by that virus, COVID-19. Recent numbers show that 222,643 infections have been diagnosed with 9115 deaths, worldwide. Currently, there are no approved therapeutic agents available for coronaviruses. In this scenario, the situation of a global public health emergency and evidence about the potential positive effect of chloroquine (CQ) in most coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1, and recent data on small trials on SARS-CoV-2, the investigators intend to investigate the efficacy and the safety of CQ diphosphate in the treatment of hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome in the scenario of SARS-CoV2. Preliminary in vitro studies and uncontrolled trials with low number of patients of CQ repositioning in the treatment of COVID-19 have been encouraging. The main hypothesis is that CQ diphosphate will reduce mortality in 50% in those with severe acute respiratory syndrome infected by the SARS-COV2. Therefore, the main objective is to assess whether the use of chloroquine diphosphate reduces mortality by 50% in the study population. The primary outcome is mortality in day 28 of follow-up. According to local contingency plan, developed by local government for COVID-19 in the State of Amazonas, the Hospital Pronto-Socorro Delphina Aziz, located in Manaus, is the reference unit for the admission of serious cases of the new virus. The unit currently has 50 ICU beds, with the possibility of expanding to 335 beds, if needed. The hospital also has trained multiprofessional human resources and adequate infrastructure. In total, 440 participants (220 per arm) will receive either high dose chloroquine 600 mg bid regime (4x150 mg tablets, every 12 hours, D1-D10) or low dose chloroquine 450mg bid regime (3x150mg tablets + 1 placebo tablet every 12 hours on D1, 3x150mg tablets + 1 placebo followed by 4 placebo tablets 12h later from D2 to D5, and 4 placebo tablets every 12 hours, D6-D10).

COVID-19, the disease caused by this virus, has a very polymorphous clinical presentation, which ranges from upper respiratory tract infections to acute respiratory distress syndrome. It may appear serious straightaway or may evolve in two stages, with a worsening 7 to 10 days after the first clinical signs, potentially linked to a cytokine storm and accompanied by a high risk of thrombosis. The global mortality rate of COVID-19 is between 3% and 4%, with severe forms being more frequent among older patients. Management is symptomatic as no antiviral treatment has demonstrated any clinical benefit in this condition. Hydroxychloroquine is a derivative of chloroquine commonly used in some autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. It is active in vitro in cellular models of infection by many viruses such as HIV, hepatitis C or SARS-CoV. However, its interest in viral infections in humans has not been demonstrated.\n\nVery recently, a preliminary uncontrolled study evaluated the effect of hydroxychloroquine on viral shedding in subjects with COVID-19. Among 20 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 600 mg per day, the percentage of patients with detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the nasopharynx decreased from 100% at inclusion (start of treatment) to 43% six days later. In comparison, 15 of 16 untreated patients had a positive RT-PCR six days after inclusion. Furthermore, hydroxychloroquine has immunomodulating and anti-inflammatory properties, which could theoretically prevent or limit secondary worsening.\n\nThe research hypothesis is that treatment with hydroxychloroquine improves prognosis and reduces the risk of death or use for invasive ventilation in patients with COVID-19.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04325893?term=NCT04325893&draw=2&rank=1","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes"},

Many healthcare systems and organizations are using different protocols and measures to fight the COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir and other antiviral medications are currently under research investigations. Natural honey has been well known for its high health properties in diabetes, nutrition, dyslipidemia, skin lesions and it got FDA approval for topical wound treatment in 2007 as the most potent antimicrobial agent. Honey has been previously considered as an alternative for acyclovir in the treatment of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and it also demonstrated for its significant antiviral effect against varicella zoster virus (VZV). Many studies have demonstrated the broad spectrum antimicrobial effect of honey as an antibacterial, anti fungal, antiviral and antimycobacterial. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the Public Health England (PHE) guidelines recommended honey as a first line of treatment for acute cough caused by upper respiratory tract infection which is currently a cornerstone symptom in COVID-19 infectious disease. Moreover, natural honey should no longer be used as \"alternative\" and deserves to gain more attention by scientists and researchers. The aim of this trial is to study the efficacy of natural honey in treatment of patients infected with COVID-19 in comparison with current standard care.\nMethods:\nThis will be a randomized , multi center, double armed clinical trial, patients will be randomly assigned to two groups on 1:1 basis. Natural honey group will include patients receiving standard care and added intervention in the form of natural honey in a dose of 1gm/kg/day (previously used safely in small studies) divided into 2 to 3 doses for continuous 14 days. The other arm is the arm receiving the standard care according to the center protocol.\nOur primary outcome is days for recovery using the parameters: turning from positive to negative swaps, days from fever to no fever and lung inflammation recovery in x ray or CT, our secondary outcome is the 30 days mortality rate.

The change of laboratory parameters, including elevated serum cytokine, chemokine levels, and increased NLR in infected patients are correlated with the severity of the disease and adverse outcome, suggesting a possible role for hyper-inflammatory responses in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Importantly, previous studies showed that viroporin E, a component of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), forms Ca2C-permeable ion channels and activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. In addition, another viroporin 3a was found to induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation . The mechanisms are unclear.\n\nColchicine, an old drug used in auto-inflammatory disorders (i.e., Familiar Mediterranean Fever and Bechet disease) and in gout, counteracts the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby reducing the release of IL-1b and an array of other interleukins, including IL-6, that are formed in response to danger signals. Recently, colchicine has been successfully used in two cases of life-threatening post-transplant capillary leak syndrome.

While researching for a vaccine has been started, effective therapeutic solutions are urgently needed to face this threaten. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has a relevant role in COVID-19, as the virus will enter host 's cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2); RAS disequilibrium might also play a key role in the modulation of the inflammatory response that characterizes the lung involvement. Angiotensin-(1-7) is a peptide that is downregulated in COVID-19 patient and it may potentially improve respiratory function in this setting.\n\nMethods/Design: The Investigators describe herein the methodology of a randomized, controlled, adaptive Phase II/Phase III trial to test the safety, efficacy and clinical impact of the infusion of angiotensin-(1-7) in COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. A first phase of the study, including a limited number of patients (n=20), will serve to confirm the safety of the study drug, by observing the number of the severe adverse events. In a second phase, the enrollment will continue to investigate the primary endpoint of the study (i.e. number of days where the patient is alive and not on mechanical ventilation up to day 28) to evaluate the efficacy and the clinical impact of this drug. Secondary outcomes will include the hospital length of stay, ICU length of stay, ICU and hospital mortality, time to weaning from mechanical ventilation, reintubation rate, secondary infections, needs for vasopressors, PaO2/FiO2 changes, incidence of deep vein thrombosis, changes in inflammatory markers, angiotensins plasmatic levels and changes in radiological findings. The estimated sample size to demonstrate a reduction in the primary outcome from a median of 14 to 11 days is 56 patients, 60 including a dropout rate of 3% (i.e. 30 per group), but a preplanned recalculation of the study sample size is previewed after the enrollment of 30 patients.\n\nExpected outcomes/Discussion: This controlled trial will assess the efficacy, safety and clinical impact of the Angiotensin-(1-7) infusion in a cohort of COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation. The results of this trial may provide useful information for the management of this disease.\n\nDetailed Description\nRationale for the study The cellular entry of the SARS-CoV-2 can result in a functional reduction of ACE2 activity and this could lead to an increased activity of the Ang II/AT1 axis and decreased levels Ang-(1-7)/MasR expression that could contribute to the severity of the disease. The administration of Ang-(1-7) could reestablish this equilibrium, contributing to decrease pulmonary inflammation e thus decreasing the symptoms of the disease. Eligible patients and the next of kin (whenever possible) should be informed about the rationale and the aims of the study and potential risks of drug infusion. Local ethical regulations should be otherwise followed. Due to the eligibility criteria and the urgency setting, a delayed written consent may be obtained after randomization from the next of kin and/or the patient (i.e. after ICU discharge). Randomization will be performed using sealed envelopes with a ratio of 1:1 including information on treatment assignment and a five-digit number, which will be open by the person responsible for drug constitution. Each vial or syringe will be then labeled with the randomly allocated number it will be assigned to the nursing personnel. The doctors and nurses administering the drugs, as well as the local investigators and research personnel who collected data, were unaware of the treatment assignments. Randomization should occur within 24 hours since orotracheal intubation and drug infusion initiated within 4 hours from randomization. Trial will be conducted in adherence to the current Helsinki Declaration and the standard of good clinical practice. Screening of patients will only start after approval of the ethical committees (EC) in the trial sites. No deviation of the protocol will be implemented without the prior review and approval of the ECs. Study Treatment Ang-(1-7) is a pre-constitute intravenous lyophilized formulation containing 0.5 mg/ ampoule and will be administered to patients via a dedicated central venous line at the initial dose of 0.1 mcg/Kg/h (equivalent to 2.5 mcg/Kg/day). After the first hour of infusion, if no decrease in mean arterial pressure (decrease superior to 30% or need to increase vasopressors ‚â• 50% of an initial dosage to maintain a MAP ‚â• 65mmHg), the infusion rate will be increased to 0.2 mcg/Kg/h (equivalent to 5 mcg/Kg/day). The infusion will be continued for up to 48 hours and then stopped. To this end, the substance solution, prepackaged, will be diluted in 1000ml of NaCl 0.9% and then infused using an infusion pump at corresponding speed. The placebo substance, made up of the vehicle alone, will also be intravenously administrated using the same procedure as that for the substance containing the active principle. Patient's management Management of any underlying comorbidity will be at discretion of the attending physicians; the use of international guidelines for the monitoring and the adequate therapeutic interventions are recommended in all patients. In particular, patients ventilation should be managed according to ATS/ESICM/SCCM 2017 consensus for the ventilation in ARDS patients which suggest low tidal volume ventilation (4-8 mL/Kg predicted body weight) associated with low plateau pressure (<30 cmH2O), high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) associated with recruitment maneuvers and prone positioning for periods longer than 12h in severe ARDS patients. Arterial gas analysis assessment should be performed at maximum intervals of six hours or more often according to the attending physician beliefs. Maintenance fluid should be chosen among balanced crystalloids and the quantity will be decided by the attending physician. Glucose management, nutrition protocols, decision to administer neuromuscular blockade, prone positioning, ECMO, nitric oxide or any other adjunctive therapies will be continued according to center current clinical practice and will be recorded in the CRF file. Weaning procedure Regarding the weaning from mechanical ventilation, in order to standardize and reduce bias we will comply with the following procedures based on ARDS Network protocol (ARDSnet). Each day the patients enrolled will be assessed by the medical staff for the following weaning criteria: 1. FiO2 ‚â§ 0.40 and PEEP ‚â§ 8 cmH2O OR FiO2 < 0.50 and PEEP < 5 cmH2O 2. PEEP and FiO2 ‚â§ values of previous day. 3. No neuromuscular blocking agents 4. Patient has acceptable spontaneous breathing efforts (It will be allowed to decrease the respiratory rate on the ventilator up to 50% for 5 min to detect inspiratory effort) 5. Systolic BP ‚â• 90 mmHg If all the above conditions will be met, medical staff will start a spontaneous breathing test (SBT) for up to 120 minutes using one of the following methods and maintaining a: FiO2 ‚â§ 0.5: 1. T-piece Tube 2. Pressure Support Ventilation ‚â§ 5 cmH2O with PEEP ‚â§ 5 cmH2O 3. CPAP with PEEP ‚â§ 5 cmH2O 4. Tracheal Collar mask To test the tolerance at such measures the medical staff will evaluate the following goals for a minimum of 30 minutes up to 120 minutes: 1. SpO2 ‚â• 90% and / or PaO2 ‚â• 60 mm Hg 2. Mean spontaneous tidal volume ‚â• 4 ml/kg PBW (if measured) 3. Respiratory Rate ‚â§ 35 / min 4. pH ‚â• 7.30 (if measured) 5. No respiratory distress (defined as 2 or more of the following): 1. Heart rate ‚â• 120% of the rate (‚â§ 5 min at > 120% may be tolerated) 2. Marked use of accessory muscles 3. Abdominal paradox 4. Diaphoresis 5. Marked subjective dyspnea If all these goals will be met, the medical staff will consider extubation, otherwise the patient will be treated with the pre-weaning settings. Data Collection Data collection on admission will include: demographic characteristics, comorbidities, including use of antihypertensive medications, source of admission, primary and secondary diagnosis, delay since symptoms begin, APACHE II Score (the worst values within the first 24 hours), SOFA score on admission, Chest X-ray and Thoracic CT scan results if available, EKG trace, PaO2/FiO2 on admission. Daily data collection during ICU stay will include: continuous hemodynamic monitoring, including invasive arterial pressure monitoring and continuous EKG; SaO2 and PaO2/FiO2 every 2 hours; blood samples including Hb, glucose and several other chemical variables will be collected at least once per day at 8 am (or the first value of the day); ventilatory parameters and arterial gas analysis will be also collected every six hours; SOFA score; presence of any other documented infection (site, pathogen, treatment); presence of septic shock; daily diuresis and daily total fluid infusion, urine analysis including main electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium) and osmolarity every morning. The occurrence of serious adverse events (see specific paragraph in the text). Duration of ICU stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, need for tracheostomy. In case of death, reasons for withdrawal of care will be recorded. All the data will be recorded using the specific CRF forms, divided into a core section and a daily section and will be uploaded to a web-centralized protected database. Statistical Analysis First phase (Phase IIb) = 15 vs 15 patients Second phase (Phase III) = expected 30 vs 30 patients in total (recalculation of sample size after 15 vs. 15 patients included) The primary outcome of this study is the number of ventilator free days at day 28. Considering an expected median duration of mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 related respiratory insufficiency patients of 14 days, to provide an absolute reduction of 22,5% with an alpha error of 0.05 and to provide a power to detect the effect of 80% and a dropout rate of 3%, 60 patients will need to be included in the primary analysis, 30 in each group. Pre-planned Stratified group analysis will be performed for the following group of patients: 1. History of hypertension vs. no history of hypertension 2. Treatment with ACEi, ARB or DRI drugs vs no treatment 3. Age (<65 vs. ‚â• 65 years) 4. PaO2/FiO2 values at randomization (<100 vs ‚â• 100) 5. Confirmed vs highly suspected COVID-19 Data Safety Management Members of the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) are individuals free of conflicts of interest for this protocol; DSMC will analyze the safety of the study and their membership within the DSMC will be for the duration of this clinical trial. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be recorded at the participating site on the specific CRF and their occurrence will be monitored by the DSMC at the different interim analysis. Formal meeting will be held for each interim analysis to review the data related to the primary outcome, the safety findings as well as the quality of the trial conduct. To enhance the integrity of the trial, the DSMC will have access to the different results aggregated by treatment group and remain unaware of the treatment assignment (the groups will be encoded as A and B). A report including data on recruitment and baseline characteristics and pooled data on eligibility violations will be prepared by the statistician for each DSMC meeting. Only the independent statistician will have access to the whole database. A closed report will be then prepared to allow confidential discussion of clinical data and the DSMC has to prepare minutes of their meetings, with a list of recommendations for the Steering Committee (to continue, to hold or to terminate the trial). If the recommendation is to stop the trial, a final decision will be made after the analysis of all patients included at the time (including patients randomized after data collection for the DSMC meeting). The Steering Committee will be responsible for deciding whether to continue, hold or stop the trial based on DSMC recommendations. The DSMC will be notified of all changes to the trial protocol or conduct. Organization Data will be recorded using pre-printed CRF by the attending physician or a trained research nurse. All data will be periodically introduced by trained personnel in the central web-based database. The study coordinator will contact each time a patient is included the local PI to ensure data collection and reporting as well as completion of patient follow-up or on premature termination of the study protocol. The individual data provided by a participating ICU are primarily property of the ICU who generated the data. All investigators have the right to access their data every time. The Principal Investigators of the study have the responsibility to perform periodic and spot checks visits to monitor the progress of the clinical study. Completed CRFs will be reviewed for completeness, compliance with investigation plan and appropriate device use and accountability. Case report forms will be uploaded on a website with the help of an independent statistician, which will be overseen data entry and data quality management. Data on safety will be provided to the DMSC with regular time intervals. The steering committee will review study integrity, safety and risk/benefit issues after 25 included patients. The rate of these reviews could increase according to report of relevant safety issues. Independent analyses of serious adverse events will be performed and adjudicated if the frequency or nature of serious adverse events warrants it.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04332666","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

An additional advantage is that they can be scaled-up to generate banks of cryofrozen and thus readily available products. These cells have already been tested in several clinical trials with an excellent safety record.\n\nThe objective of this project is to treat intubated-ventilated patients presenting with a SARS-CoV2-related Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) of less than 96 hours by three intravenous infusions of umbilical cord Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (UC-MSC) one every other day (duration of the treatment: one week). The primary endpoint is the PaO2/FiO2 ratio at day 7. The evolution of several inflammatory markers, T regulatory lymphocytes and donor-specific antibodies will also be monitored. The trial will include 60 patients, of whom 20 will be cell-treated while the remaining 40 patients will be injected with a placebo solution in addition to the standard of care. Given the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV2, it is thus sound to hypothesize that the intravenous administration of UC-MSC during the initial phase of ARDS could control inflammation, accelerate its recovery with improved oxygenation, reduced mechanical ventilation and ventilation weaning time and therefore reduced length of stay in intensive care.\n\nThe feasibility of the project is supported by the expertise of the Méary Cell and Gene Therapy Center, which is approved for the production of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products and has already successfully prepared the first batches of cells, as well as by the involvement of a cardiac surgery team which will leverage its experience with stem cells for the treatment of heart failure to make it relevant to the Stroma-Cov-2 project.\n\nDetailed Description\nGeneral context: As of March 13, 2020, more than 145,000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed with 5,500 deaths worldwide. As of March 21, 14,469 cases have been confirmed in France, of which 562 have been fatal while 1,525 patients are currently hospitalized in intensive care units. Whereas the pandemic continues to spread, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in 30% of patients (Murthy et al., 2020) with a 30%-60% mortality rate. The main physio-pathological hallmark is an acute pulmonary inflammation. Currently, there is no treatment. The objective of this project is to treat intubated-ventilated patients presenting with a SARS-CoV2-related Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) of less than 96 hours by three intravenous infusions of umbilical cord Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (UC-MSC) one every other day (duration of the treatment: one week). The primary endpoint is the PaO2/FiO2 variation from baseline at day 7. The evolution of several inflammatory markers, T regulatory lymphocytes and donor-specific antibodies will also be monitored. The trial will include 60 patients, of whom 20 will be randomized to cell-treatment administered via intravenous route while the remaining 40 patients will be randomized to receive a placebo solution in addition to the standard of care. Patients will be followed up to 12 months after treatment. State of the art: Mesenchymal stem cells feature several attractive characteristics: ease of procurement, high proliferation potential, capacity to home to inflammatory sites, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and immunomodulatory properties. Their therapeutic benefits have been demonstrated in > 100 animal models, including sheep. Specifically, the therapeutic effects of MSC have been demonstrated in ARDS models induced by H1N1, H5N1, H9N2 influenza virus-associated pneumoniae and were also shown to reduce bacterial-induced acute lung injury in a human model of ex vivo perfused lung (Lee et al., 2013). In the clinics, MSC have demonstrated an excellent tolerance in over 3,000 patients (Thompson et al., 2020), regardless of the dosing and delivery route. Three phase I/II trials have included patients with an ARDS and in one (START II), MSC significantly reduced pulmonary endothelial injury (Matthay et al., 2019). If all MSC share several characteristics regardless of the tissue source, the highest productions of bioactive molecules and the strongest immunomodulatory properties are yielded by those from the Wharton's jelly of the umbilical cord (Romanov et al., 2019) which can be scaled-up to generate banks of cryofrozen and thus readily available products. So far, UC-MSC have been used in a wide variety of diseases (reviewed in Scarfe et al., 2018) and, in most cases, they have been delivered via the intravenous route which is clinically attractive because of its non invasive nature and the subsequent possibility of repeated administrations. Labeling techniques have shown that >80% of intravenously injected MSCs are rapidly trapped in the lungs, followed by a rapid distribution of some of the injected MSCs to other tissues including liver, spleen, and inflammatory or injured sites (Brooks et al., 2018). Over all, these biodistribution patterns have been confirmed by human studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) and/or single‚Äêphoton emission computed tomography (SPECT).2 A four-parameter model (injection rate, clearance rate, rate of extravasation and rate of intravasation) predicts that transplanted MSCs are only therapeutically active for a short period of time (probably less than 24 h) (Parekkadan and Milwid, 2010), a timescale consistent with that of the biological responses that they trigger. These assumptions are an incentive to repeated MSC administrations within a short period of time to induce a sustained therapeutic effect and has rationalized our protocol of injecting MSC one every other day over a one week-period, a design consistent with the earlier report of the benefits of delivering MSC at relatively small doses but in a repeated fashion in patients with graft-versus-host disease (Zhou et al., 2010). Once they have homed in the lungs, MSC have been reported to first induce an inflammatory response which is detectable at the tissue level and systemically (Hoogduijn et al., 2013) and is likely due to their interaction with resident lung cells once they have accumulated in the microvasculature. This initial response is then followed by a downstream phase of reduced immune reactivity (Hoogduijn et al., 2013), the mechanisms of which have been extensively investigated. Thus, 24 hours after their intravenous infusion, most of the UC-MSC that have accumulated in the lungs are dead after their phagocytosis by monocytes and neutrophils which then migrate through the blood stream, particularly in the liver (Leibacher et al., 2017; de Witte et al., 2018). Co-culture experiments have shown that the internalization of MSC fragments by monocytes triggers a phenotypic shift which translates into the upregulation of PD-L1 and CD90 along with an increased expression of mRNA levels for IL-1Œ≤, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 and a decreased expression of TNF-Œ±. Of note, monocytes polarized towards an immune-regulatory phenotype increase the expression of Foxp3+ T regulatory lymphocytes while decreasing that of activated CD4+ cells (de Witte et al., 2018). That apoptosis of intravenously infused MSC is a requirement for their immunosuppressive function is further supported by the observation that the cytotoxic activity against MSC is predictive of clinical responses in patients treated by MSC for graft-versus-host disease, i.e., the best responders are those with high cytotoxicity; in this study, the postulated mechanistic link is that phagocytes that have engulfed apoptotic MSC then produce indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and thus ultimately deliver MSC immunosuppressive activity (Galleu et al., 2017). Given the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV2, it is thus sound to hypothesize that the intravenous administration of UC-MSC during the initial phase of ARDS could control inflammation, accelerate its recovery with improved oxygenation, reduced mechanical ventilation and ventilation weaning time and therefore reduced length of stay in intensive care. This assumption is indeed supported by the recent results of a preliminary Chinese trial in which MSC (the source of which has not be specified) have been reported to improve pulmonary function and symptoms in 7 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia along with a rapid clearance of overactivated cytokine-secreting immune cells (CXCR3+CD4+ T cells, CXCR3+CD8+ T cells, and CXCR3+ NK cells), a decrease in TNF-Œ± circulating levels and an increase in CD14+CD11c+CD11bmid regulatory DC cells and IL-10 levels, compared with a placebo group (Leng et al., 2020).","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04333368","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Given its burden, therapies that reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation or decrease the morbimortality are needed. Studies indicate that inflammation and cytokine storm might be involved in the pathophysiological pathway to ARDS in these patients. Corticosteroids have been tested in deferent scenarios of ARDS, including viral pneumonia, and the early use of dexamethasone is safe and appears to reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation in ARDS patients. A recent small retrospective study evaluating the role of corticosteroids found no association between corticosteroids and hospital length of stay, virus clearance, and symptoms' duration. However, the retrospective nature of data, small sample size (31 patients), and no protocol for corticosteroids administration undermine its results. Therefore, the present study will evaluate the effectiveness of dexamethasone compared to control (no corticosteroids) in ventilator-free days at 28 days in patients with moderate and severe ARDS due to SARS-CoV2 virus in Brazil.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04327401","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Interventions to decrease the incidence and severity of COVID-19 are emergently needed. Hydroxychloroquine (brand name, Plaquenil), an inexpensive anti-malarial medication with immunomodulatory effects, is a promising therapy for COVID-19.

In vitro, hydroxychloroquine has been recently shown to have greater efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 versus chloroquine. Currently, there is no established post-exposure prophylaxis for persons at high risk of developing COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine (brand name, Plaquenil), is a medicine that has been found to be effective against the novel coronavirus in some recent experiments.

In virological analyses of samples from the patients' deep respiratory tract, a novel coronavirus was isolated (first named 2019-nCoV, then SARS-CoV-2). The disease spread rapidly in the city of Wuhan in early 2020 and soon beyond. On 30 January 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, and on 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the virus a pandemic. In humans, an infection with the virus can cause respiratory infections and even very severe pneumonia, which often ends fatally, especially in old and previously ill patients. Due to the novelty of the virus, the data basis for therapy is very limited. To date, there are no clinical data for an effective specific therapy, nor is there a vaccination against the virus available, so that therapy, especially intensive care treatment for very severe cases, must concentrate only on supportive treatment of lung failure and other complications. The virus is very contagious and infection results in a relevant number of deaths. Due to very uncertain data on the spread of the virus in the population, it is difficult to estimate the mortality rate - case mortality is about 4% based on known case numbers. In reports on the treatment of the first cases in Wuhan (Hubei Province, China) in January 2020, the need for intensive care treatment is described for about a quarter of the inpatient cases, 10-17% had to be ventilated invasively, and venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vv-ECMO) was necessary in 2-4% of the inpatient cases. Patients requiring ECMO have an extremely high mortality rate of 83-100% in the studies described so far. In severe cases a pronounced release of vasoactive cytokines was repeatedly observed. Excessive release of these vasoactive mediators (\\cytokine storm\\\") can result in pronounced vasodilatation and membrane leakage, which can ultimately lead to severe vasoplegic shock that is difficult to control. Ruan et al. and Zhou et al. have identified high interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels as a potential predictor of a fatal outcome when compared between survivors and patients who died of COVID-19 disease. IL-6 is also an important factor in the pathophysiology of severe septic shock and excessive immune response in hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) - for both indications has been shown, that the extracorporeal adsorption of IL-6 and other vasoactive substances in a CytoSorb¬Æ adsorber (CytoSorbents Corporation, Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA) leads to a significant reduction of these cytokines in the patient blood. Clinical experience and (previously unpublished) data from our monocentric registry study show that cytokine adsorption in a CytoSorb¬Æ Adsorber can also be safely integrated into a vv-ECMO system. The aim of the study is to investigate the influence of extracorporeal cytokine adsorption on humoral inflammation parameters and patient survival under controlled conditions in patients with severe COVID-19 disease requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.\"","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04324528","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Outbreaks have been reported in more than 50 countries with more than 118,223 confirmed cases and 4,291 deaths worldwide. In Italy, the scenario is progressively worsening with 8514 confirmed cases and 631 deaths at 10/3/2020. Along with the spread of this new virus there has been an increase in the number of pneumonia identified with the term novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (NCIP), which are characterized by fever, asthenia, dry cough, lymphopenia, prolonged prothrombin time, elevated lactic dehydrogenase, and a tomographic imaging indicative of interstitial pneumonia (ground glass and patchy shadows). Recent studies have shown the efficacy of vitamin C and thiamine administration in patients hospitalized for sepsis in the setting of intensive wards in terms of mortality reduction. The use of intravenously vitamin C arises from the experimental evidence of its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Vitamin C causes a greater proliferation of natural killers without affecting their functionality. Moreover, the vitamin C reduces the production of ROS (reactive oxygen species) that contribute to the activation of the inflammosomi and, in particular, the NLRP3 that affetcs the maturation and secretion of cytokines such as IL1beta and IL-18 that are involved in the inflammatory systemic syndrome that characterized sepsis. Vitamin C blocks the expression of ICAM-1 and activation of NFKappaB that are involved in inflammatory, neoplastic, and apoptotic processes by the inhibition of TNFalfa. For this reason, the use of vitamin C could be effective in terms of mortality and secondary outcomes in the cohort of patients with covid-19 pneumonia. In view of the emergency of SARS-VOC-2 and the impossibility of carrying out a randomized controlled study, it is their intention to conduct an intervention protocol (administration of 10 grams of vitamin C intravenously in addition to conventional therapy) involving the cohort of hospitalized patients with covid-19 pneumonia. Methods: An uncontrolled longitudinal study will be conducted at the Arnas Civico-di Cristina-Benfratelli National Relevance Hospital in Palermo. This study will include all patients consecutively hospitalized with positive swab test of SARS-CoV-2 and interstitial pneumonia or with interstitial pneumonia with indication of intubation.

Length of hospital stay will be recorded. After written informed consent, 10 grams of vitamin C in 250 ml of saline to infuse at a rate of 60 drops / minute will be administered. In-hospital mortality, reduction of PCR levels > 50% in comparison with PCR levels at the admission within 72 hours after the administration, lactate clearance, length of hospital stay, resolution of symptoms, duration of positive swab (days).

(1,2) The exacerbated inflammatory response in COVID-19 infected critically ill patients calls for appropriate anti inflammatory therapeutics combined with antiviral effects. Thus, drugs combining anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects may reduce the symptoms of respiratory distress caused by COVID-19. This dual effect may simultaneously protect severely ill patients and reduce the viral load, therefore limiting virus dissemination. Naproxen, an approved anti-inflammatory drug, is an inhibitor of both cyclo oxygenase (COX-2) and of Influenza A virus nucleoprotein (NP). The NP of Coronavirus (CoV), positive-sense single-stranded viruses, share with negative-sense single-stranded viruses as Influenza the ability to bind to- and protect genomic RNA by forming self-associated oligomers in a helical structure with RNA. Naproxen was shown to bind the Influenza A virus NP making electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with conserved residues of the RNA binding groove and C terminal domain. (3) Consequently, naproxen binding competed with NP association with viral RNA and impeded the NP self-association process which strongly reduced viral transcription/replication. This drug may have the potential to present antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2 suggested by modelling work based on the structures of CoV NP. The high sequence conservation within the coronavirus family, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the present SARSCoV-2 coronavirus allows to perform this comparison. (4) A recent clinical trial shown that the combination of clarithromycin, naproxen and oseltamivir reduced mortality of patients hospitalized for H3N2 Influenza infection. (5).

According to the WHO, Health-care workers (HCW) face an elevated risk of exposure to - and infection of Covid-19. Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) was developed as a vaccine against tuberculosis, but studies have shown its ability to induce potent protection against other infectious diseases: the so called non-specific effects (NSEs). A favorable in vitro or in vivo effect has been observed in studies for distinct viral pathogens, e.g. respiratory syncytial virus, yellow fever, herpes simplex virus; human papilloma virus. Based on the capacity of BCG to reduce the incidence of respiratory tract infections in children, to exert antiviral effects in experimental models; and to reduce viremia in an experimental human model of viral infection, the hypothesis is that BCG vaccination induces (partial) protection against susceptibility to and/or severity of Covid-19 infection. This study evaluates the efficacy of BCG to improve the clinical course of Covid-19 infection and to prevent absenteeism in order to safeguard continuous patient care. This randomized controlled trial has been designed as a pragmatic study with a highly feasible primary endpoint, which is unplanned absenteeism, that can be continuously measured on a bi-weekly basis). This allows for the most rapid identification of a beneficial outcome that would allow other HCWs to also benefit from the intervention if and as soon as it has been demonstrated to be effective.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04328441","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

The patients with low immunity have more serious conditions. At present, there is no specific drug/therapy available for COVID-19. NK cells are the major cells of the natural immune system, which are essential for innate immunity and adaptive immunity, and are indispensable in the defense of virus infection. NKG2D is an activating receptor of NK cells, which can recognize and thus clear virus infected cells. NK cells modified by CAR play a role in targeted cell therapy, and have benn demonstrated very safe without severe side effects such as cytokine releasing syndromes. The survival time of NK cells will be very short if there is no IL-15-sustained support after adoptive transfer into the body. In comparison with natural IL-15 in vivo, IL-15 superagonist (sIL-15/IL-15Rɑ chimeric protein) has increased the activity by nearly 20 times and as well as improved pharmacokinetic characteristics with longer persistence and enhanced target cytotoxicity. CAR-T cell-mediated cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity have been shown to be abrogated through GM-CSF neutralization. ACE2 is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and binds to S protein of the virus envelope. We have constructed and prepared the universal off-the-shelf IL15 superagonist- and GM-CSF neutralizing scFv-secreting NKG2D-ACE2 CAR-NK derived from cord blood. By targeting the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and NKG2DL on the surface of infected cells with ACE2 and NKG2D, respectively, and with the strong synergistic effect of IL15 superagonist and CRS prevention through GM-CSF neutralizing scFv, we hope that the SARS-CoV-2 virus particles and their infected cells can be safely and effectively removed, thus providing a safe and effective cell therapy for COVID-19. In addition, ACE2 CAR-NK cells can competitively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection of type II alveolar epithelial cells and other important organ or tissue cells through ACE2 so as to make SARS-CoV-2 abortive infection (i.e., no production of infectious virus particles).\n\nThis project is an open, randomized, parallel, multicenter phase I/II clinical trial. The NKG2D-ACE2 CAR-NK cells secreting super IL15 superagonist and GM-CSF neutralizing scFv are going to be give by intravenous infusion (108 cells per kilogram of body weight, once a week) for the treatment of 30 patients with each common, severe and critical type COVID-19, respectively.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04324996","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Pulmonary infections are the leading causes of ARDS. Clinical and experimental research has established a strong association between dysregulated systemic and pulmonary inflammation and progression or delayed resolution of ARDS. The COVID-19 pandemic is a critical moment for the world. Severe pneumonia is the main condition leading to ARDS requiring weeks of MV with high mortality (40-60%) in COVID-19 patients. There is no specific therapy for Covid-19, although patients are receiving drugs that are already approved for treating other diseases. There has been great interest in the role of corticosteroids to attenuate the pulmonary and systemic damage in ARDS patients because of their potent anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic properties. However, the efficacy of corticosteroids in viral ARDS remains controversial. We justify the need of this study based on the positive results of a recent clinical trial by our group, showing that dexamethasone for 10 days was able to reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) and increase hospital survival in patients with ARDS from multiple causes (Villar J et al. Lancet Respir Med 2020). Dexamethasone has never been evaluated in viral ARDS in a randomized controlled fashion.

This disease is not only a health problem but also economy, culture and the whole entity of the countries is under attack by the virus. This disease seems to affect the body in two different pathology pathways. From one side virus can decrease activity of immune system in the blood stream and whole body and from other side it can attack the respiratory cells. Tissue biopsy shows that immune cells penetrate into the Lung tissue and we have accumulation and over activity of Immune cells in the lung. This inflammation in respiratory tract probably is the major cause of Cytokine storm and release of TNF-α and IL-6 into the blood.\n\nIt seems that by three strategy disease can be treated. 1- By using systemic immune simulators. 2- By using topical anti-inflammatory drug in the respiratory system (Steroids or NSAIDs) 3- By inhibition of replication of the virus in the attacked cells.\n\nDetailed Description\n\nLooking at the pathology of this disease shows that COVID-19 virus binds to the Angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE II) which is located on the surface of different cells in the body and specially on the cells of respiratory system. This enzyme is responsible to turn angiotensin II into angiotensin1-7. It is also turns angiotensin I into angiotensin 1-9. When ACEII would be blocked by virus level of angiotensin II will be increased and this enzyme along with vasoconstriction, makes cells to manufacture TNF Œ± and IL-6 which are responsible for cytokine storm and Lymphopenia. Also presence of virus and virus shell on the surface of the infected cells make immune system to attack to the respiratory system hence effect of angiotensin II inside the cell causes fibrosis of the respiratory cells. This inflammation and tissue damage make Acute Respiratory Distress syndrome (ARDS) which is lethal for patients. There is a dilemma in treatment of this infection. From one side it doesn't make sense to decrease the immune response hence it will make the infection worse. And from other side stimulation of the immune response because of respiratory inflammation can expedite process of lethal ARDS. A new strategy for treatment of this disease which consists of local anti- inflammatory and systemic immune stimulant drugs can be considered as a reasonable strategy.As immunostimulator, Levamisole can increase Lymphocytes and empower the immunity of the body. This drug can also bind to Papaine Like Protease(PL-pro) of the shell of the virus which is necessary for virulence of COVID-19. It also can decrease level of TNF Œ± and IL-6, and as a chemical adjutant can introduce the virus to the immune system. In addition to Levamisole, Formoterol+Budesonide inhaler can be used in this protocol. Budesonide is a steroid and can suppress the immune reaction locally in the respiratory system. Formoterol is Œ≤2 agonist and can open airways. It also can bind to PL-pro and can neutralize the virus according to the published articles.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04331470","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

GMCSF, a pleiotropic cytokine, is an important leukocyte growth factor known to play a key role in hematopoiesis, effecting the growth and maturation of multiple cell lineages as well as the functional activities of these cells in antigen presentation and cell mediated immunity. Leukine inhalation or intravenous administration, as an adjuvant therapy, may confer benefit to patients with ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) due to COVID-19 exposure, who are at significant risk of mortality. While there is no active IND (Investigational New Drug) for Leukine in the proposed patient population, Leukine is being studied in Fase II as an adjuvant therapy in the management of life-threatening infections to boost the hosts innate immune response to fight infection, reduce the risk of secondary infection, and in varied conditions as prevention of infection during critical illness.

This virus family causes upper respiratory tract disease and sometimes severe and fatal lung disease, as in the past: SARS-CoV and -MERS-CoV. Since the outbreak of the pandemic there has been a constant search for effective drug treatment for the disease. Following IN-VITRO evidence of the antiviral effect of CHLOROQUINE in CORONA viruses, this drug has been used empirically for COVID-19 patients and is currently recommended in Israel for the treatment of intermediate and severity disease. Currently, it is not common to treat patients with mild illness or asymptomatic carriers. In these situations, isolation is recommended until upper respiratory tract surfaces no longer show the presence of the virus, a period of approximately 20 days. . The mechanism of action of chloroquine is in part by inhibiting the virus distribution, and changing the intracellular acidity, the virus distribution site. The intracellular chloroquine concentration is determined by a pump called PGP that removes the drug from the cell and is activated by the drug. In the treatment of malaria, the benefit of low dosage of the drug has been shown to be effective due to the fact that the intracellular concentration of the drug is probably higher, and therefore the logic to examine this issue in COVID-19 treatment. The purpose of this study is to test whether a low dose of Chloroquine will reduce the duration of the viral shedding and prevent the disease from worsening. Reducing the duration of viral shedding, shortens the time when there is a risk that the person will spread the disease, and the time when the person is in isolation and cannot return to his normal life. The trial will be conducted in two stages, first in patients with mild-grade symptomatology disease , and then, depending on the results of the first phase, we will condider chloroquine therapy in asymptomatic patients (carriers only) to reduce the duration of viral shedding and prevent the onset of symptomatic disease. (Chloroquine dosage at this stage will be determined by the results of the first stage) In the first stage, patients will be recruited at a slight level and will compare two doses of chloroquine (low and normal) with stadard of care.

Progress between Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the experiment will be contingent upon receiving a renewed approval from the Helsinki Committee, based on an interim report to be submitted.

The elevated death risk estimates are probably associated with a breakdown of the healthcare system, indicating that enhanced public health interventions, including social distancing and movement restrictions, should be implemented to bring the COVID-19 epidemic under control.\\\" March 21st 2020 -Much of the United States is currently under some form of self- or mandatory quarantine as testing abilities ramp up.. March 24th, 2020 - Hot spots are evolving and identified, particularly in the areas of New York-New Jersey, Washington, and California Immediate attention is turned to testing, diagnosis, epidemiological containment, clinical trials for drug testing started, and work on a long-term vaccine started. The recovering patients are presenting with mild to severe lung impairment as a result of the viral attack on the alveolar and lung tissues. Clinically significant impairment of pulmonary function appears to be a permanent finding as a direct result of the interstitial lung damage and inflammatory changes that accompanied. This Phase 0, first-in-kind for humans, is use of autologous, cSVF deployed intravenously to examine the anti-inflammatory and structural potential to improve the residual damaged tissues. Previous utilization of cSVF remains in Clinical Trials at this moment for uses in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrotic Lung disorders, showing encouraging safety profile and clinical efficacy. It is the intention of this study, driven by the ongoing pandemic as a direct causative etiology for permanent lung damage within the oxygen/carbon dioxide exchange resulting the the direct alveolar disruption and scarring reaction. The inflammatory mediation, autoimmune modulatory capabilities, and revascularization potentials of the cSVF is becoming well recognized and documented in peer-reviewed literature and in scientific studies. Due to the urgency presented from the ongoing CoronaVirus pandemic, many patients that survive experience demonstrate direct pulmonary damage residua. There is available a relative new technology offered by Fluidda Inc in European Union (EU) known as \\\"Functional Respiratory Imaging (FRI) and examines pulmonary function and vascular capabilities in damaged lung tissues. This study examines the lung baseline (post-infection), and at 3 and 6 month intervals post-cSVF treatment to examine the functional airway configuration and efficiency at those intervals. Sporadic reports of use of stem cells or stem/stromal cells have revealed some positive clinical outcomes, although not within a traditional randomized trial format at this point in time. This study proposed in the specific situation of permanent residual dysfunction created by the SARS-Co2 (Coronavirus) infection is felt to warrant a pilot study using the cSVF that is in current Clinical Trials, which, at this point presents a very good safety profile with the absence of adverse event (AE) or severe adverse events (SAE) as yet reported by the trials.\"","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04326036","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

More than 400 articles have been published and more than 160 clinical trials are registered but no specific treatment has been successful as of March 2020. Antiviral drugs Lopinavir-Ritonavir did not show any significant benefit compared to standard care in a Chinese randomized controlled study with 199 patients. Even though the overall mortality is low (0.2-7.2% the figures from critical care are fearsome. Mortality rates have been reported as high as 90% in patients developing Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in early reports from the Wuhan province and more recent reports has reported overall 28-d mortality rates of 61,5% in ICU patients with acute respiratory illness (ALI), almost double the mortality of ARDS of any cause. ARDS associated with COVID-19 differs from other described ARDS with rapidly progressing respiratory failure and fibrosis. The mechanism behind the rapid progress is still an enigma but theories have evolved around severe inflammatory involvement with a cytokine storm. Macrophage activation is involved in the early phase of ARDS and cytokine modulators such as Interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitors have been tried in experimental settings but no proper clinical trials have proven positive outcome. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) significantly reduces inflammatory cytokines including IL-1Œ≤, IL-6 and TNF-Œ± through several transcription factors regulating inflammation, including Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 (HIF-1), Nrf2 and NFkB. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) has been used for almost a century, initially for decompression sickness, but it nowadays mainly used for its anti-inflammatory effects. Several randomized clinical trials have been conducted on humans for a variety of inflammatory diseases including diabetic foot ulcers and radiation injury. HBO is generally regarded as safe with very few adverse events. The broad and physiological anti-inflammatory effects of HBO shown in extensive experimental and clinical evidence suggest that HBO is a promising drug to ameliorate ARDS associated with COVID-19.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04327505","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

These patients often require intubation and ventilator support in order to sustain adequate oxygenation. Once a COVID-19 patient is intubated, Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) is a mainstay of treatment and is used in order to improve lung function, treat underlying atelectasis, improve oxygenation, and improve survival. In fact, early clinical data as well as reports from front line physicians treating COVID-19 suggest that PEEP has been the most effective treatment modality. In many cases, PEEP has resulted in improved oxygenation and improved survival. PEEP decreases the propensity for the alveoli to collapse by increasing the air pressure in the lungs. This residual pressure in the lungs at the end of exhalation decreases shunting and allows for more complete gas exchange and improved oxygenation. In patients, PEEP is one of the safest ways to increase PaO2 and is used on almost all modern ventilator settings. The GO2 PEEP MOUTHPIECE is a simple, comfortable, and straightforward mouthpiece with a bidirectional valve that effectively delivers PEEP with every breath. Early application of the GO2 PEEP MOUTHPIECE in non-intubated COVID-19 patients may improve outcomes and save lives. Furthermore, this device may allow for less strain on limited resources, especially ventilators. This PEEP mouthpiece could be employed under an oxygen non-rebreather mask to improve oxygenation and avoid intubation.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04331366","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

It has been designed in accordance with CONSORT guidelines. Randomization will be stratified by age (<50 and ‚â•50) and study site. Participants will be healthcare workers at risk for contracting SARS-CoV-2. Participants will be randomized into one of four arms: - Low-dose (300mg chloroquine base weekly); - Medium-dose (300mg chloroquine base twice weekly); - High-dose (150 mg chloroquine base daily); - Placebo. In all treatment arms, an induction dose of 1200mg chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine base (or equivalent number of placebo tablets in the placebo arm) will be taken in 4 divided daily doses (that is 300mg chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine base per day for four days) before starting the low, medium, or high dose regimen . In certain countries (especially where malaria is not endemic), hydroxychloroquine is more readily available and will be used instead of chloroquine. Based on in vitro studies and reviews of drug toxicity , we consider 150mg of hydroxychloroquine base to be equivalent to 150mg of chloroquine base in terms of efficacy. New dosage-based arm(s) might be added or removed. The trial will evaluate which of the intervention arms is most effective at decreasing the incidence of severe COVID-19 disease, without unacceptable side effects or safety events. Participants will complete weekly (smart phone- based) data logs, and follow- up information will be collected until 2 months after enrolment or death. In addition, where possible, we will use telemedicine approaches to collection information on participants. The study flow overview is outlined in Figure 4.

At the time of writing, there have been 150 000 confirmed cases and 3500 deaths. Apart from the morbidity and mortality directly related to COVID-19 cases, society has had to also cope with complex political and economic repercussions of this disease.\n\nAt present, and despite pressing need for therapeutic intervention, management of patients with COVID-19 is entirely supportive. Despite the majority of patients experiencing a mild respiratory illness a subgroup, and in particular those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, will experience severe illness that requires invasive cardiorespiratory support in the intensive care unit.\n\nFurthermore, the severity of COVID-19 disease (as well as the likelihood of progressing to severe disease) appears to be in part driven by direct injury to the cardiovascular system. Analysis of data from two recent studies confirms a significantly higher likelihood of acute cardiac injury in patients who have to be admitted to intensive care for the management of COVID-19 disease.\n\nThe exact type of acute of cardiac injury that COVID-19 patients suffer remains unclear. There is however mounting evidence that heart attack like events are responsible. Tests ordinarily performed to definitely assess for heart attacks will not be possible in very sick COVID-19 patients. Randomising patients to cardioprotective medicines will help us understand the role of the cardiovascular system in COVID-19 disease. It will also help us determine if there is more we can do to treat these patients.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04333407","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

We evaluate the role of hydroxychloroquine on respiratory viral loads. PATIENTS AND METHODS: French Confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in a single arm protocol from early March to March 16(th), to receive 600mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and their viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs was tested daily in a hospital setting. Depending on their clinical presentation, azithromycin was added to the treatment. Untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the protocol were included as negative controls. Presence and absence of virus at Day6-post inclusion was considered the end point. RESULTS: Six patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and eight had lower respiratory tract infection symptoms. Twenty cases were treated in this study and showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage at D6-post inclusion compared to controls, and much lower average carrying duration than reported of untreated patients in the literature. Azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination. CONCLUSION: Despite its small sample size our survey shows that hydroxychloroquine treatment is significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients and its effect is reinforced by azithromycin.","entry_type":"results_pub","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102549/","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Two Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kits based on recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (rN) and spike protein (rS) were used for detecting IgM and IgG antibodies, and their diagnostic feasibility was evaluated.Results: Among the 214 patients, 146 (68.2%) and 150 (70.1%) were successfully diagnosed with the rN-based IgM and IgG ELISAs, respectively; 165 (77.1%) and 159 (74.3%) were successfully diagnosed with the rS-based IgM and IgG ELISAs, respectively. The positive rates of the rN-based and rS-based ELISAs for antibody (IgM and/or IgG) detection were 80.4% and 82.2%, respectively. The sensitivity of the rS-based ELISA for IgM detection was significantly higher than that of the rN-based ELISA. We observed an increase in the positive rate for IgM and IgG with an increasing number of days post-disease onset (d.p.o.), but the positive rate of IgM dropped after 35 d.p.o. The positive rate of rN-based and rS-based IgM and IgG ELISAs was less than 60% during the early stage of the illness 0-10 d.p.o., and that of IgM and IgG was obviously increased after 10 d.p.o.Conclusions: ELISA has a high sensitivity, especially for the detection of serum samples from patients after 10 d.p.o, it can be an important supplementary method for COVID-19 diagnosis.","entry_type":"results_pub","url":"https://jcm.asm.org/content/early/2020/03/27/JCM.00461-20","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"no","is_observational":"yes"},

This virus can infect the respiratory (breathing) system. Some people do not have symptoms but can carry the virus and pass it on to others. People who have developed the condition may develop a fever and/or a continuous cough among other symptoms. This can develop into pneumonia. Pneumonia is a chest infection where the small air pockets of the lungs, called alveoli, fill with liquid and make it more difficult to breathe.\nIn 2020, the virus has spread to many countries around the world and neither a vaccine against the virus or specific treatment for COVID-19 has yet been developed. As of March 2020, it is advised that people minimize travel and social contact, and regularly wash their hands to reduce the spread of the virus.\nCOVID-19 disproportionately affects people aged over 50 years with other illnesses and those over 65 years old. The infection causes considerable illness and the risk of death in this population group in particular and is having a devastating effect on people's health and society internationally. So far, there are no proven COVID-19 specific treatments. Most cases are being managed in the community. It is essential to identify treatments that reduce the severity of the infection. An ideal treatment would one that is safe, with few side effects, helps prevent disease worsening, and can be given in the community using existing NHS processes and capability. This study will, in the first instance, evaluate a drug called hydroxychloroquine. This is a drug that is already available within the NHS but that has not been tested for this disease in Europe or in community healthcare settings with the aim of reducing the need for hospital assessment.\n\nWho can participate?\nPatients with symptoms of possible COVID-19 (continuous cough and/or high temperature) that started within the last 7 days, either aged 65 and over, or aged 50 and over with the following listed illnesses: known weakened immune system due to serious illness or infection (e.g. chemotherapy), known heart disease, known asthma or lung disease, known diabetes not treated with insulin, known mild hepatic impairment, or known stroke or neurological problem.\n\nWhat does the study involve?\nParticipants are randomly allocated to undergo standard care or hydroxychloroquine drug treatment plus standard care. The study drug is hydroxychloroquine sulphate 200 mg tablets. The tablets are for oral use, one tablet (200 mg) taken twice daily for 7 days by mouth (14 tablets in total). This is the standard dose for its normal use in adults. Each dose should be taken with a meal or glass of milk. Antacids may reduce the absorption of hydroxychloroquine so it is advised that a 4-hour interval be observed between taking hydroxychloroquine and an antacid.\n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating?\nBy taking part in this study, participants will be contributing towards the understanding of how doctors can treat COVID-19 and how the symptoms progress. This may help to reduce the duration and severity of symptoms when people fall ill and reduce the burden on the NHS during this crisis. All participants will also receive a swab, and will be told if the swab is positive or not for COVID-19. With any medicine, including ones that are already used within the NHS, there is a risk of side effects. For the treatment in this study the common side effects include abdominal pain, decreased appetite, diarrhoea, headache, nausea, skin reactions, vision changes, and vomiting. Participants will be able to report whether they are experiencing any of these symptoms in the daily diary.\n\nWhere is the study run from?\nAll participating GP practices in England, managed by the University of Oxford Primary Care and Vaccines Clinical Trials Unit co-operative (UK)\n\nWhen is the study starting and how long is it expected to run for?\nMarch 2020 to March 2021\n\nWho is funding the study?\nOffice of the Chief Medical Officer (UK)\n\nWho is the main contact?\n1.

It started in a city in China and has now spread to several other countries around the world, including the United Kingdom. There is no vaccine or treatment for COVID-19 at the moment and governments are trying hard to stop it from spreading by making sure that infected people are identified as soon as possible and kept away from others. To know who has the infection you need to do a test and at the moment this is done in large laboratories within hospitals. Although laboratory testing is accurate, it takes a long time to get results back, leading to long delays in identifying positive cases and in identifying patients who are negative. Companies have developed tests for COVID-19 that can be performed outside of the laboratory and take just one hour to give a result. Having a rapid test result may allow doctors to identify infected patients much more rapidly and to stop the virus from spreading in hospitals. It may also identify those who are not infected much earlier allowing them to be taken out of isolation rooms earlier and sent home quickly, easing pressure on the NHS. Previous studies showed that rapidly testing for viruses close to the patient, rather than in laboratories, leads to improvement in patient care. The aim of this study is to find out whether using a new rapid test for COVID-19 performed near the patient leads to earlier decision making and better care for patients.\n\nWho can participate?\nPatients aged 18 and over with suspected COVID-19\n\nWhat does the study involve?\nPatients will have a nose and throat swab collected and tested immediately using the new rapid test (QIAstat-Dx Respiratory n-CoV Panel). Results are available in one hour and will be communicated immediately to clinical and infection control teams.

Previous studies on SARS have shown that type I interferons (such as IFN-α, IFN -β) can effectively inhibited the replication of SARS virus[Guido AntonelliThe Lancet ,2003]. However, IFN-α/β were considered to be related to the continuous inflammatory response of the host. Animal experiments suggested that IFN-α/β therapy induced influx of pathogenic inflammatory monocytes and vascular leakage, which would aggregate inflammatory damages. Furthermore, systemic adverse reactions of IFN-α/β would also be a source of concern. [Rudragouda ChannappanavarCell Host & Microbe ,2016]. IFN-κ is a relatively mild type I interferon, which can effectively inhibit the replication of envelope viruses without aggravating the inflammatory damage （Patent application No：201710668628.2 / PCT/CN2017/116350）. On the other hand, TFF2 is a small peptide with stable structure. Our work suggested that TFF2 protein reduced the morbidity and mortality of influenza virus infection by restricting the inflammatory response and promoting the repairment of respiratory mucosa. Therefore, TFF2 would also play an important role in the protection of new respiratory tract viral infections (such as Wuhan new coronavirus infection) （Patent application No：201610104936.8）. IFN-κ and TFF2 would work together in restricting the replication of the Co-V and reducing in situ pathological damage at the same time, which would be promising in curing respiratory diseases caused by nCo-V. Based on the above, we are planning a clinical trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of combined inhalation of IFN-κ and TFF2 in treatment of nCo-V-infected patients.

Clostridium Butyricum is a butyric acid-producing bacterium, which tolerate gastric acid and bile and colonize in the gut. Butyric acid, an important nutrient, can repair the damaged intestinal mucosa, eliminate inflammation and nourish the intestine. Clostridium butyricum promotes growth of probiotics, such as Bifidobacterium, and inhibits growth of pathogens, including Shigella. Bacillus Coagulans can tolerate gastric acid and bile. It ferments the lactic acid in the gut, where the concentration of oxygen is very low, to reduce intestinal pH value. In such a way, it inhibits growth of pathogens and promote growth of probiotics such as Bifidobactericum. Bacillus Coagulans can generate short chain fatty acid which can modulate host inflammation and promote immune tolerance against a variety of bacterial and viral pathogens. In 2008, the study of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in American demonstrated that higher representation of butyrate-producing bacteria in the fecal microbiota is associated with increased resistance against respiratory vial infection. It is also recommended in the Guideline for Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (5th version) that intestinal probiotics can maintain microbiota balance in the gut and prevent secondary bacterial infection. Therefore, 300 subjects will be included in the study. In addition to regular medication for NCP, subjects in the test group will take Live Clostridium Butyricum Capsules and Live Bacillus Coagulans Tablets for 14 days, and subjects in the control group will take regular medication for NCP.

METHODS: We conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao(2)) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao(2)) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio(2)) of less than 300 mm Hg. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir-ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first. RESULTS: A total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir-ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group. Treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72). Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir-ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs. 25.0%; difference, -5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, -17.3 to 5.7). The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar. In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir-ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir-ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group. Lopinavir-ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir-ritonavir treatment beyond standard care. Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit.

On January 30, 2020, the first laboratory-confirmed case of COVID was reported from Kerala, India. In view of the earlier evidence about effectiveness of repurposed lopinavir/ritonavir against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (CoV), as well as preliminary docking studies conducted by the ICMR-National Institute of Virology, Pune, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization approved the restricted public health use of lopinavir/ritonavir combination amongst symptomatic COVID-19 patients detected in the country. Hospitalized adult patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with any one of the following criteria will be eligible to receive lopinavir/ritonavir for 14 days after obtaining written informed consent: (i) respiratory distress with respiratory rate ≥22/min or SpO2 of <94 per cent; (ii) lung parenchymal infiltrates on chest X-ray; (iii) hypotension defined as systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg or need for vasopressor/inotropic medication; (iv) new-onset organ dysfunction; and (v) high-risk groups - age >60 yr, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, chronic lung disease and immunocompromised persons. Patients will be monitored to document clinical (hospital length of stay and mortality at 14, 28 and 90 days), laboratory (presence of viral RNA in serial throat swab samples) and safety (adverse events and serious adverse events) outcomes. Treatment outcomes amongst initial cases would be useful in providing guidance about the clinical management of patients with COVID-19. If found useful in managing initial SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, further evaluation using a randomized control trial design is warranted to guide future therapeutic use of this combination.","entry_type":"protocol","url":"http://www.ijmr.org.in/preprintarticle.asp?id=280484;type=0","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

The virus has since rapidly spread to all provinces and autonomous regions of China, and to countries outside of China. Patients who become infected with 2019-nCoV may initially develop mild upper respiratory tract symptoms. However, a significant fraction of these patients goes on to subsequently develop serious lower respiratory disease. The effectiveness of adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy uses in the management of 2019-nCoV infected patients with severe lower respiratory tract infections is not clear, and warrants further investigation. METHODS: The present study will be conducted as an open-labelled, randomised controlled trial. We will enrol 48 subjects from Chongqing Public Health Medical Center. Each eligible subject will be assigned to an intervention group (methylprednisolone via intravenous injection at a dose of 1-2mg/kg/day for 3 days) or a control group (no glucocorticoid use) randomly, at a 1:1 ratio. Subjects in both groups will be invited for 28 days of follow-up which will be scheduled at 4 consecutive visit points. We will use the clinical improvement rate as our primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints include the timing of clinical improvement after intervention, duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of hospitalization, overall incidence of adverse events, as well as rate of adverse events at each visit, and mortality at 2 and 4 weeks. DISCUSSION: The present coronavirus outbreak is the third serious global coronavirus outbreak in the past two decades. Oral and parenteral glucocorticoids have been used in the management of severe respiratory symptoms in coronavirus-infected patients in the past. However, there remains no definitive evidence in the literature for or against the utilization of systemic glucocorticoids in seriously ill patients with coronavirus-related severe respiratory disease, or indeed in other types of severe respiratory disease. In this study, we hope to discover evidence either supporting or opposing the systemic therapeutic administration of glucocorticoids in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.

Although the virus (SARS-Cov-2) nucleic acid RT-PCR test has become the standard method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, these real-time PCR test kits have many limitations. In addition, high false negative rates were reported. There is an urgent need for an accurate and rapid test method to quickly identify large number of infected patients and asymptomatic carriers to prevent virus transmission and assure timely treatment of patients. We have developed a rapid and simple point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay which can detect IgM and IgG antibodies simultaneously against SARS-CoV-2 virus in human blood within 15 minutes which can detect patients at different infection stages. With this test kit, we carried out clinical studies to validate its clinical efficacy uses. The clinical detection sensitivity and specificity of this test were measured using blood samples collected from 397 PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients and 128 negative patients at 8 different clinical sites. The overall testing sensitivity was 88.66% and specificity was 90.63%. In addition, we evaluated clinical diagnosis results obtained from different types of venous and fingerstick blood samples. The results indicated great detection consistency among samples from fingerstick blood, serum and plasma of venous blood. The IgM-IgG combined assay has better utility and sensitivity compared with a single IgM or IgG test. It can be used for the rapid screening of SARS-CoV-2 carriers, symptomatic or asymptomatic, in hospitals, clinics, and test laboratories. This article is protected by copyright.

The biochemical test showed abnormal increase in related indicators such as interleukin-8, and CT images showed a medical \"white\" lung\". According to the experience of SARS treatment in 2003, the use of hormones will indeed help the patients to alleviate their illness, but patients who survived SARS either had too much hormone at that time and took too long. Although the lungs could recover, but the femoral head was necrotic Either the amount of hormones was very conservative at the time, which kept the lungs in the storm of inflammatory factors, leading to the emergence of irreversible pulmonary fibrosis. So is there a medicine that can anti-inflammatory, reduce the load of hormone use, and have the effect of treating and preventing pulmonary fibrosis complicated by severe viral lung? At present, pirfenidone has achieved encouraging results in the treatment of idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (CTD-ILD) diseases. It is particularly encouraging that the values announced at the 2019 ATS Annual Conference suggest that pirfenidone has more anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects than its own outstanding anti-fibrotic ability. The data shows early use, Its strong anti-SOD activity can effectively inhibit IL-1beta and IL-4, and can open the prevention mode of pulmonary interstitial fibrosis. Based on the above, this project intends to make the following scientific assumptions: based on the homology of the pathogens of the new coronavirus-infected pneumonia and the coronavirus infection of pneumonia in 2003, the similarities in the occurrence and development of the disease, that is, the pulmonary inflammatory storm occurs first, and thereafter The progress of fibrosis and the progressive decline of lung function and mortality are higher than those of ordinary pneumonia. We hope that by adding pirfenidone as a treatment program in addition to standard treatment, it will be a new and severe type of coronavirus infection. Patient clinical treatment provides an effective and practical method.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nThis study is a multi-center, randomized, open, blank-controlled, multi-stage clinical study.

In severe cases, there will be rapid respiratory system failure. The novel coronavirus pneumonia is extremely contagious and the disease progresses rapidly. It has become a urgent and serious public health event that threatens human life and health globally. Among them, severe pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus is characterized by extensive acute inflammation of the lungs and the patient is critically ill. At present, there is no effective treatment in clinical practice.Most of them should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. For severe cases, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions. This clinical trial is to inspect the safety and efficiency of Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells (UC-MSCs) therapy for severe pneumonia patients infected with 2019-nCoV.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nSince December 2019, Wuhan has successively found multiple cases of patients with pneumonia infected by a novel coronavirus. With the spread of the epidemic, other cases in China and abroad have also found such cases. As of 24:00 on February 1, 2020, a total of 14,380 confirmed cases were reported in China, of which there were 2110 severe cases and 304 death cases. At present, there is no effective treatment for pneumonia in the clinic against new coronavirus infection, especially severe and critical cases. Therefore, it is of great significance to explore more active and effective therapeutic approach to severe pneumonia patients infected with 2019-nCoV. Human and animal studies have shown that after infection with coronavirus, the rapid replication of the virus in the body and the subsequent inflammatory response cause damage to alveolar epithelial cells and capillary endothelial cells, causing diffuse interstitial and alveolar edema, and pulmonary function. Impaired, leading to acute hypoxic respiratory insufficiency. The National Health and Medical Commission recently released the \"New Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan (Trial Version 5)\", which pointed out that the new type of coronavirus severe pneumonia usually has difficulty breathing after one week, and the severe cases quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, Septic shock and metabolic acidosis that is difficult to correct. It can be seen that the key to the treatment of new coronavirus severe pneumonia is to inhibit the super-inflammatory immune response caused by the virus, thereby reducing the damage of alveolar epithelial cells and capillary endothelial cells, and then repairing the structure and function of lung tissue. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are one of the most studied and important adult stem cells. A large amount of evidence shows that MSCs can migrate to and return to damaged tissues, exert strong anti-inflammatory and immune regulatory functions, promote the regeneration and repair of damaged tissues, resist apoptosis and inhibit tissue fibrosis, and reduce tissue damage. Many studies have shown that the anti-inflammatory effects of MSCs can significantly reduce virus-induced lung injury and mortality in mice. Studies have shown that MSCs can significantly reduce acute lung injury in mice caused by H9N2 and H5N1 viruses by reducing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and reducing the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the lungs. Compared with MSCs from other sources, human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (umbilical cord MSCs, UC-MSCs) have been widely used because of their convenient collection, no ethical controversy, low immunogenicity, fast self-renewal and strong proliferation ability Research on the treatment of various diseases. Early research in this laboratory used UC-MSCs to intervene in endotoxin (LPS) -induced acute lung injury in mice, and confirmed that UC-MSCs can significantly reduce inflammatory cell infiltration in lung tissue, reduce inflammation in lung tissue, and significantly improve lung The structure and function of tissues protect mouse lung tissue from endotoxin-induced damage. The purpose of this study is to investigate efficiency and safety of UC-MSCs in treating severe pneumonia patients infected with 2019-nCoV. This trial will recruit 48 patients. 24 patients received i.v. transfusion one round (4 times) of 5.0*10E6 cells/kg of UC-MSCs as the treated group, all of them received the conventional treatment. In addition, the equal 24 patients received conventional treatment were used as control group. The respiratory function, pulmonary inflammation, clinical symptoms, pulmonary imaging, side effects, 28-days mortality, immunological characteristics (immune cells, inflammatory factors, etc.) will be evaluated during the 90 days to 96 weeks follow up.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04273646","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

In a short time, Chinese scientists had shared the genome information of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from these pneumonia patients and developed a real-time reverse transcription PCR (real time RT-PCR) diagnostic assay. Whilst the outbreak is likely to have started from a zoonotic transmission event associated with a large seafood market that also traded in live wild animals, it soon became clear that person-to-person transmission was also occurring. The number of cases of infection with 2019-nCoV identified in Wuhan increased markedly over the later part of January 2020, with cases identified in multiple other Provinces of China and internationally. Mathematical models of the expansion phase of the epidemic suggested that sustained person-to-person transmission is occurring, and the R-zero is substantially above 1, the level required for a self-sustaining epidemic in human populations. The clinical spectrum of 2019-nCoV illness appears to be wide, encompassing asymptomatic infection, a mild upper respiratory tract infection, and severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure and even death. Although the per infection risk of severe disease remains to be determined, case-fatality risk of 11-14% has been reported in several initial studies of seriously ill patients and case-fatality has been estimated approximately at 2% overall. Also the large number of cases in Wuhan has resulted in a large number of patients hospitalised with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen and sometimes more advance ventilator support. This new coronavirus, and previous experiences with SARS and MERS-CoV, highlight the need for therapeutics for human coronavirus infections that can improve clinical outcomes, speed recovery, and reduce the requirements for intensive supportive care and prolonged hospitalisation.

There is a lack of effective targeted antiviral drugs, and symptomatic supportive treatment is still the current main treatment for SARI. Vitamin C is significant to human body and plays a role in reducing inflammatory response and preventing common cold. In addtion, a few studies have shown that vitamin C deficiency is related to the increased risk and severity of influenza infections. We hypothize that Vitamin C infusion can help improve the prognosis of patients with SARI. Therefore, it is necessary to study the clinical efficacy and safety of vitamin C for the clinical management of SARI through randomized controlled trials during the current epidemic of SARI.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nAt the end of 2019, patients with unexplained pneumonia appeared in Wuhan, China. At 21:00 on January 7, 2020, a new coronavirus was detected in the laboratory, and the detection of pathogenic nucleic acids was completed at 20:00 on January 10. Subsequently, the World Health Organization officially named the new coronavirus that caused the pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan as 2019 new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and the pneumonia was named severe acute respiratory infection (SARI). Up to February 4, 2020, over 20000 cases have been diagnosed in China, 406 of which have died, and 154 cases have been discovered in other countries around the world. Most of the deaths were elderly patients or patients with severe underlying diseases. SARI has caused global concern and emergency. Statistics of the 41 patients with SARI published in JAMA initially showed that 13 patients were transferred into the ICU, of which 11 (85%) had ARDS and 3 (23%) had shock. Of these, 10 (77%) required mechanical ventilation support, and 2 (15%) required ECMO support. Of the above 13 patients, 5 (38%) eventually died and 7 (38%) were transferred out of the ICU. Viral pneumonia is a dangerous condition with a poor clinical prognosis. For most viral infections, there is a lack of effective targeted antiviral drugs, and symptomatic supportive treatment is still the current main treatment. Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, has antioxidant properties. When sepsis happens, the cytokine surge caused by sepsis is activated, and neutrophils in the lungs accumulate in the lungs, destroying alveolar capillaries. Early clinical studies have shown that vitamin C can effectively prevent this process. In addition, vitamin C can help to eliminate alveolar fluid by preventing the activation and accumulation of neutrophils, and reducing alveolar epithelial water channel damage. At the same time, vitamin C can prevent the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps, which is a biological event of vascular injury caused by neutrophil activation. Vitamins can effectively shorten the duration of the common cold. In extreme conditions (athletes, skiers, art workers, military exercises), it can effectively prevent the common cold. And whether vitamin C also has a certain protective effect on influenza patients, only few studies have shown that vitamin C deficiency is related to the increased risk and severity of influenza infections. In a controlled but non-randomized trial, 85% of the 252 students treated experienced a reduction in symptoms in the high-dose vitamin C group (1g / h at the beginning of symptoms for 6h, followed by 3 * 1g / day). Among patients with sepsis and ARDS, patients in the high-dose vitamin group did not show a better prognosis and other clinical outcomes. There are still some confounding factors in the existing research, and the conclusions are different. Therefore, during the current epidemic of SARI, it is necessary to study the clinical efficacy and safety of vitamin C for viral pneumonia through randomized controlled trials.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04264533","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will actively monitor interim data to make recommendations about early study closure or changes to study arms.\n\nThe initial sample size is projected to be 572 subjects to achieve 400 subjects with a \"recovered\" status (per the primary objective). The primary analysis will be based on those subjects enrolled in order to 400 recoveries. An additional analysis of the moderate severity subgroup (those with baseline status of \"Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen\" or \"Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring ongoing medical care\") is also of public health importance. Hence, enrollment will be permitted until the date of April 20, 2020 to ensure 400 recoveries and provide additional data about this important subgroup. With recent enrollment rates, the total sample size may be 600 to over 800.\n\nSubjects will be assessed daily while hospitalized. If the subjects are discharged from the hospital, they will have a study visit at Days 15, 22, and 29 as an outpatient. For discharged subjects, it is preferred that the Day 15 and 29 visits are in person to obtain safety laboratory tests and OP swab and blood (serum only) samples for secondary research as well as clinical outcome data. However, infection control or other restrictions may limit the ability of the subject to return to the clinic. In this case, Day 15 and 29 visits may be conducted by phone, and only clinical data will be obtained. The Day 22 visit does not have laboratory tests or collection of samples and may also be conducted by phone.\n\nAll subjects will undergo a series of efficacy, safety, and laboratory assessments. Safety laboratory tests and blood (serum and plasma) research samples and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs will be obtained on Days 1 (prior to infusion) and Days 3, 5, 8, and 11 (while hospitalized). OP swabs and blood (serum only) plus safety laboratory tests will be collected on Day 15 and 29 (if the subject attends an in-person visit or are still hospitalized).\n\nThe primary outcome is time to recovery by Day 29. A key secondary outcome evaluates treatment-related improvements in the 8-point ordinal scale at Day 15. As little is known about the clinical course of COVID-19, a pilot study will be used for a blinded sample size reassessment.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04280705","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

In a short time, Chinese scientists had shared the genome information of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from these pneumonia patients and developed a real-time reverse transcription PCR (real time RT-PCR) diagnostic assay. Whilst the outbreak is likely to have started from a zoonotic transmission event associated with a large seafood market that also traded in live wild animals, it soon became clear that person-to-person transmission was also occurring. The number of cases of infection with 2019-nCoV identified in Wuhan increased markedly over the later part of January 2020, with cases identified in multiple other Provinces of China and internationally. Mathematical models of the expansion phase of the epidemic suggested that sustained person-to-person transmission is occurring, and the R-zero is substantially above 1, the level required for a self-sustaining epidemic in human populations. The clinical spectrum of 2019-nCoV infection appears to be wide, encompassing asymptomatic infection, a mild upper respiratory tract illness, and severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure and even death. Although the per infection risk of severe disease remains to be determined, and may differ from the initial reports of 10-15%, the large number of cases in Wuhan has resulted in a large number of patients hospitalised with pneumonia. Progression from prodromal symptoms (usually fever, fatigue, cough) to severe pneumonia requiring supplementary oxygen support, mechanical ventilation, or in some cases ECMO appears to occur most commonly during the second week of illness in association with persistent viral RNA detection. This provides a window of opportunity to test candidate antiviral therapeutics. This new coronavirus, and previous experiences with SARS and MERS-CoV, highlight the need for therapeutics for human coronavirus infections that can improve clinical outcomes, reduce risk of disease progression, speed recovery, and reduce the requirements for intensive supportive care and prolonged hospitalisation. In addition, treatments for mild cases to reduce the duration of illness and infectivity may also be of value were 2019-nCoV to become pandemic and/or endemic in human populations. Given no specific antiviral therapy for 2019-nCoV infection and the availability of remdesvir as a potential antiviral agent based on pre-clinical studies in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, this randomized, controlled, double blind trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of remdesivir in patients hospitalized with mild or moderate 2019-nCoV respiratory disease.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04252664","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

As of 24:00 on January 26, 2020, there are 2744 confirmed cases and 461 severe cases in China, the number is still increasing. There is currently no vaccine and no specific antiviral treatment recommended for 2019-nCoV infection. About 20% of the patients were severe and some died of respiratory failure or multiple organ failure. Therefore, it is urgent to find a safe and effective therapeutic approach to pneumonia patients infected with 2019-nCoV. In the last year, the promising features of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), including their regenerative properties and ability to differentiate into diverse cell lineages, have generated great interest among researchers whose work has offered intriguing perspectives on cell-based therapies for various diseases. These findings seem to highlight that the beneficial effect of MSC-based treatment could be principally due by the immunomodulation and regenerative potential of these cells. The investigators found that infusions of UC-MSC significantly improved liver function in decompensated liver cirrhosis and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) patients, increased the survival rate in acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) patients . MSCs could significantly reduce the pathological changes of lung and inhibit the cell-mediated immune inflammatory response induced by influenza virus in animal model . The purpose of this study is to investigate safety and efficiency of MSCs in treating pneumonia patients infected with 2019-nCoV. This multi-center trial will recruit 20 patients. 10 patients received i.v. transfusion one round (3 times) of 3.0*10E7 cells of MSCs as the treated group, all of them received the conventional treatment. In addition, the equal 10 patients received conventional treatment were used as control.

The symptoms of human infection with SARS-CoV-2 are generally fever, fatigue, dry cough and dyspnea. Noteworthy, a considerable percentage of COVID-19 cases have rapidly progressed to severe and critical type, among which acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the most common complications, resulting in a large number of pneumonia hospitalized patients requiring supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or even ECMO.Pulmonary edema is a detrimental feature as well as a key causal factor of ALI/ARDS. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is considered as the most potent vascular permeability inducers. Recent evidence has revealed higher VEGF levels in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls. The rise of VEGF levels may be caused by hypoxia, severe inflammation, and upregulation of the infected respiratory tract epithelium itself. Numerous studies have confirmed a key role of VEGF as potential therapeutic target in acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due do increase vascular permeability and induce pulmonary edema. Thus, Bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF medication, may offer a unique approach to treat ALI/ARDS caused by COVID-19. Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody with long half-life. It has been approved by the FDA on February 26, 2004 and widely used in clinical oncotherapy, with the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics having been widely understood. Therefore, Bevacizumab is a promising drug for the treatment of ALI/ARDS as well as reduction of mortality in severe and critical COVID-19 patients through suppression of pulmonary edema.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04275414","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no"},

Studies show that in 2017, the number of sepsis patients worldwide reached as high as 48.9 million, of which eleven million patients died. Studies in China also showed that more than one million patients died of sepsis in 2015. Therefore, how to effectively reduce the mortality of patients with sepsis has become a focus of clinical and basic research. Previous studies have suggested that sepsis are often secondary to excessive inflammatory response syndrome. However, treatment measures targeting excessive inflammatory response failed to effectively improve the prognosis of patients. The reason is that sepsis-related immune dysfunction can increase the risk of secondary infection and even affect the fatality rate. The immune checkpoint pathway is the endogenous component of the immune system, which is responsible for checking the immune response and keeping it in a normal physiological state. Tumor cells can evade host recognition through this pathway. One of these immunocheckpoint pathways is the PD-1 and PD-L1 pathways. PD-1 is a receptor expressed on the surface of T cells and ACTS as a negative regulator of T cell function. Monoclonal antibody blocking the activity of PD-1 can successfully reduce tumor load and has been widely used in the clinical treatment of various tumors. The immune imbalance in patients with sepsis has many similarities tumors. PD-1 and PD-L1 are key mediators in T cell depletion in sepsis patients. Animal models have shown that blocking PD-1 or PD-L1 can prevent T cell death, regulate cytokine production, reduce organ dysfunction and reduce death in sepsis. Previous study showed the clinical safety of anti-PD-1 antibody in sepsis patients through randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Thymosin has also been proved to regulate cellular immunity in sepsis patients. Some studies have shown that thymosin can significantly reduce the mortality of sepsis patients. At present, phase III clinical research is in progress to further clarify the role of thymosin in patients with sepsis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of PD-1 and thymosin in patients with severe pneumonia associated with lymphocytopenia in 2019 novel coronavirus infection.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04268537","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

The primary efficacy parameters include the time to oxygen saturation recovery to normal level (≥97%), the proportion of patients with normal level of oxygen saturation after treatment, and the total duration of oxygen inhalation, oxygen flow change by time, oxygen concentration change by time during treatment.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nThe breakout of a new type of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) begun in Wuhan of Hubei province in China in December 2019, and as a result of its rapid spreading nationwide, as of February 16, 2020, a large number of people up to 68,500 totally in China were diagnosed with a new type of disease of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 1665 peoples were died due to this disease in China. Based on the recent epidemiological investigation, the incubation period of this new coronavirus is 1-14 days and 3-7 days for most people before they show any symptom, such as fever, fatigue and dry cough that are the main clinical symptoms a few patients will also show nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat and diarrhea and other symptoms. Severe patients often have dyspnea and/or hypoxemia 1 week after onset of the disease, and the rapid progression for these patients include acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, refractory metabolic acidosis and coagulation dysfunction. According to the \"Guidance of Diagnosis and Treatment for Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Procedural Version 5 Amendment)\" recently issued by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, the general treatment will include close monitoring vital signs and oxygen saturation at finger, additionally, monitoring routine blood test, routine urine test, coagulation function, arterial blood gas analysis based on individual condition, and providing effective oxygen inhalation treatment (including nasal catheter, mask oxygen supply and transnasal high flow oxygen therapy) in time. T89 have the effects of activating blood circulation and removing blood stasis, regulating Qi and relieving pain. Four clinical trials conducted in China and abroad have shown that T89 can effectively alleviate the clinical symptoms of acute high altitude reaction, improve blood oxygen saturation, significantly increase the exercise time in treadmill and metabolic equivalents of task and enhance exercise tolerance under hypoxic environment. Modern pharmacological and gene network-based studies have shown that T89 can improve the oxygen carrying capacity of red blood cells, increase oxygen saturation, effectively reduce the injury of major organs such as heart, brain, lung and kidney caused by hypoxia, and prevent the decrease of oxygen saturation by improving the energy metabolism disorder caused by hypoxia. At the same time, T89 can inhibit the reduction of hematocrit, albumin leakage, neutrophil CD18 and adhesion factor of endothelial cells (ICAM-1), by which T89 has a good therapeutic effect on microcirculation disorders caused by many diseases. In conclusion, T89 can improve the ability of carrying oxygen of red blood cells, increase the oxygen saturation, effectively reduce the injury of heart, brain, lung and kidney and other major organs caused by hypoxia, and it can significantly improve the microcirculation disorder. At the same time, in the \"Guidance for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Atypical Pneumonia (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromes, SARS) P (2003 edition)\" has also recommended T89 can be used as a traditional Chinese patent medicine to treat patients of advanced stage and severe SARS lung asthma syndrome by its effect of promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis. In conclusion, T89 can improve the oxygen saturation and the clinical symptoms of patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), as a result, there may be some benefits for these patients to use T89 in current clinical treatment. This exploratory treatment clinical study is to investigate the effect of T89 on improving oxygen saturation and clinical symptoms in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), with the study design characterized by open-label, randomized and blank-control. In this study, an estimated total of 120-240 male and female patients aged 18-85 years old who have been diagnosed with coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), not including critical type in severity, will be enrolled and randomly assigned to one of two study groups, the T89 treatment group and the blank control group, to receive T89 or nothing for up to 14 days on the base of a standard treatment recommended by the\"Guidance of Diagnosis and Treatment for Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Procedural Version 5 Amendment) .

Statistical analysis See the \"Statistical analysis plan\" for the details of the statistical analysis. The statistician and the principal investigator finalize the plan according to the data characteristics through discussion before the database lock. This protocol only describes the basic statistical analysis content, and the actual content shall be subject to the statistical analysis plan. 2.1Analysis data set 2.1.1Full Analysis Set (FAS): a set of all cases randomized to use the study drug at least once. 2.1.2Per Protocol Set (PPS): a data set generated by subjects who have fully complied with the trial protocol, including treatment received, availability of primary endpoint measurement, and no significant violation of the trial protocol. Cases withdrawn due to inefficacy will also be included in PPS. PPS will be subject to the final classification of the data audit report. 2.1.3Safety Set (SS): a set of subjects who receive at least one treatment with a safety evaluation after randomization. 2.2Missing data processing method 2.2.1The subjects who have missing primary efficiency indicators are filled in according to the treatment failure, that is, the pathogen nucleic acid testing in throat swabs, urine and stool on Days 7-14 after administration does not convert to negative. Unless otherwise specified, the secondary efficiency indicators shall be included as observed data in the statistical analysis, and the missing data shall not be filled in. 2.2.2The safety data shall not be filled in. 2.3Statistical method 2.3.1General principle Description of statistics: The primary indicators collected in this study are described with statistical method. Quantitative indicators are described by means of mean, standard deviation, median, quartile, maximum, minimum and the like; qualitative indicators are described by frequency, percentage and the like. Statistical test: Unless otherwise specified, the statistical significance level is 0.05 by two-sided test (one-sided 0.025) and the 95% confidence interval shall be provided for the estimation of inter-group variance parameters. 2.3.2Characteristics of cases Subject distribution The population and the number of enrolled and completed cases in each center are listed, and three analysis data sets (FAS, PPS, SS) are determined. A detailed list of the data set categories is made. The number and ratio of subjects who are randomly enrolled, complete the trial, and withdraw from the trial early and the reasons are calculated. The subject distribution flow chart is plotted. General information and baseline characteristics The demographic information, previous medication history and history of other diseases of the patients are described with statistical method. General information and baseline characteristics are described based on FAS. 2.3.3Analysis of drug exposure and drug combination Analysis based on SS. The drug exposure, dose intensity and exposure time of each group are calculated and subject to descriptive statistical analysis. The drug combination is coded by WHO ATC and summarized according to the ATC secondary classification and PT. The number and ratio of cases are calculated. 2.3.4Efficiency analysis Analysis based on FAS and PPS. Primary efficiency indicators: The primary effective indicators are complete antipyresis time, pulmonary imaging improvement indicators, and negative conversion ratio of pathogen nucleic acid testing in throat swabs, urine and stool on Days 7-14 after administration.The non-inferiority evaluation is based on FAS. The statistical significance level is set to one-sided 0.025 and the non-inferiority critical value is set to -10%. The negative conversion ratio of pathogen nucleic acid testing in throat swabs, urine and stool on Days 7-14 after administration in the trial group and positive control group is calculated respectively. The negative conversion ratio difference (trial group - control group) between the trial group and positive control group as well as the two-sided 95% confidence interval (95%CI) are calculated. The confidence interval is estimated by Miettinen-Nurminen. If the lower limit of 95% confidence interval for the negative conversion ratio difference between the trial group and control group is greater than -10%, it is considered that the trial drug for the indication is not inferior to the positive control drug. Given that the non-inferiority hypothesis is true, if it is further obtained that the lower limit of 95% confidence interval for the negative conversion ratio difference between the trial group and control group is greater than 0, it is considered that the trial drug for the indication is superior to the positive control drug. The inter-group ratio difference and confidence interval estimation results after the site effect control will be provided simultaneously as the sensitivity analysis and the sites with few subjects may be combined before analysis. Secondary efficiency indicators: The secondary efficiency indicators include negative conversion ratio of pathogen nucleic acid testing on Day 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14 after administration, negative conversion time, immune-related indicators (lymphocyte count, lymphocyte percentage, counts and percentages of CD4 and CD8), SOFA score, white blood cell count and C-reactive protein. The secondary efficiency indicators are subject to descriptive statistical analysis according to the data type. Where, for the quantitative data, the observed values in each visit and the changes in the observed values from baseline after treatment are analyzed descriptively and provided with the inter-group difference estimate value (trial group - control group) of the changes in indicators in different visits from baseline and its 95% confidence interval; for the qualitative data, the indicators in different visits are described in the form of a frequency table (frequency and percentage) and provided with the inter-group ratio difference and confidence interval estimate; for the survival data, such as the negative conversion time of pathogen nucleic acid testing and complete antipyresis time, the median complete antipyresis time and its 95% confidence interval in each group are calculated by Kaplan-Meier, the information on the subject deletions at the end of the study is provided and the survivorship curve is provided.

This clinical trial is to inspect the safety and efficiency of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) therapy for severe COVID-19.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nThe epidemic of 2019 novel coronavirus (causing the disease Covid-19) has expanded from Wuhan throughout China and is being exported to a growing number of countries, some of which have seen onward transmission. COVID-19 caused clusters of severe respiratory illness and was associated with 2% mortality. There is currently no vaccine and no specific antiviral treatment recommended for COVID-19. About 20% of the patients were severe and the mainstay of clinical management is largely symptomatic treatment, with organ support in intensive care for seriously ill patients. Therefore, it is urgent to find a safe and effective therapeutic approach to COVID-19. In the last years, the promising features of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), including their regenerative properties and ability to differentiate into diverse cell lineages, have generated great interest among researchers whose work has offered intriguing perspectives on cell-based therapies for various diseases. These findings seem to highlight that the beneficial effect of MSC-based treatment could be principally due by the immunomodulation and regenerative potential of these cells. MSCs could significantly reduce the pathological changes of lung and inhibit the cell-mediated immune inflammatory response induced by influenza virus in animal model . MSCs has been shown to reduce nonproductive inflammation and affect tissue regeneration and is being evaluated in patients with ARDS. Our phase I preliminary data of parallel assignment study(NCT04252118) showed that three doses of MSCs was safe in patients with COVID-19. Randomized control trial are needed to assess efficacy and safety. The investigators will do a prospective, double-blind, multicentre, randomised trial to assess treatment with three intravenous doses of MSCs compared with placebo. 90 severe COVID-19 patients will be recruited in China. 60 patients receive i.v. transfusion 3 times of MSCs（ 4.0*10E7 cells per time), as the treated group, all of them receive the conventional treatment.

Conventional medical therapy, including intensive care and respiratory support is associated with a 35%-50% mortality. Aviptadil, a synthetic form of Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP) has been awarded FDA Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of ARDS. Nonclinical studies demonstrate that VIP is highly concentrated in the lung, where it prevents NMDA-induced caspase-3 activation in the lung, inhibits IL6 and TNFa production, protects against HCl-induced pulmonary edema, These and other effects have been observed in numerous animal model systems of lung injury in mice, rats, guinea pigs, sheep, swine, and dogs. In these models, Aviptadil restores barrier function at the endothelial/alveolar interface and thereby protects the lung and other organs from failure. Aviptadil is approved for human use in Europe and has a demonstrated 20 year history of safety in numerous trials for Sarcoid, Pulmonary Fibrosis, Bronchospasm, Erectile Dysfunction, and a phase I trial in ARDS. Five phase 2 trials have been conducted under European regulatory authority. Numerous healthy volunteer studies have shown that i.v. infusion of Aviptadil is well tolerated with few adverse effects including alterations in blood pressure, heart rate, or ECG. In addition to published studies of human use, Aviptadil has been used on a compounded basis in certain ICUs for many years in the belief that it preserves life and restores function in pulmonary hypertension, ARDS, and Acute Lung Injury (ALI). In this study, patients who are hospitalized and intubated for ARDS secondary to COVID-19 infection will be randomly allocated to Aviptadil administered by intravenous infusion, nebulization via the endotracheal tube, and both IV and endotracheal administration.

SARS-CoV-2 is a RNA virus that display high similarity in both genomic and proteomic profiling with SARS-CoV that first emerged in humans in 2003 in China. Therefore, preventing and controlling the pandemic occurrences are extremely urgent as a global top priority. Due to the lack of effective antiviral drugs, patients may be treated by only addressing their symptoms such as reducing fever. Clinical autopsies from SARS-CoV-infected patients demonstrated that there were major pathological changes in the lungs, immune organs, and small systemic blood vessels with vasculitis. However, the detection of SARS-CoV were primarily found in the lung and trachea/bronchus, but was undetectable in spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow, heart and aorta, highlighting the overreaction of immune responses induced by viral infection were really harmful, resulting in the pathogenesis of lungs, immune organs, and small systemic blood vessels. To this respect, immune modulation strategy may be potentially beneficial to enhance anti-viral immunity and efficiently reduce the viral load, improve clinical outcomes, expedite the patient recovery, and decline the rate of mortality in patients after being infected with SARS-CoV-2. Tianhe Stem Cell Biotechnologies Inc. has developed a novel globally-patented Stem Cell Educator (SCE) technology designed to reverse the autoimmune response in Type 1 diabetes (T1D), Alopecia Areata (AA) and other autoimmune diseases. SCE therapy uses human multipotent cord blood stem cells (CB-SC) from human cord blood. Their properties distinguish CB-SC from other known stem cell types, including mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Several clinical studies show that SCE therapy functions via CB-SC induction of immune tolerance in autoimmune T cells and restore immune balance and homeostasis in patients with T1D, AA and other inflammation-associated diseases. To correct the overreaction of overreaction of immune responses, the investigators plan to treat SARS-CoV-2 patients with Stem Cell Educator therapy.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nThis is a prospective, two-arm, partially masked, single center clinical study to assess the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of SCE therapy for the treatment of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Subjects who meet all criteria will be scheduled for treatment. All enrolled subjects will receive one treatment with the SCE therapy consisting of a single session of mononuclear cells (MNC) collection by apheresis of blood.

Some patients rapidly progressed and suffered severe acute respiratory failure and died, making it imperative to develop a safe and effective vaccine to treat and prevent severe Covid-19 pneumonia. Based on detailed analysis of the viral genome and search for potential immunogenic targets, a synthetic minigene has been engineered based on conserved domains of the viral structural proteins and a polyprotein protease. The infection of Covid-19 is mediated through binding of the Spike protein to the ACEII receptor, and the viral replication depends on molecular mechanisms of all of these viral proteins. This trial proposes to develop universal vaccine and test innovative Covid-19 minigenes engineered based on multiple viral genes, using an efficient lentiviral vector system (NHP/TYF) to express viral proteins and immune modulatory genes to modify artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPC) and to activate T cells. In this study, the safety and immune reactivity of this aAPC vaccine will be investigated.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nBackground: The 2019 discovered new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is an enveloped positive strand single strand RNA virus. The number of SARS-CoV-2 infected people has increased rapidly and WHO has warned that the pandemic spread of Covid-19 is imminent and would have disastrous outcomes. Covid-19 could pose a serious threat to human health and the global economy. There is no vaccine available or clinically approved antiviral therapy as yet. This study aims to evaluate the safety and immune reactivity of a genetically modified aAPC universal vaccine to treat and prevent Covid-19. Objective: Primary study objectives: Injection of Covid-19/aAPC vaccine to volunteers to evaluate the safety. Secondary study objectives: To evaluate the anti- Covid-19 reactivity of the Covid-19/aAPC vaccine. Design: 1. Based on the genomic sequence of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, select conserved and critical structural and protease protein domains to engineer lentiviral minigenes to express SARS-CoV-2 antigens. 2. The Covid-19/aAPC vaccine is prepared by applying lentivirus modification including immune modulatory genes and the viral minigenes, to the artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPCs). The Covid-19/aAPCs are then inactivated for proliferation and extensively safety tested. 3. The subjects receive a total of 5x10^ 6 cells each time by subcutaneous injection at 0, 14 and 28 days. The subjects are followed-up with peripheral blood tests at 0, 14, 21, 28 and 60 days until the end of the test.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04299724","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

At present, there are no proven interventions to prevent progression of the disease. Some preliminary data on SARS pneumonia suggest that inhaled Nitric Oxide (NO) could have beneficial effects on SARS-CoV-2 due to the genomic similarities between this two coronaviruses. In this study we will test whether inhaled NO therapy prevents progression in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 disease.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nTo date, no targeted therapeutic treatments for the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak have been identified. Antiviral combined with adjuvant therapies are currently under investigation. The clinical spectrum of the infection is wide, ranging from mild signs of upper respiratory tract infection to severe pneumonia and death. In the patients who progress, the time period from symptoms onset to development of dyspnea is reported to be between 5 to 10 days, and that one to severe respiratory distress syndrome from 10 to 14 days. Globally, 15 to 18% of patients deteriorates to the need of mechanical ventilation, despite the use of non-invasive ventilatory support in the earliest phases of the disease. Probability of progression to end stage disease is unpredictable, with the majority of these patients dying from multi-organ failure. Preventing progression in spontaneously breathing patients with mild to moderate disease would translate in improved morbidity and mortality and in a lower use of limited healthcare resources. In 2004, during the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak, a pilot study showed that low dose ( max 30 ppm) inhaled NO for 3 days was able to shorten the time of ventilatory support. At the same time, NO donor compound S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine increased survival rate in an in-vitro model of SARS-CoV infected epithelial cells.Based on the genetic similarities between the two viruses, similar effects of NO on SARS-CoV-2 can be hypothesized. While further in-vitro testing is recommended, we proposed a randomized clinical trial to test the effectiveness of inhaled NO in preventing the progression of SARS-CoV-2 related disease, when administered at an early stage.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04305457","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

No proven vaccine is available to protect healthcare workers against SARS-CoV-2. This study will enroll 260 healthcare professionals dedicated to care for patients with proven SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subjects will be randomized either in the observational (control) group or in the inhaled nitric oxide group. All personnel will observe measures on strict precaution in accordance with WHO and the CDC regulations.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nIn their efforts to provide care for patients with novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) infection, many healthcare workers around the globe exposed to SARS-CoV-2 got infected and died over the past two months. Quarantined nurses and physicians have become the norm in regions with COVID-19 patients, putting at risk the overall functionality of the regional healthcare system. Other than strict contact-precautions, no proven vaccination or targeted therapy is available to prevent COVID-19 in healthcare workers. Inhaled nitric oxide gas (NO) has shown in a small clinical study to have antiviral activity against a Coronavirus during the 2003 SARS outbreak. We have designed this study to assess whether intermittent inhaled NO in healthcare workers might prevent their infection with SARS-CoV-2. Background: After almost two months of fight against COVID-19 infection, on February 24, more than 3,000 physicians and nurses were reported as contracting COVID-19 disease in Wuhan (China). Fatalities among those healthcare workers were reported to be related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Implementation of strict contact protections for all healthcare personnel is essential to decrease and contain the risks of exposure. However, despite best efforts, dozens of thousands of healthcare providers have been quarantined for at least 14 consecutive days in Wuhan alone. Similarly data have been reported in Italy, several healthcare providers have been quarantined, developed pneumonia and died. Most recent information from Italy reported that 12% of healthcare workers are infected. The shortage of hospital personnel, especially in the critical care and anesthesiology domains, led many hospitals to postpone indefinitely scheduled surgical procedures, including cardiac surgery or oncological procedures. Only urgent and emergent cases are performed in patients without symptoms (i.e., absence of fever, cough or dyspnea), no signs (i.e., negative chest CT for consolidations, normal complete blood count) and a negative test on SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase (rt)-PCR. If time does not allow for thorough screening (i.e., after traumatic injury), such patients are considered to be infected and medical staff in the OR are fully protected with third degree protections (i.e., N95 masks, goggles, protective garments and a gown and double gloving). Rationale. In 2004 in a collaborative study between the virology laboratory at the University of Leuven (Belgium), the Clinical Physiology Laboratory of Uppsala University (Sweden) and the General Airforce Hospital of China (Beijing, China), nitric oxide (NO) donors (e.g. S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine) greatly increased the survival rate of infected eukaryotic cells with the coronavirus responsible for SARS (SARS-CoV-1), suggesting direct antiviral effects of NO. These authors suggest that oxidation is the antiviral mechanism of nitric oxide. A later work by Akerstrom and colleagues showed that NO or its derivatives reduce palmitoylation SARS-CoV spike (S) protein affecting its fusion with angiotensin converting enzyme 2. Furthermore, NO or its derivatives reduce viral RNA synthesis in the infected cells. Future in-vitro studies should confirm that NO donors are equally effective against SARS-CoV-2, as the current virus shares 88% of its genome with the SARS-CoV [3]. However, at present it is reasonable to assess that a high dose of inhaled NO might be anti-viral against SARS-CoV-2 in the lung. The virus is transmitted by human-to-human contact and occurs primarily via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes within a range of about 1.5 meters. The incubation period ranges from 1 to 14 days with an estimated median incubation period of 5 to 6 days according to the World Health Organization [1]. COVID-19 disease is mainly a respiratory system disease, but in the most severe forms can progress to impair also other organ function (i.e., kidneys, liver, heart). Nitric oxide gas inhalation has been successfully and safely used for decades (since 1990) in thousands of newborns and adults to decrease pulmonary artery pressure and improve systemic oxygenation. Recently at the Massachusetts General Hospital, a high dose of inhaled NO (160 ppm) for 30 - 60 minutes was delivered twice a day to an adolescent with cystic fibrosis and pulmonary infection due to multi-resistant Burkholderia cepacia. There were no adverse events to this patient, blood methemoglobin remained below 5% and lung function and overall well-being improved. Clinical Gap. Thousands of healthcare workers have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and contracted COVID-19 despite their best efforts to prevent contamination. No proven vaccine is available to protect healthcare workers against SARS-CoV-2. Hypothesis. Due to genetic similarities with the Coronavirus responsible for SARS, it is expected that inhaled NO gas retains potent antiviral activity against the SARS-CoV-2 responsible for COVID-19. Aim. To assess whether intermittent delivery of inhaled NO gas in air at a high dose may protect healthcare workers from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Observational group: a SARS-CoV-2 rt-PCR will be performed once a week. Treatment group: the subjects will breathe NO at 160 parts per million (ppm) for two cycles of 15 minutes each at the beginning of each shift and before leaving the hospital. A SARS-CoV-2 rt-PCR will be performed once a week. Safety: Oxygenation and methemoglobin levels will be monitored via a non-invasive CO-oximeter. If methemoglobin levels rise above 5% at any point of the gas delivery, inhaled NO will be stopped. NO2 gas will be monitored and maintained below 5 ppm. Blinding. The treatment is not masked.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04312243","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to standard of care or standard of care with the addition of therapy with chloroquine.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nChloroquine is one of two therapeutics (in addition to remdesivir) that has demonstrated in vitro inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2 and the drug is immediately available from national pharmacies. No delay is accordingly expected in treatment initiation after study commencement. In light of the evidence supporting chloroquine as a promising therapeutic in patients with COVID-19, the expected impact of the current proposal is considerable both in the short- and long-term. If successful, treatment with chloroquine has the potential to be the first evidence based treatment for COVID-19. The drug is affordable and the risk of side effects is low, making it an attractive therapeutic in large proportions of the population on a global scale. In the current proposal aims to investigate the virological and clinical effects of chloroquine treatment in patients with established SARS-CoV-2 in need of hospital admission. The investigators hypothesize that early treatment with chloroquine in patients with established COVID-19 is safe and will significantly improve prognosis and impact clinical outcomes. More specifically, the investigators hypothesize that early treatment with chloroquine will increase the virological clearance rate of SARS-CoV-2, and lead to more rapid resolve of clinical symptoms, decreased proportion of patients with clinical deterioration and a decreased admission rate to intensive care units and in-hospital mortality. Considering the immediate and worldwide health emergency associated with the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and the current lack of evidence based medical interventions for this patient group, studies investigating such possible treatment modalities in COVID-19 are direly needed. The study is a two-arm, open label, pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to assess the virological and clinical effect of chloroquine therapy in patients with established COVID-19. Pragmatic clinical trials are characterized by focus on informing decision-makers on optimal clinical medicine practice and an intent to streamline procedures and data collection in the trial. By utilizing resources already paid for by the hospitals (physicians and nurses in daily clinical practice), pragmatic clinical trials can include a larger number of patients at a short time duration and at a lower cost. Due to the immediate need for study commencement and the time frame of the current proposal, a pragmatic approach will enable swift initiation of randomization and treatment. Data will be extracted from the data warehouse at Akershus University Hospital for eligible patient identification (i.e. electronic surveillance) and for automatic data extraction to the study specific database. The study will not be able to procure an acceptable placebo treatment and the study will accordingly not be placebo-controlled. All patients at Akershus University Hospital with suspicion of acute respiratory tract infections are examined with a nasopharyngeal swab, with subsequent microbiological examination, including SARS-CoV-2 specific RT-PCR. Participants will be recruited from the entirety of the inpatients at the participating hospitals. Electronic real-time surveillance of laboratory reports from the Department of Microbiology will be examined regularly, with maximum interval 24 hours, for SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects. The study aims to include patients by a sequential adaptive approach, where analyses are planned after the inclusion of 51 patients, with subsequent analyses after 101, 151 and 202 completed patients. All patients included in each sequence will be used for the final analyses of the entire study. This approach will enable frequent assessment of all outcome measures. Data will be collected from the hospital electronic record system, including electronic patient records, laboratory and medical imaging systems, and prescribing systems. The data warehouse at Akershus University Hospital will be utilized for automatic data extraction to the study specific database. All clinical variables will be registered in the study eCRF system, including clinical endpoints and quantitative virological results from serial nasopharyngeal specimens.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04316377","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},

The novel coronavirus attacks the human body by attaching to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), a protective enzyme against lung damage. In addition, the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 for HCoV-19 Spike protein priming is also essential for the host cell entry and spread. Coronaviruses can be deadly, in large part because they cause \"cytokine storms.\" These storms result from imbalances between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory proteins called cytokines, which can cause extreme inflammation and respiratory complications. Respiratory distress kills hundreds of thousands of people each year worldwide, and hundreds of clinical trials are testing drugs to treat it. MSCs have been widely used in cell-based therapy, from basic research to clinical trials Safety and effectiveness have been clearly documented in many clinical trials, especially in the immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. NestCell® is a mesenchymal stem cell therapy produced by Cellavita and proved to be safe in previous clinical trials. The aim of this study is assess the efficacy of NestCell® as an add-on therapy to standard treatment to treat patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

All subjects will be treated with the best available treatment. The follow up period is 15 days.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nAs the newest global medical emergency, the COVID-19 (diagnosed SARS-CoV2 infection with lung involvement) exhibits features that are unlikely ameliorated by antivirals-based approaches alone. First, although the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infect lung and intestine, many patients suddenly take a turn for the worse even when the viral replication appears to be under control. Second, patients with serious or critical clinical symptoms show remarked T cell lymphopenia that are more severe and more acute than human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Functional exhaustion of T cells is suggested by high expression of T-cell exhaustion markers, which again appears more acute than in HIV patients. Third, multiple cytokines are elevated among patients with severe clinical symptoms, which potentially explains the multiple organ failure associated with COVID-19. For these reasons, treatment of COVID-19 likely requires a combination of both antivirals and non-antivirals-based approaches. CD24Fc is a biological immunomodulator in Phase II/III clinical trial stage. CD24Fc comprises the nonpolymorphic regions of CD24 attached to the Fc region of human IgG1. We have shown that CD24 is an innate checkpoint against the inflammatory response to tissue injuries or danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that CD24Fc effectively address the major challenges associated with COVID-19. First, a Phase I clinical trial on healthy volunteers not only demonstrated safety of CD24Fc, but also demonstrated its biological activity in suppressing expression of multiple inflammatory cytokines. Second, in Phase II clinical trial in leukemia patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT), three doses of CD24Fc effectively eliminated severe (Grade 3-4) acute graft vs host diseases (GVHD), which is caused by over reacting immune system and transplanted T cells attacking recipient target tissues. Third, in preclinical models of HIV/SIV infections, we have shown that CD24Fc ameliorated production of multiple inflammatory cytokines, reversed the loss of T lymphocytes as well as functional T cell exhaustion and reduced the leukocyte infiltration of multiple organs. It is particularly noteworthy that CD24Fc reduced the rate of pneumonia in SIV-infected Chinese rhesus monkey from 83% to 33%. Therefore, CD24Fc maybe a prime candidate for non-antiviral biological modifier for COVID-19 therapy. The phase III trial will involve 230 patients randomized into blinded placebo and CD24Fc arms, with time to clinical improvement from severe to mild symptom as the primary endpoint.","entry_type":"registration","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04317040","is_covid":"yes","is_trial":"yes","is_observational":"no","is_duplicate":false},
