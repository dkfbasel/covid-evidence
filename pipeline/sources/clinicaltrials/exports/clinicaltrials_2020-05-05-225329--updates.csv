clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04342689;detailed_description;"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a substantial strain on the healthcare system, with at least 14% of infected patients requiring hospitalization. Identifying ways to ameliorate the progression and severity of the COVID-19 infection and preventing hospitalization is critical.

Patients suffering from COVID-19 have been shown to have a significant inflammatory response resembling that of cytokine release syndrome, and it is this inflammatory phase that is thought to drive fatality. IL-6 has been shown to be one of the most commonly elevated inflammatory markers in COVID-19 patients, and Tocilizumab, an IL-6 inhibitor, has been used to ameliorate this exaggerated inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients. However, this is used mainly in already hospitalized patients who show signs of increased inflammation, and more research is needed on interventions that slow the onset of inflammation and decrease subsequent hospitalization of infected individuals.

Resistant potato starch (RPS) has been shown to decrease IL-6 in humans, partly through its ability to increase butyrate levels. Butyrate not only reduces IL-6 production and overall inflammation, but also has been shown to specifically decrease lung inflammation in animal models through cytokine suppression. Further, it may reduce ACE2 receptor expression, which is the main entry mechanism for COVID-19 into epithelial lung cells. Increased butyrate in the intestinal microbiome is also associated with less viral lower respiratory tract infections in allo- HCT recipients. Our preliminary data shows an increase in butyrate levels in participants' stool within one week of RPS therapy (20 grams twice daily) with no noticeable side effect.

To this end, we have designed a multicenter randomized clinical trial to determine the efficacy of resistant potato starch in reducing the need for hospitalization for COVID-19 positive patients. We will enroll 1300 non-hospitalized COVID-19 positive individuals who are being monitored in the outpatient setting. Patients will be randomized to either receive RPS therapy (2 tablespoons (~ 20 grams) of RPS twice daily) or a placebo (2 tablespoons of non-resistant, digestible starch twice daily) , each for 14 days. Our primary outcome is the rate of hospitalization for COVID-19 related complications. Secondary outcomes will look at time to recovery and symptom severity scores.";"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a substantial strain on the healthcare system, with at least 14% of infected patients requiring hospitalization.

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04312243;detailed_description;In their efforts to provide care for patients with novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) infection, many healthcare workers around the globe exposed to SARS-CoV-2 got infected and died over the past two months. Quarantined nurses and physicians have become the norm in regions with COVID-19 patients, putting at risk the overall functionality of the regional healthcare system. Other than strict contact-precautions, no proven vaccination or targeted therapy is available to prevent COVID-19 in healthcare workers. Inhaled nitric oxide gas (NO) has shown in a small clinical study to have antiviral activity against a Coronavirus during the 2003 SARS outbreak. We have designed this study to assess whether intermittent inhaled NO in healthcare workers might prevent their infection with SARS-CoV-2. Background: After almost two months of fight against COVID-19 infection, on February 24, more than 3,000 physicians and nurses were reported as contracting COVID-19 disease in Wuhan (China). Fatalities among those healthcare workers were reported to be related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Implementation of strict contact protections for all healthcare personnel is essential to decrease and contain the risks of exposure. However, despite best efforts, dozens of thousands of healthcare providers have been quarantined for at least 14 consecutive days in Wuhan alone. Similarly data have been reported in Italy, several healthcare providers have been quarantined, developed pneumonia and died. Most recent information from Italy reported that 12% of healthcare workers are infected. The shortage of hospital personnel, especially in the critical care and anesthesiology domains, led many hospitals to postpone indefinitely scheduled surgical procedures, including cardiac surgery or oncological procedures. Only urgent and emergent cases are performed in patients without symptoms (i.e., absence of fever, cough or dyspnea), no signs (i.e., negative chest CT for consolidations, normal complete blood count) and a negative test on SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase (rt)-PCR. If time does not allow for thorough screening (i.e., after traumatic injury), such patients are considered to be infected and medical staff in the OR are fully protected with third degree protections (i.e., N95 masks, goggles, protective garments and a gown and double gloving). Rationale. In 2004 in a collaborative study between the virology laboratory at the University of Leuven (Belgium), the Clinical Physiology Laboratory of Uppsala University (Sweden) and the General Airforce Hospital of China (Beijing, China), nitric oxide (NO) donors (e.g. S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine) greatly increased the survival rate of infected eukaryotic cells with the coronavirus responsible for SARS (SARS-CoV-1), suggesting direct antiviral effects of NO. These authors suggest that oxidation is the antiviral mechanism of nitric oxide. A later work by Akerstrom and colleagues showed that NO or its derivatives reduce palmitoylation SARS-CoV spike (S) protein affecting its fusion with angiotensin converting enzyme 2. Furthermore, NO or its derivatives reduce viral RNA synthesis in the infected cells. Future in-vitro studies should confirm that NO donors are equally effective against SARS-CoV-2, as the current virus shares 88% of its genome with the SARS-CoV [3]. However, at present it is reasonable to assess that a high dose of inhaled NO might be anti-viral against SARS-CoV-2 in the lung. The virus is transmitted by human-to-human contact and occurs primarily via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes within a range of about 1.5 meters. The incubation period ranges from 1 to 14 days with an estimated median incubation period of 5 to 6 days according to the World Health Organization [1]. COVID-19 disease is mainly a respiratory system disease, but in the most severe forms can progress to impair also other organ function (i.e., kidneys, liver, heart). Nitric oxide gas inhalation has been successfully and safely used for decades (since 1990) in thousands of newborns and adults to decrease pulmonary artery pressure and improve systemic oxygenation. Recently at the Massachusetts General Hospital, a high dose of inhaled NO (160 ppm) for 30 - 60 minutes was delivered twice a day to an adolescent with cystic fibrosis and pulmonary infection due to multi-resistant Burkholderia cepacia. There were no adverse events to this patient, blood methemoglobin remained below 5% and lung function and overall well-being improved. Clinical Gap. Thousands of healthcare workers have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and contracted COVID-19 despite their best efforts to prevent contamination. No proven vaccine is available to protect healthcare workers against SARS-CoV-2. Hypothesis. Due to genetic similarities with the Coronavirus responsible for SARS, it is expected that inhaled NO gas retains potent antiviral activity against the SARS-CoV-2 responsible for COVID-19. Aim. To assess whether intermittent delivery of inhaled NO gas in air at a high dose may protect healthcare workers from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Observational group: a SARS-CoV-2 rt-PCR will be performed once a week. Treatment group: the subjects will breathe NO at 160 parts per million (ppm) for two cycles of 15 minutes each at the beginning of each shift and before leaving the hospital. A SARS-CoV-2 rt-PCR will be performed once a week. Safety: Oxygenation and methemoglobin levels will be monitored via a non-invasive CO-oximeter. If methemoglobin levels rise above 5% at any point of the gas delivery, inhaled NO will be stopped. NO2 gas will be monitored and maintained below 5 ppm. Blinding.

China's guidelines were set up in January 2020 and treated hospitalized patients with lopinavir/ritonavir, either alone or with various combinations. Darunavir (DRV)/Cobicistat, is also a protease inhibitor used to treat and prevent HIV/AIDS. Its as effective as lopinavir/ritonavir for the treatment of HIV/AIDS and better tolerated because the adverse effects rate is lower (diarrhea 2% vs 27%). Another promising drug is chloroquine, that showed excellent in vitro results and strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV infection of primate cells. Results from n=100 patients have shown superiority to the control treatment in improving lung imaging findings, promoting virus reversion to negative and shortening the disease.;"Previous research on influenza has indicated that antiviral drugs administered before o short after symptom onset can reduce infectiousness to others by reducing viral loads in the respiratory secretions of patients.

In last week DRV has been shown to exert no activity on the SARS-CoV-2 clinical studies and is therefore withdrawn for futility. Although LPVr shows in vitro efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 at elevated total drug concentrations, human clinical trials have not demonstrated superiority of LPVr vs Placebo. It has been considered that the magnitude of the possible clinical benefit of LPVr if it is started in the early stages of the disease is small and does not compensate for the gastrointestinal and renal toxicity of the drug.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a drug that has been extensively used for the prevention of malaria. HCQ showed excellent in vitro results and strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection of primate cells at low concentration."

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04337918;detailed_description;"The novel, human-infecting corona-virus, provisionally named 2019 novel corona virus (2019-nCoV) is a single-strand, positive-sense RNA virus and has a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The virus is transmitted via airborne droplets to the nasal mucosa. Replication occurs locally in the nasal mucosa, in ciliated epithelial cells, over a 3-day incubation period. The mucosal cells are damaged with a resultant inflammatory response similar to the common cold. During this time the virus is shed in nasal secretions causing disease in the lower respiratory tract, potentially causing fatal viral pneumonia.

The literature supports that NO or its derivatives have inhibitory effects on a variety of viral infections. This inhibitory effect was shown to be marked in Interferon (IFN) mediated inhibition manifested by activated macrophage. It was also shown to be correlated with s-nitrosylation of viral proteins such as reductases and proteases.

Based on the genetic similarities between SARS and corona viruses, similar viricidal effects of NO on COVID-19 can be hypothesized.

SaNOtize has developed an innovative approach to provide nitric oxide gas using a formulation called Nitric Oxide Releasing Solution (NORS). This patented solution releases virucidal doses of NO for a sustained period (at least 30 min) against Influenza A.

NORS delivered as a gargle (AM), nasal spray (PRN) or as a nasopharyngeal flush (PM) has the potential to decontaminate the upper respiratory tract that could preventing transmission and progression of COVID-19 in Healthcare Workers & Individuals at Risk of Infection.

The randomized Prevention study will investigate the ability of NORS to prevent COVID-19 infection when used prophylactically. The open-label Treatment Sub-Study is expected to be small and will provide pilot data on the possibility of NORS as a treatment for Mild/Moderate COVID-19 infection.";"The novel, human-infecting corona-virus, provisionally named 2019 novel corona virus (2019-nCoV) is a single-strand, positive-sense RNA virus and has a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

During this time the virus is shed in nasal secretions causing disease in the lower respiratory tract, potentially causing fatal viral pneumonia.

The literature supports that NO or its derivatives have inhibitory effects on a variety of viral infections. This inhibitory effect was shown to be marked in Interferon (IFN) mediated inhibition manifested by activated macrophage. It was also shown to be correlated with s-nitrosylation of viral proteins such as reductases and proteases.

Based on the genetic similarities between SARS and corona viruses, similar viricidal effects of NO on COVID-19 can be hypothesized.

SaNOtize has developed an innovative approach to provide nitric oxide gas using a formulation called Nitric Oxide Releasing Solution (NORS). This patented solution releases virucidal doses of NO for a sustained period and is effective at rapidly inactivating Influenza A and SARS-CoV-2.

NORS delivered as a gargle (AM), nasal spray (PRN) or as a nasopharyngeal flush (PM) has the potential to decontaminate the upper respiratory tract that could preventing transmission and progression of COVID-19 in Healthcare Workers & Individuals at Risk of Infection.

The randomized Prevention study will investigate the ability of NORS to prevent COVID-19 infection when used prophylactically. The open-label Treatment Sub-Study is expected to be small and will provide pilot data on the possibility of NORS as a treatment for Mild/Moderate COVID-19 infection."

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04348656;detailed_description;"Problem to be addressed: In December 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Committee (Wuhan, China) identified an outbreak of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause. Coronavirus RNA was quickly identified in some of these patients.This novel coronavirus has been designated SARS-CoV-2, and the disease caused by this virus has been designated COVID-19.Outbreak forecasting and mathematical modelling suggest that these numbers will continue to rise [1] in many countries over the coming weeks to months.Global efforts to evaluate novel antivirals and therapeutic strategies to treat COVID-19 have intensified. There is an urgent public health need for rapid development of novel interventions. At present, there is no specific antiviral therapy for coronavirus infections.

Passive immunization: Passive antibody therapy involves the administration of antibodies to a given agent to a susceptible individual for the purpose of preventing or treating an infectious disease due to that agent. In contrast, active vaccination requires the induction of an immune response that takes time to develop and varies depending on the vaccine recipient. Some immunocompromised patients fail to achieve an adequate immune response. Thus, passive antibody administration is the only means of providing immediate immunity to susceptible persons and immunity of any measurable kind for highly immunocompromised patients. The only antibody type that is currently available for immediate use is that found in human convalescent plasma.The American Food and Drug Agency (FDA) has recently announced clinical trials and a facilitated access to COVID-19 convalescent plasma for use is patients with severe or life-threatening infections [2].

Known potential risks and benefits: There is a theoretical risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE) through which virus targeted by non-neutralizing antibodies gain entry into macrophages. Another theoretical risk is that antibody administration to those exposed to SARS-CoV-2 may avoid disease but modify the immune response such that those individuals mount attenuated immune responses, which would leave them vulnerable to subsequent re-infection. Finally, there are risks associated with any transfusion of plasma including transmission of blood transmitted viruses (e.g. HIV, HBV, HCV, etc.), allergic transfusion reactions, including anaphylaxis, febrile non hemolytic transfusion reaction, transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI), transfusion associated cardiac overload (TACO), and hemolysis should ABO incompatible plasma be administered. Potential benefits of COVID-19 convalescent plasma include improved survival, improvement in symptoms, decreased risk in intubation for mechanical ventilation, decrease risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, shortened hospitalization time and suppression of viral load.

Mechanism of action: Transfusion of apheresis frozen plasma (AFP) from COVID-19 convalescent patients allows the transfer of donor neutralizing antibodies directed against SARS-CoV2 antigens to the recipient, thus allowing the generation of passive immunization. Naturally produced human antibody are polyclonal, meaning they are directed against a variety of different viral antigens and epitopes allowing for a general neutralizing effect against the virus rather than focussing on a specific target. Administration of convalescent plasma has been associated with rapid decrease in viral load. It is also possible that passive immunization contributes to improved cell-mediated immunity by favoring the phagocytosis and presentation of viral antigens to host T cells.

Participant recruitment:Only hospitalized COVID-19 patients are eligible so recruitment efforts will be focused on identified consecutive patients admitted to hospital with acute COVID-19 infection. No other external recruitment efforts are planned. At each participating hospital, a process for identifying patients with COVID-19 will be established.

Donor recruitment: Recovered COVID-19 patients will be identified as potential donors in collaboration with provincial public health services, local health authorities, and individual co-investigators involved in the study. Potential donors may also be recruiting following self-identification on the routine donor questionnaire or through social media. They will be contacted by phone and invited to participate in the program as potential donors. After obtaining verbal consent and reviewing donor selection criteria, eligible participants will be directed to a Héma-Québec collection or Canadian Blood Services apheresis collection site in their area to donate.

Criteria for donors: All donors will need to meet the criteria set forth in the Manual of donor selection criteria in use at Héma-Québec or Canadian Blood ServicesIn addition, donors will require:

Prior diagnosis of COVID-19 documented by a PCR test at time of infection or by positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology following infection
Complete resolution of symptoms
A delay of at least 14 days since resolution of COVID-19 symptoms
Male donors, or female donors with no pregnancy history or with negative anti-HLA antibodies
At least 6 days since last plasma donation
Provided informed consent

Randomization procedures: Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio (convalescent plasma vs standard of care). Patients will be randomized using a secure, concealed, computer-generated, web-accessed randomization sequence. Randomization will be stratified by centre and age (<60 and ≥ 60 years). Within each stratum, variable permuted block sized will be used. This approach will ensure that concealment of the treatment sequence is maintained.

Duration of follow-up: Subjects will be followed daily until hospital discharge or death. Patients discharged from hospital before Day 30 will be contacted by telephone on Day 30 ± 3 days to ascertain any AEs, vital status (dead/alive), hospital readmission and need for mechanical ventilation after discharge. Patients discharged from hospital will be contacted at Day 90+/- 7 days to determine vital status. Patients with a prolonged hospital admission will be censored at Day 90. The local study coordinator will collect all study data and record the data in the electronic CRF or paper CRF as per study procedures for each site.

Duration of study: For an individual subject, the study ends 90 days after randomization. The overall study will end when the last randomized subject has completed 90 day follow-up. We estimate that all patient will be enrolled in a period of 6 months, data on the primary endpoint will be available 30 days after last patient enrollment and data on all secondary endpoints will be available after 90-day from last patient enrollment.

Sample size considerations: Assuming a baseline risk of intubation or death of 30% in hospitalized patients with standard of care, a sample size of 1200 (800 in the convalescent plasma arm, and 400 in the standard of care arm) would provide 80% power to detect a relative risk reduction of 25% with convalescent plasma therapy using a 2-tailed test at level α = 0.05 and a 2:1 randomization.

Interim analysis: A single interim analysis is planned when the primary outcome (intubation or mortality at 30 days) is available for 50% of the target sample. An O'Brien-Fleming stopping rule will be used at that time, but treated as a guideline, so there is minimal impact on the threshold for statistical significance for the final significance test of the primary outcome. A DSMB will monitor ongoing results to ensure patient well-being and safety as well as study integrity. The DSMB will be asked to recommend early termination or modification only when there is clear and substantial evidence of a treatment difference.

Final analysis plan: The primary analysis will be based on the intention-to-treat population which will include data from all individuals who have been randomized. Outcomes will be attributed to the arm to which individuals were randomized irrespective of whether they received the planned intervention (e.g. plasma from a convalescent COVID-19 donor).";"Problem to be addressed: In December 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Committee (Wuhan, China) identified an outbreak of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause.

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04308668;detailed_description;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a rapidly emerging viral infection causing COVID19. The current strategy uses a public health model of identifying infected cases, isolation, and quarantine to stop transmission. Once exposed, observation is standard-of-care. No effective therapy currently exists for treatment. The lack of effective therapy diminishes persons presenting post-exposure for self-quarantine. Having an effective post-exposure prophylaxis, even if only partially effective, may additionally create synergy for the public health strategy of case identification and isolation - if a safe prophylaxis is available. People who develop COVID-19 disease generally develop signs and symptoms, including mild respiratory symptoms and fever, after an average of 5-6 days after exposure (i.e. mean incubation period). The range of the incubation period is between 1 to 14 days. Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus have mild disease and recover. Approximately 80% of laboratory-confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, which includes non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases, 14% have severe disease, and 6% are critically ill with respiratory failure, shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction. Chloroquine or Hydroxychloroquine may have antiviral effects against SARS-COV2 which may prevent COVID19 disease or early preemptive therapy may ameliorate disease severity. This trial will use a modification of standard malaria dosing of hydroxychloroquine to provide post-exposure prophylaxis / preemptive therapy. The trial is open to enrollment of healthcare workers or household contacts from across the United States. For information on how to participate in the research trial, please email covid19@umn.edu for instructions.;"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a rapidly emerging viral infection causing COVID19. The current strategy uses a public health model of identifying infected cases, isolation, and quarantine to stop transmission. Once exposed, observation is standard-of-care. Therapy is generally not given to persons who are not hospitalized. The doses of hydroxychloroquine being used are within the normal standard FDA-approved doses.

Hydroxychloroquine may have antiviral effects against SARS-COV2 which may prevent COVID-19 disease or early preemptive therapy may decrease disease severity. This trial will use a modification of standard malaria dosing of hydroxychloroquine to provide post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent disease or preemptive therapy for those with early symptoms. People around the the United States and Canada can participate to help answer this critically important question. No in-person visits are needed.

This trial is targeting 5 groups of people NATIONWIDE to participate:

If you are symptomatic with a positive COVID-19 test within the first 4 days of symptoms and are not hospitalized; OR
If you live with someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19, with your last exposure within the last 4 days, and do not have any symptoms; OR
If you live with someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19, and your symptoms started within the last 4 days; OR
If you have had occupational exposure with known exposure to someone with lab-confirmed COVID-19 within the last 4 days and do not have symptoms; OR
If you have had occupational exposure with known exposure to someone with lab-confirmed COVID-19 within the last 4 days AND have compatible symptoms starting within the last 4 days;

You may participate if you live anywhere in the United States (including territories) or in the Canadian Provinces of Quebec, Manitoba, Alberta, or Ontario.

Immunoglobulins are used for the treatment of CMV disease, and is effective as prophylaxis when given soon after exposure to varicella zoster virus, rabies, and hepatitis B virus.

Neutralizing antibodies against MERS, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to be present in patients previously infected with MERS, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 respectively. During the 2003 SARS outbreak in Hong-Kong,a non-randomized study in hospitalized SARS patients showed that treatment with convalescent plasma (convP) from SARS-recovered donors significantly increased the day 22 discharge rate and decreased mortality. A study in non-human primates showed that rhesus macaques could not be re-infected with SARS-CoV-2 after primary infection.

With no proven effective therapy against COVID-19, this protocol will evaluate the therapeutic potential of therapy with convalescent plasma from COVID-19 recovered donors.

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04317040;detailed_description;As the newest global medical emergency, the COVID-19 (diagnosed SARS-CoV2 infection with lung involvement) exhibits features that are unlikely ameliorated by antivirals-based approaches alone. First, although the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infect lung and intestine, many patients suddenly take a turn for the worse even when the viral replication appears to be under control. Second, patients with serious or critical clinical symptoms show remarked T cell lymphopenia that are more severe and more acute than human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Functional exhaustion of T cells is suggested by high expression of T-cell exhaustion markers, which again appears more acute than in HIV patients. Third, multiple cytokines are elevated among patients with severe clinical symptoms, which potentially explains the multiple organ failure associated with COVID-19. For these reasons, treatment of COVID-19 likely requires a combination of both antivirals and non-antivirals-based approaches. CD24Fc is a biological immunomodulator in Phase II/III clinical trial stage. CD24Fc comprises the nonpolymorphic regions of CD24 attached to the Fc region of human IgG1. We have shown that CD24 is an innate checkpoint against the inflammatory response to tissue injuries or danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that CD24Fc effectively address the major challenges associated with COVID-19. First, a Phase I clinical trial on healthy volunteers not only demonstrated safety of CD24Fc, but also demonstrated its biological activity in suppressing expression of multiple inflammatory cytokines. Second, in Phase II clinical trial in leukemia patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT), three doses of CD24Fc effectively eliminated severe (Grade 3-4) acute graft vs host diseases (GVHD), which is caused by over reacting immune system and transplanted T cells attacking recipient target tissues. Third, in preclinical models of HIV/SIV infections, we have shown that CD24Fc ameliorated production of multiple inflammatory cytokines, reversed the loss of T lymphocytes as well as functional T cell exhaustion and reduced the leukocyte infiltration of multiple organs. It is particularly noteworthy that CD24Fc reduced the rate of pneumonia in SIV-infected Chinese rhesus monkey from 83% to 33%. Therefore, CD24Fc maybe a prime candidate for non-antiviral biological modifier for COVID-19 therapy. The phase III trial will involve 230 patients randomized into blinded placebo and CD24Fc arms, with time to clinical improvement from severe to mild symptom as the primary endpoint.;"As the newest global medical emergency, the COVID-19 (diagnosed SARS-CoV2 infection with lung involvement) exhibits features that are unlikely ameliorated by antivirals-based approaches alone.

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04348370;detailed_description;"Recruitment, Randomization, treatment allocation, and blinding

A standardized, IRB approved email will be sent to department chairs describing the study. A research coordinator will reach out to interested participants via phone with the help of an IRB-approved verbal script to introduce the study, confirm eligibility and provide further instructions on how to access and sign the IRB-approved ICD via REDCap using their own electronic devices. It is important that the investigators obtain the consent via REDCAp to a) avoid direct person-to-person contact and comply with social distancing imposed recommendations, and b) minimize the waste of reconstituted BCG by allowing the research personnel to schedule vaccinations in a controlled fashion. Patient registration into the trial will happen immediately after consent has been provided and will involve entering of baseline information into an electronic data capture system (RedCap).

Once the eligibility is confirmed and the ICD signed by the participant and stored in REDCap, the research coordinator will randomize the participant and communicate the treatment assignment to the nurse administering the vaccination. The nurse will subsequently assign an appointment and communicate date and time of vaccination with the participant. All eligible participants will receive intradermal injections of BCG:placebo in a 1:1 ratio.

Both, participants and investigators will be blinded to the treatment assignments during the study. However, in case of an emergency where it is important to know the treatment received, the investigator and/or participant can reach out to the unblinded study personnel who will provide the unblinded data. All participants will receive their treatment allocation at the end of the study, after the data analysis is finalized.

Unblinded personnel will not be involved in the collection and analysis of study data other than the baseline eligibility criteria.

The end of the study is defined as the last patient's last entry in the electronic data capture system.

Informed Consent and Eligibility

The following types of procedures will be conducted as indicated below:

Medical history will be obtained from patient medical record/clinical chart. Informed Consent will be obtained to access these records. When information cannot be obtained or is not available from the patient medical record/clinical chart, it will be obtained via patient interview. Physical examination will be conducted solely to look for existing BCG vaccination scars.

Symptom evaluation will be conducted via an electronic survey administered to participants every 1-3 days.

HIV and pregnancy will be collected as self-reported information. If unknown, a urine pregnancy test will be performed.

Nasopharyngeal, oral and/ or rectal swabs will be collected for rt-PCR test for SARS-CoV2 infection if a study develops symptoms consistent with Covid-19.

If a participant does not know their PPD/IGRA status from within the last 24 months (all health care providers should have this information), an IGRA can be performed to evaluate eligibility.

Study participants have the option of donating blood via phlebotomy (for serological test for Covid-19 disease and PBMCs for immune correlates) or providing a fingerstick and dried blood spot (for serologic test for Covid-19).

Data will be collected at four time points/periods: (1) after consent, (2) at baseline, (3) during follow-up period, and (4) at study end.

Data to be collected during screening includes medical history, physical exam results, results of rt-PCR and serological test results.

Data to be collected during baseline enrollment includes eligibility confirmation, demographic information, risk factors, randomization assignment, confirmation of BCG vaccination/placebo, any immediate reactions to BCG vaccination/placebo.

Data to be collected during follow-up includes intermittent surveys about the presence of flu-like symptoms, rt-PCR test results if done, serological test results, if testing positive for Covid-19 information regarding their disease course, and disease outcome status.

FOLLOW-UP PROCEDURES AND DATA COLLECTION:

Participants will be followed to assess whether they get infected with SARS-CoV2:

Participants will complete intermittent surveys via an electronic system every 1-3 days to assess the presence of any flu-like symptom, including sore throat, fever, headache, malaise, and cough. Note that this is part of routine surveillance for Covid-19 in health workers at the United States site. Consent forms will ask for consent to access this survey information.

Any positive response on the survey will trigger a nasopharyngeal, oral and/ or rectal swab to be collected to test for Covid-19 via rt-PCR

All participants, regardless of survey responses, will have serology for Covid-19 tested at 4 week intervals during the follow-up period (6 months)

If a participant completes the follow-up period and does not test positive for disease, their study participation is complete

If a participant does test positive for disease, their disease status will be ascertained for up to two months or until an outcome is available through one of the following mechanisms: (1) an electronic survey if they are not admitted to the hospital, including questions about the number of days they are ill, daily fever, and other symptoms; or (2) (2) if they are admitted to the hospital, ordinal outcomes for disease severity will be extracted from the hospital¿s electronic medical records system.

During the first week of follow-up, all participants will actively be asked about any adverse events; thereafter, participants will report unsolicited AEs through the electronic survey. Vaccine related adverse events will be graded using the FDA guidance (https://www.fda.gov/media/73679/download) and noted using WHO-recommended Adverse event following Immunization forms (AEFI; https://vaccine-safety-training.org/classification-of-aefis.html).

Participants will have the option of donating 12 mL of blood for plasma (serology) and PBMCs for secondary analysis of immune correlates and for future analysis based on covid19-specific IgM and IgG. If they do not donate 12mL of blood, a fingerstick will be required for baseline COVID19 serology.

Dried Blood Spot (DBS): all participants are HCWs and will self-collect DBS samples at week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24. Envelopes to store the DBS are provided upon enrollment and can be dropped off at work and picked up by study coordinators to minimize HCW distractions.

COVID specific RNA is found in stool for ~21 days when an individual develops infection (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2196-x). Participants will have the option of collecting stool swabs monthly if they are asymptomatic or weekly if they develop symptoms. Nucleic acid testing will be performed in retrospect to support secondary objectives.

If participants develop symptoms consistent with COVD19, will be PCR tested for COVID19. They will be given the option of donating 12 mL of blood for plasma and PBMCs 2 weeks after symptoms resolve.

Week 12 (+/- 2 Weeks), participants will be given the option to donate 12 mL of blood for plasma and PBMCs for secondary analysis of immune correlates and for future secondary analysis based on covid-specific IgM and IgG.

Week 24 (+/- 2 Weeks), participants will be given the option to donate 12 mL of blood for plasma and

PBMCs for secondary analysis of immune correlates and for future secondary analysis based on covid-specific IgM and IgG.

Except for the administration of BCG vaccine or placebo and the above mentioned DBS and phlebotomy, participants will undergo no invasive procedures for study purposes.

There is currently no vaccine and no specific antiviral treatment recommended for 2019-nCoV infection. About 20% of the patients were severe and some died of respiratory failure or multiple organ failure. Therefore, it is urgent to find a safe and effective therapeutic approach to pneumonia patients infected with 2019-nCoV. In the last year, the promising features of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), including their regenerative properties and ability to differentiate into diverse cell lineages, have generated great interest among researchers whose work has offered intriguing perspectives on cell-based therapies for various diseases. These findings seem to highlight that the beneficial effect of MSC-based treatment could be principally due by the immunomodulation and regenerative potential of these cells. The investigators found that infusions of UC-MSC significantly improved liver function in decompensated liver cirrhosis and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) patients, increased the survival rate in acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) patients .

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04280705;brief_summary;This study is an adaptive, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of novel therapeutic agents in hospitalized adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The study is a multicenter trial that will be conducted in up to 50 sites globally. The study will be a series of 2-arm comparisons between different investigational therapeutic agents and a placebo. There will be interim monitoring to introduce new arms and allow early stopping for futility, efficacy, or safety. If one therapy proves to be efficacious, this treatment will then become the control arm for comparison(s) with new experimental treatment(s). Because of the possibility that background standards of supportive care may evolve/improve over time as more is learned about successful management of COVID-19, comparisons of safety and efficacy will be based on data from concurrently randomized participants. An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will actively monitor interim data to make recommendations about early study closure or changes to study arms. Randomization will be stratified by: 1) site and 2) severity of illness at enrollment, severe disease (requiring mechanical ventilation or oxygen, a SpO2 </= 94% or tachypnea (respiratory rate >/= 24 breaths/min)) or mild-moderate disease (SpO2 > 94% and respiratory rate < 24 breaths/min without supplemental oxygen)). Subjects will be assessed daily while hospitalized. Discharged patients will be asked to attend study visits at Days 15, and 29. All subjects will undergo a series of efficacy, safety, and laboratory assessments. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of different investigational therapeutics relative to the control arm in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.;This study is an adaptive, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of novel therapeutic agents in hospitalized adults diagnosed with COVID-19. The study is a multicenter trial that will be conducted in up to approximately 100 sites globally. The study will compare different investigational therapeutic agents to a control arm. There will be interim monitoring to introduce new arms and allow early stopping for futility, efficacy, or safety. If one therapy proves to be efficacious, then this treatment may become the control arm for comparison(s) with new experimental treatment(s). Any such change would be accompanied by an updated sample size. Because background standards of supportive care may evolve/improve over time as more is learned about successful management of COVID-19, comparisons of safety and efficacy will be based on data from concurrently randomized subjects. An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will actively monitor interim data to make recommendations about early study closure or changes to study arms.

The secondary objectives of the study are to 1) evaluate the clinical efficacy of different investigational therapeutics as compared to the control arm as assessed by clinical severity, hospitalization, and mortality, and 2) evaluate the safety of the intervention through 28 days of follow-up as compared to the control arm.;"This study is an adaptive, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of novel therapeutic agents in hospitalized adults diagnosed with COVID-19.

An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will actively monitor interim data to make recommendations about early study closure or changes to study arms.

The initial sample size is projected to be 572 subjects to achieve 400 subjects with a ""recovered"" status (per the primary objective). The primary analysis will be based on those subjects enrolled in order to 400 recoveries. An additional analysis of the moderate severity subgroup (those with baseline status of ""Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen"" or ""Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring ongoing medical care"") is also of public health importance. Hence, enrollment will be permitted until the date of April 20, 2020 to ensure 400 recoveries and provide additional data about this important subgroup. With recent enrollment rates, the total sample size may be 600 to over 800.

Subjects will be assessed daily while hospitalized. If the subjects are discharged from the hospital, they will have a study visit at Days 15, 22, and 29 as an outpatient. For discharged subjects, it is preferred that the Day 15 and 29 visits are in person to obtain safety laboratory tests and OP swab and blood (serum only) samples for secondary research as well as clinical outcome data. However, infection control or other restrictions may limit the ability of the subject to return to the clinic. In this case, Day 15 and 29 visits may be conducted by phone, and only clinical data will be obtained. The Day 22 visit does not have laboratory tests or collection of samples and may also be conducted by phone.

All subjects will undergo a series of efficacy, safety, and laboratory assessments. Safety laboratory tests and blood (serum and plasma) research samples and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs will be obtained on Days 1 (prior to infusion) and Days 3, 5, 8, and 11 (while hospitalized). OP swabs and blood (serum only) plus safety laboratory tests will be collected on Day 15 and 29 (if the subject attends an in-person visit or are still hospitalized).

The primary outcome is time to recovery by Day 29. A key secondary outcome evaluates treatment-related improvements in the 8-point ordinal scale at Day 15. As little is known about the clinical course of COVID-19, a pilot study will be used for a blinded sample size reassessment."

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04252664;detailed_description;In December 2019, Wuhan, in Hubei province, China, became the center of an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause. In a short time, Chinese scientists had shared the genome information of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from these pneumonia patients and developed a real-time reverse transcription PCR (real time RT-PCR) diagnostic assay. Whilst the outbreak is likely to have started from a zoonotic transmission event associated with a large seafood market that also traded in live wild animals, it soon became clear that person-to-person transmission was also occurring. The number of cases of infection with 2019-nCoV identified in Wuhan increased markedly over the later part of January 2020, with cases identified in multiple other Provinces of China and internationally. Mathematical models of the expansion phase of the epidemic suggested that sustained person-to-person transmission is occurring, and the R-zero is substantially above 1, the level required for a self-sustaining epidemic in human populations. The clinical spectrum of 2019-nCoV infection appears to be wide, encompassing asymptomatic infection, a mild upper respiratory tract illness, and severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure and even death. Although the per infection risk of severe disease remains to be determined, and may differ from the initial reports of 10-15%, the large number of cases in Wuhan has resulted in a large number of patients hospitalised with pneumonia. Progression from prodromal symptoms (usually fever, fatigue, cough) to severe pneumonia requiring supplementary oxygen support, mechanical ventilation, or in some cases ECMO appears to occur most commonly during the second week of illness in association with persistent viral RNA detection. This provides a window of opportunity to test candidate antiviral therapeutics. This new coronavirus, and previous experiences with SARS and MERS-CoV, highlight the need for therapeutics for human coronavirus infections that can improve clinical outcomes, reduce risk of disease progression, speed recovery, and reduce the requirements for intensive supportive care and prolonged hospitalisation. In addition, treatments for mild cases to reduce the duration of illness and infectivity may also be of value were 2019-nCoV to become pandemic and/or endemic in human populations. Given no specific antiviral therapy for 2019-nCoV infection and the availability of remdesvir as a potential antiviral agent based on pre-clinical studies in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, this randomized, controlled, double blind trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of remdesivir in patients hospitalized with mild or moderate 2019-nCoV respiratory disease.;"In December 2019, Wuhan, in Hubei province, China, became the center of an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause.

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04276896;detailed_description;Background: The 2019 discovered new coronavirus, Covid-19, is an enveloped positive strand single strand RNA virus. The number of Covid-19 infected people has increased rapidly and WHO has warned that the spread of Covid-19 may soon become pandemic and have disastrous outcomes. Covid-19 could pose a serious threat to human health and global economy. There is no vaccine available or clinically approved antiviral therapy as yet. This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of treating Covid-19 infections with a novel lentiviral based DC and T cell vaccines. Objective: Primary study objectives: Injection and infusion of LV-SMENP DC and antigen-specific cytotoxic T cell vaccines to healthy volunteers and Covid-19 infected patients to evaluate the safety. Secondary study objectives: To evaluate the anti- Covid-19 efficacy of the LV-SMENP DC and antigen-specific cytotoxic T cell vaccines. Design: 1. Based on the genomic sequence of the new coronavirus Covid-19, select conserved and critical structural and protease protein domains to engineer lentiviral SMENP minigenes to express Covid-19 antigens. 2. LV-SMENP-DC vaccine is made by modifying DC with lentivirus vectors expressing Covid-19 minigene SMENP and immune modulatory genes. CTLs will be activated by LV-DC presenting Covid-19 specific antigens. 3. LV-DC vaccine and antigen-specific CTLs are prepared in 7~21 days. Subject will receive total 5x10^6 cells of LV-DC vaccine and 1x10^8 antigen-specific CTLs via sub-cutaneous injection and IV infusion, respectively.

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04305106;brief_summary;The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a new strain of coronavirus found in the human body in 2019. Its infectious disease causes a public health crisis. Novel coronavirus pneumonia is a common respiratory disorder. The treatment is high respiratory oxygen therapy, noninvasive mechanical ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation and other clinical respiratory support therapies, but there is no specific drug. Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody. As an anti VEGF drug, bevacizumab has been used in anti-tumor treatment for nearly 20 years, and its safety is well guaranteed. Among the adverse reactions, hypertension, fatigue or fatigue, diarrhea and abdominal pain were the most frequent. The most serious adverse reactions reported were gastrointestinal perforation, hemorrhage and arterial thromboembolism, but the incidence was relatively low. In February 15, 2020, a novel coronavirus pneumonia trial was conducted in 11 patients with severe and severe new crown pneumonia. It suggested that bevacizumab plus conventional therapy was effective in treating dyspnea symptoms in patients with new coronary artery pneumonia, and no obvious adverse reactions were observed. The aim of novel coronavirus pneumonia is to investigate the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab in the treatment of severe and severe new crown pneumonia with dyspnea and diffuse pulmonary lesions. The subjects were randomly divided into intervention group and control group. On the basis of routine treatment, bevacizumab or placebo were given at the 24th hour after admission to the group. Blood gas analysis, laboratory examination and chest imaging examination were performed after administration to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of bevacizumab.;The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a new strain of coronavirus found in human in 2019, which causes epidemic worldwide. Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) causes acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the severe and critically severe patients. Pulmonary edema is the key detrimental feature of ALI/ARDS. Autopsy of patients died from COVID-19 reported that, pulmonary mucus exudation was severe, more obvious than SARS infection. Pulmonary CT scanning and pathological findings also suggest that pulmonary edema caused by inflammatory exudation is a distinguished feature of COVID-19. However, specific pharmacotherapy is lacking.Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is known as the most potent inducing factors to increase vascular permeability. Bevacizumab is an anti VEGF recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody, which has been used in anti-tumor treatment for 16 years. Evidence suggest that Bevacizumab is a promising drug for severe and critical COVID-19 patients.

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04341688;brief_summary;"Pakistan is a resource restraint country, it's not possible to carry out coronavirus testing at mass scale. Owing to the aerosol producing nature of the dental profession, carrying out dental work on asymptomatic patients carrying coronavirus puts the entire dental team at a great risk of not only acquiring the infection but also transmitting it to the others.

Identifying an antiviral gargle that could substantially reduce the colonies of COVID-19 residing in mouth and oro-pharynx is likely to reduce the viral load. This topical therapy is speculated to substantially reduce the transmission of infection in micro-aerosol generated in the dental practice. Such topical anti-viral therapy could also help to improve the overall symptoms of the patient. Given the apparent mechanical rather than blood-borne slow advance of coronavirus from nasopharnyx to lung, the possibility exists that reducing viral load through debriding could aid effective immune response in the same way that debriding burns reduces time of healing.";"Pakistan is a resource restraint country, it's not possible to carry out coronavirus testing at mass scale. Simple cost effective intervention against the present pandemic is highly desirable.

For patients: Identifying an antiviral gargle that could substantially reduce the colonies of COVID-19 residing in mouth and oro-naso-pharynx is likely to reduce the viral load. Such reduction in the viral load through surface debridement could aid the effective immune response in improving the overall symptoms of the patients.

For dentists: This study is important because the nature of the dental profession involves aerosol production, carrying out dental work on asymptomatic patients carrying coronavirus puts the entire dental team at a great risk of not only acquiring the infection but also transmitting it to the others. Antiviral gargles could be used by dentist and their auxiliaries as prophylaxis.

For physicians and nurses: The risk of morbidity and mortality is high among physicians and nurses involved in the screening and management of Covid-19 patients. Globally, over 215 physicians and surgeons have died while taking care of Covid-19 patients. The cause of death is attributed to high exposure of viral load. The antiviral gargles and nasal lavage can decrease the fatalities among doctors and nurses.

Thus, patients, physicians, nurses and dentists, all could be benefited with this findings of this study."

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04288102;detailed_description;The epidemic of 2019 novel coronavirus (causing the disease Covid-19) has expanded from Wuhan throughout China and is being exported to a growing number of countries, some of which have seen onward transmission. COVID-19 caused clusters of severe respiratory illness and was associated with 2% mortality. There is currently no vaccine and no specific antiviral treatment recommended for COVID-19. About 20% of the patients were severe and the mainstay of clinical management is largely symptomatic treatment, with organ support in intensive care for seriously ill patients. Therefore, it is urgent to find a safe and effective therapeutic approach to COVID-19. In the last years, the promising features of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), including their regenerative properties and ability to differentiate into diverse cell lineages, have generated great interest among researchers whose work has offered intriguing perspectives on cell-based therapies for various diseases. These findings seem to highlight that the beneficial effect of MSC-based treatment could be principally due by the immunomodulation and regenerative potential of these cells. MSCs could significantly reduce the pathological changes of lung and inhibit the cell-mediated immune inflammatory response induced by influenza virus in animal model . MSCs has been shown to reduce nonproductive inflammation and affect tissue regeneration and is being evaluated in patients with ARDS. Our phase I preliminary data of parallel assignment study(NCT04252118) showed that three doses of MSCs was safe in patients with COVID-19. Randomized control trial are needed to assess efficacy and safety. The investigators will do a prospective, double-blind, multicentre, randomised trial to assess treatment with three intravenous doses of MSCs compared with placebo. 90 severe COVID-19 patients will be recruited in China. 60 patients receive i.v. transfusion 3 times of MSCs（ 4.0*10E7 cells per time), as the treated group, all of them receive the conventional treatment.

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04257656;detailed_description;In December 2019, Wuhan, in Hubei province, China, became the center of an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause. In a short time, Chinese scientists had shared the genome information of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from these pneumonia patients and developed a real-time reverse transcription PCR (real time RT-PCR) diagnostic assay. Whilst the outbreak is likely to have started from a zoonotic transmission event associated with a large seafood market that also traded in live wild animals, it soon became clear that person-to-person transmission was also occurring. The number of cases of infection with 2019-nCoV identified in Wuhan increased markedly over the later part of January 2020, with cases identified in multiple other Provinces of China and internationally. Mathematical models of the expansion phase of the epidemic suggested that sustained person-to-person transmission is occurring, and the R-zero is substantially above 1, the level required for a self-sustaining epidemic in human populations. The clinical spectrum of 2019-nCoV illness appears to be wide, encompassing asymptomatic infection, a mild upper respiratory tract infection, and severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure and even death. Although the per infection risk of severe disease remains to be determined, case-fatality risk of 11-14% has been reported in several initial studies of seriously ill patients and case-fatality has been estimated approximately at 2% overall. Also the large number of cases in Wuhan has resulted in a large number of patients hospitalised with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen and sometimes more advance ventilator support. This new coronavirus, and previous experiences with SARS and MERS-CoV, highlight the need for therapeutics for human coronavirus infections that can improve clinical outcomes, speed recovery, and reduce the requirements for intensive supportive care and prolonged hospitalisation.

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04315948;detailed_description;This study is a multi-centre, adaptive, randomized, open clinical trial of the safety and efficacy of treatments of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults. The study is a multi-centre/country trial that will be conducted in up to 50 sites globally with multiple sponsors. Adults (≥18 year-old) hospitalized for COVID- 19 with SpO2 ≤ 94% on room air OR acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and/or supplemental oxygen will be randomized between 4 treatment arms, each to be given in addition to the usual standard of care (SoC) in the participating hospital: SoC alone versus SoC + Remdesivir versus SoC + Lopinavir/Ritonavir versus SoC + Lopinavir/Ritonavir plus interferon ß-1a. Randomization will be stratified by site and severity of illness at enrollment (moderate disease: patients NOT requiring non-invasive ventilation NOR high flow oxygen devices NOR invasive mechanical ventilation NOR ECMO and severe disease: patients requiring non-invasive ventilation OR high flow oxygen devices OR invasive mechanical ventilation OR ECMO). The interim trial results will be monitored by a Data Monitoring Committee, and if at any stage evidence emerges that any one treatment arm is definitely inferior then it will be centrally decided that that arm will be discontinued. Conversely, if good evidence emerges while the trial is continuing that some other treatment(s) should also be being evaluated then it will be centrally decided that one or more extra arms will be added while the trial is in progress.

The score is based on six different scores, one each for the respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation, renal, and neurological systems. Each organ system is assigned a point value from 0 (normal) to 4 (high degree of dysfunction/failure). Outcome is reported as only the respiratory component score. Respiratory scores range from 0-4, with higher scores indicating greater chance of mortality due to respiratory failure.;Outcome calculated from the partial pressure of oxygen or peripheral saturation of oxygen by pulse oximetry divided by the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2 or SaO2 : FiO2 ratio). PaO2 is preferentially used if available. A correction is applied for endotracheal intubation and/or positive end-expiratory pressure. Patients discharged prior to day 7 will have a home pulse oximeter send home for measurement of the day 7 value, and will be adjusted for home O2 use, if applicable. Patients who died will be applied a penalty with a P/F ratio of 0.

Age 18 or older.
Confirmed Covid-19 infection
ARDS
ICU patient

Exclusion Criteria:

Active Neisseria infection.
Concomitant enrollment in another experimental/off-label immunosuppressive therapy trial."
clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04288713;detailed_description;Patients affected with Covid-19 will be offered informed written consent. An FDA emergency IND form will be sent. Once approved, the patient will then be vaccinated with both the seronegative and quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines. Subsequently, antibiotic coverage against Nessieria Meningitis will be initiated and stopped no sooner than 2 weeks after the vaccinations were administered. The entire vaccination protocol should be completed. Soliris will be administered in the following manner: 900mg IV every 7 days for 4 weeks THEN 1200mg IV on the 5th week THEN 1200mg IV every 14 days ongoing until at least one month after the patient has recovered from the virus. Administration of Soliris as early as possible after diagnosis to prevent compliment mediated mortality & injury is ideal. Supportive care will continue during the administration of soliris Once recovered the patient's blood will be collected and sent for possible recovery of an antibody with the hopes that it may aid in the creation of a vaccine against Covid-19. Follow up at day 7, 14, and 28 after discharge.;"Recorded Endpoints:

Mortality
Time in the ICU
Time on a ventilator

Administrative:

An Emergency FDA IND must be submitted (FDA form 3926) for each patient.

Subsequent to approval the primary investigator will obtain an authorization letter from Alexion Pharmaceuticals.

Implementation:

Prior to dosing the patient must receive ceftriaxone IV and this must be continued during the entire duration of therapy (vaccination will be mentioned shortly and is the only exception to prophylactic antibiotic coverage). If there is a clinical reason why the patient cannot receive Ceftriaxone (allergy, supply, etc) then an alternative prophylactic antibiotic covering Neisseria meningitis must be given for the duration of therapy. The SeroB and Quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines can be given if the duration of antibiotic therapy becomes unsafe or unfeasible. In that case, antibiotic therapy should be withdrawn no sooner than 2 weeks after vaccination with both meningococcal vaccines (see ACIP guidelines in complement deficient patients). It is preferred that vaccination is avoided while the patient is acutely ill and that prophylactic antibiotics are used as meningococcal vaccination can upregulate the immune system possibly worsening the patient's condition.

Standard dosing protocol - Eculizumab 900mg IV every 7 days. Eculizumab is given IV over 30 minutes without the need of a pump (although one can be used if available).

Supplemental doses of eculizumab can be given if clinically warranted at the discretion of the investigator and clinical team.

The team should perform Murray scores daily for the first 72 hours THEN every other day unless a change is deemed necessary by the attending physician. (table 2)

Complement blood levels should be drawn every 72 hours. They may be drawn sooner if there is clinical inquiry which would affect clinical decision making and/or after a dose of Eculizumab is given.

The duration of therapy is at the discretion of the clinical team and investigator.

Follow up at day 7, 14, and 28 after discharge."

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04311697;detailed_description;Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome is a known lethal complication of Corona Virus (COVID-19) infection. Conventional medical therapy, including intensive care and respiratory support is associated with a 35%-50% mortality. Aviptadil, a synthetic form of Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP) has been awarded FDA Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of ARDS. Nonclinical studies demonstrate that VIP is highly concentrated in the lung, where it prevents NMDA-induced caspase-3 activation in the lung, inhibits IL6 and TNFa production, protects against HCl-induced pulmonary edema, These and other effects have been observed in numerous animal model systems of lung injury in mice, rats, guinea pigs, sheep, swine, and dogs. In these models, Aviptadil restores barrier function at the endothelial/alveolar interface and thereby protects the lung and other organs from failure. Aviptadil is approved for human use in Europe and has a demonstrated 20 year history of safety in numerous trials for Sarcoid, Pulmonary Fibrosis, Bronchospasm, Erectile Dysfunction, and a phase I trial in ARDS. Five phase 2 trials have been conducted under European regulatory authority. Numerous healthy volunteer studies have shown that i.v. infusion of Aviptadil is well tolerated with few adverse effects including alterations in blood pressure, heart rate, or ECG. In addition to published studies of human use, Aviptadil has been used on a compounded basis in certain ICUs for many years in the belief that it preserves life and restores function in pulmonary hypertension, ARDS, and Acute Lung Injury (ALI). In this study, patients who are hospitalized and intubated for ARDS secondary to COVID-19 infection will be randomly allocated to Aviptadil administered by intravenous infusion, nebulization via the endotracheal tube, and both IV and endotracheal administration. Primary endpoints will be improvement in blood oxygenation and mortality.;"Acute Lung Injury, which causes Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a known lethal complication of Corona Virus (COVID-19) infection.

In that phase I trial, 8 patients with severe ARDS on mechanical ventilation were treated with ascending doses of VIP. Seven of the 8 patients were successfully extubated and were alive at the five day timepoint. Six left the hospital and one died of an unrelated cardiac event.

It was frequently reported that 2019-nCoV could be a public health crisis with high infectiousness, and it naturally spread across the country. Most of patients with 2019-nCoV infection were found to have non-specific symptoms including fever, cough, myalgia and fatigue. In addition, some patients were more likely to develop severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), or even die. However, there was no timely and effective treatment of patients with 2019-nCoV infection. Traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs), are derived from plants and usually incorporate one or more herbs as the basic drug(s) to treat the disease. An RCT was performed to investigate TCM was effective and safe for treating 2019-nCoV infection. Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio, and 1 subject on conventional medicines and TCMs granules for every 1 subject on conventional medicines. According to recommendations for prevention and control of pneumonia cause by 2019-nCoV infection from China National Health Commission, conventional medicines involve oxygen therapy and antiviral therapy (alfa interferon via aerosol inhalation, and lopinavir/ritonavir, p.o).

Interim analyses are included at 75 and 175 matched participants to compare the effect and safety of each experimental treatment to control (placebo). The results of the interim analyses are used to decide if one or more treatments should be discontinued due to either futility or harm. An arm is discontinued if either of the predefined stopping criteria are met. For the remaining arms, further patients are recruited until a decision has been reached or until a maximum number of patients is reached.

Additional experimental treatments may be added as they become available. Any efficacious treatment identified in this or any other high-quality RCT may become the new SOC after consensus by national and international societies, and, thus, the control arm will change accordingly and in parallel."

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04344184;detailed_description;"In December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases was reported in Wuhan, China, and a novel coronavirus, SARS-Cov-2, was identified. The World Health Organization (WHO) designated the respiratory disease as coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on February 12, 2020. Numerous reports have since characterized the COVID-19 clinical syndrome, ranging from asymptomatic/mild disease to severe disease leading to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation (i.e., ARDS, multi-organ failure, sepsis, and death).

A safe, effective, and inexpensive therapy is urgently needed, one that can alter the natural course of the disease process and reduce strain on healthcare systems. High Dose Intravenous Vitamin C is a safe and possibly effective treatment for ARDS and has been described to be effective for ARDS of viral origin.

A double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized control trial from our institution involving 167 patients with ARDS who were randomized to receive 50 mg/kg every 6 hours of HDIVC for 4 days versus placebo showed a statistically significant difference in 28-day all-cause mortality. The 28-day mortality was 29.8% in the vitamin C group versus 46.3% in the placebo group, although this was a secondary outcome.

This can be translated as a Number Needed to Treat (NNT) of 6-8 patients to save one life from ARDS. The statistical effect on mortality remained up to 60-days following trial completion.

We, therefore, cannot withhold the treatment from patients with ARDS. It remains unknown if HDIVC given early can prevent the progression to ARDS and if it is effective in COVID-19 ARDS.

The first study, published in 1986, treated 16 ARDS patients with intravenous vitamin C (1000 mg IV every 6 hours) plus antioxidants versus 16 ARDS patients who received the standard care at that time (i.e., control group). There was a reduction in mortality in the vitamin C group: 37% versus 71% in the standard care group (p<0.01). A phase I trial in 2014 proved that plasma vitamin C in patients with severe sepsis and ARDS were low, almost at scorbutic levels and that HDIVC administration had a dose-dependent effect in the prevention of multi-organ failure, as measured by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores.

Patients who received a total of 200 mg/kg/day of HDIVC for 4 days (administered in 50 mg/kg/dose, every 6 hours), had significantly lower organ failure scores than placebo, and even lower scores than the patients who received lower-doses of IV vitamin C (50 mg/kg/day administered at 12.5 mg/kg/dose, every 6 hours for 4 days). In this trial, the patients in the HDIVC group (200 mg/kg/day) achieved plasma levels up to 3,000 µM on day 4.

To assess the treatment effect of a 72-hour intravenous vitamin C infusion protocol (100 mg/kg every 8 hours) in patients with hypoxemia and suspected COVID-19 (Novel Coronavirus ID-19). In the course of performing this phase 2 trial we will explore three following hypotheses:

Primary Endpoint: HDIVC infusion will increase 28-day ventilator-free days. Secondary Endpoint A: HDIVC infusion will reduce 28-day all-cause hospital mortality.

Secondary Endpoint B: HDIVC infusion will significantly increase acute inflammation-free days (defined as CRP >=10 mg/L) among COVID-19 patients.

Secondary Endpoint C: HDIVC infusion will be safe, as demonstrated by organ-failure-free days up to 28 days.";"In December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases was reported in Wuhan, China, and a novel coronavirus, SARS-Cov-2, was identified.

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04173663;intervention_model_description;Parallel Assignment;After eligibility is determined and baseline data are collected, parents will be randomized, in two cohorts, to the treatment or materials-only control condition. Given the relatively small sample size in each cohort at each site (n = 30 at each of three sites), simple randomization is not recommended as it might result in unequal group sizes. The investigators will use 1:1 block randomization within each site to give equal number of subjects in each group. To ensure balance of important covariates, the investigators will block on key moderators: whether the youth has an Intellectual Disability (ID) and is in high school. Co-occurring ID and being in vs. out of high school impact service eligibility, and ID impacts the likelihood of post-secondary education (PSE) and community employment. By balancing moderators, the researchers maximize power to detect effect modification of the treatment effect.

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04157296;intervention_desc;;"The CBT intervention will consist of 12 weekly 60 minute sessions of the manualized therapy, adapted from the Coping Cat program, for the treatment of pediatric anxiety disorders.; CCT intervention will consist of approximately 30 minutes of CCT games prior to each CBT session, to engage cognitive control capacity prior to receipt of CBT. The CCT games will be designed to target focused attention, response inhibition, working memory and multiple simultaneous attention to constitute a general executive function training, and activate neural systems associated with executive function/cognitive control. Difficulty of the games will be titrated individually and by session to avoid boredom and progressively activate the functional systems underlying cognitive control."
