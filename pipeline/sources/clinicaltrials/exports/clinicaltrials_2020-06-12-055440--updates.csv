Prior experience with respiratory viruses and limited data that have emerged from China suggest that convalescent plasma has the potential to lessen the severity or shorten the length of illness caused by COVID-19. It is important that we evaluate this potential therapy in the context of clinical trials.

As such, this study will assess the feasibility of administering multiple doses of convalescent plasma (from people who have recovered form SARS-CoV-2) to Covid-19 positive patients in the Intensive Care Unit receiving mechanical ventilation. Donor plasma will not be obtained under this protocol, but all plasma used will follow FDA guidelines for Investigational COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma use.

This study will be opened across three separate site: Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Johns Hopkins University, and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. 30 patients will be recruited at each site. Each site has received its own FDA IND and IRB approval. As such, the following people are serving as sponsor-investigators at their respective institutions.

Feasibility will be assessed based on the proportion of subjects who consent and receive at least one dose of convalescent plasma. The study will be declared 'feasible' if at least 80% of subjects who consent receive at least one dose.

Patients are tested with a VivaDiag ™ COVID-19 lgM / IgG Rapid Test at day 0, day 7 and day 14. The investigators expect test to be negative on all the measurements in those patients that do not develop symptoms and that continue to have no known history of exposure to COVID-19 Patients that develop symptoms (cough, fever or respiratory distress) and a possible contact with people positive for COVID-19 OR patients that show a positive VivaDiag test during the time frame of the test are asked to attend the COVID-19 RT - PCR &CT. Subsequently, the investigators will continue, repeating two tests seven days apart every 30 days (predefined times 0-7-14, then 30-37, 60-67) for the next six months. The investigators can evaluate to stop the test however before the six months if there are no new cases of COVID-19 for at least 21 days in the region where the enrolled patients live. The test in use is the VivaDiag ™ COVID-19 lgM / IgG Procedure (as per the protocol in use for the administration of the test) 1. take out the test kit and leave it at least 30 minutes in the room where the test will be performed. 2. place the test equipment on a clean and dust-free surface 3.

The anti-COVID-19 lgM antibody is detected if: the quality control band C and the lgM band are both colored and the lgG band does not stain. This means that the anti-COVID-19 lgM antibody is positive. 2. The anti-COVID-19 lgG antibody is detected if: the quality control band C and the lgG band are both colored and the lgM band does not stain. This means that the COVID-19 lgG antibody is positive. 3. The lgG and lgM anti-COVID-19 antibodies are detected if: the C band, the lgG band and the lgM band are all three colored. This means that the anti-COVID-19 lgG and lgM antibodies are both positive. Negative result The anti-COVID-19 lgG and lgM antibodies are not detected if only the quality control C band is stained but the lgG and lgM bands are not colored, this means that the test is negative.

Interpretation of test results

Positive result

The anti-COVID-19 lgM antibody is detected if: the quality control band C and the lgM band are both colored and the lgG band does not stain. This means that the anti-COVID-19 lgM antibody is positive.
The anti-COVID-19 lgG antibody is detected if: the quality control band C and the lgG band are both colored and the lgM band does not stain. This means that the COVID-19 lgG antibody is positive.
The lgG and lgM anti-COVID-19 antibodies are detected if: the C band, the lgG band and the lgM band are all three colored. This means that the anti-COVID-19 lgG and lgM antibodies are both positive.

Negative result The anti-COVID-19 lgG and lgM antibodies are not detected if only the quality control C band is stained but the lgG and lgM bands are not colored, this means that the test is negative.

Invalid result

If the quality control band C does not color, regardless of whether the lgG and lgM bands are colored or not, the result is invalid and the test must be started again.

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04342689;detailed_description;"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a substantial strain on the healthcare system, with at least 14% of infected patients requiring hospitalization. Identifying ways to ameliorate the progression and severity of the COVID-19 infection and preventing hospitalization is critical.

Patients suffering from COVID-19 have been shown to have a significant inflammatory response resembling that of cytokine release syndrome, and it is this inflammatory phase that is thought to drive fatality. IL-6 has been shown to be one of the most commonly elevated inflammatory markers in COVID-19 patients, and Tocilizumab, an IL-6 inhibitor, has been used to ameliorate this exaggerated inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients. However, this is used mainly in already hospitalized patients who show signs of increased inflammation, and more research is needed on interventions that slow the onset of inflammation and decrease subsequent hospitalization of infected individuals.

Resistant potato starch (RPS) has been shown to decrease IL-6 in humans, partly through its ability to increase butyrate levels. Butyrate not only reduces IL-6 production and overall inflammation, but also has been shown to specifically decrease lung inflammation in animal models through cytokine suppression. Further, it may reduce ACE2 receptor expression, which is the main entry mechanism for COVID-19 into epithelial lung cells. Increased butyrate in the intestinal microbiome is also associated with less viral lower respiratory tract infections in allo- HCT recipients. Our preliminary data shows an increase in butyrate levels in participants' stool within one week of RPS therapy (20 grams twice daily) with no noticeable side effect.

To this end, we have designed a multicenter randomized clinical trial to determine the efficacy of resistant potato starch in reducing the need for hospitalization for COVID-19 positive patients. We will enroll 1300 non-hospitalized COVID-19 positive individuals who are being monitored in the outpatient setting. Patients will be randomized to either receive RPS therapy (2 tablespoons (~ 20 grams) of RPS twice daily) or a placebo (2 tablespoons of non-resistant, digestible starch twice daily) , each for 14 days. Our primary outcome is the rate of hospitalization for COVID-19 related complications. Secondary outcomes will look at time to recovery and symptom severity scores.";"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a substantial strain on the healthcare system, with at least 14% of infected patients requiring hospitalization.

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04312243;detailed_description;In their efforts to provide care for patients with novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) infection, many healthcare workers around the globe exposed to SARS-CoV-2 got infected and died over the past two months. Quarantined nurses and physicians have become the norm in regions with COVID-19 patients, putting at risk the overall functionality of the regional healthcare system. Other than strict contact-precautions, no proven vaccination or targeted therapy is available to prevent COVID-19 in healthcare workers. Inhaled nitric oxide gas (NO) has shown in a small clinical study to have antiviral activity against a Coronavirus during the 2003 SARS outbreak. We have designed this study to assess whether intermittent inhaled NO in healthcare workers might prevent their infection with SARS-CoV-2. Background: After almost two months of fight against COVID-19 infection, on February 24, more than 3,000 physicians and nurses were reported as contracting COVID-19 disease in Wuhan (China). Fatalities among those healthcare workers were reported to be related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Implementation of strict contact protections for all healthcare personnel is essential to decrease and contain the risks of exposure. However, despite best efforts, dozens of thousands of healthcare providers have been quarantined for at least 14 consecutive days in Wuhan alone. Similarly data have been reported in Italy, several healthcare providers have been quarantined, developed pneumonia and died. Most recent information from Italy reported that 12% of healthcare workers are infected. The shortage of hospital personnel, especially in the critical care and anesthesiology domains, led many hospitals to postpone indefinitely scheduled surgical procedures, including cardiac surgery or oncological procedures. Only urgent and emergent cases are performed in patients without symptoms (i.e., absence of fever, cough or dyspnea), no signs (i.e., negative chest CT for consolidations, normal complete blood count) and a negative test on SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase (rt)-PCR. If time does not allow for thorough screening (i.e., after traumatic injury), such patients are considered to be infected and medical staff in the OR are fully protected with third degree protections (i.e., N95 masks, goggles, protective garments and a gown and double gloving). Rationale. In 2004 in a collaborative study between the virology laboratory at the University of Leuven (Belgium), the Clinical Physiology Laboratory of Uppsala University (Sweden) and the General Airforce Hospital of China (Beijing, China), nitric oxide (NO) donors (e.g. S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine) greatly increased the survival rate of infected eukaryotic cells with the coronavirus responsible for SARS (SARS-CoV-1), suggesting direct antiviral effects of NO. These authors suggest that oxidation is the antiviral mechanism of nitric oxide. A later work by Akerstrom and colleagues showed that NO or its derivatives reduce palmitoylation SARS-CoV spike (S) protein affecting its fusion with angiotensin converting enzyme 2. Furthermore, NO or its derivatives reduce viral RNA synthesis in the infected cells. Future in-vitro studies should confirm that NO donors are equally effective against SARS-CoV-2, as the current virus shares 88% of its genome with the SARS-CoV [3]. However, at present it is reasonable to assess that a high dose of inhaled NO might be anti-viral against SARS-CoV-2 in the lung. The virus is transmitted by human-to-human contact and occurs primarily via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes within a range of about 1.5 meters. The incubation period ranges from 1 to 14 days with an estimated median incubation period of 5 to 6 days according to the World Health Organization [1]. COVID-19 disease is mainly a respiratory system disease, but in the most severe forms can progress to impair also other organ function (i.e., kidneys, liver, heart). Nitric oxide gas inhalation has been successfully and safely used for decades (since 1990) in thousands of newborns and adults to decrease pulmonary artery pressure and improve systemic oxygenation. Recently at the Massachusetts General Hospital, a high dose of inhaled NO (160 ppm) for 30 - 60 minutes was delivered twice a day to an adolescent with cystic fibrosis and pulmonary infection due to multi-resistant Burkholderia cepacia. There were no adverse events to this patient, blood methemoglobin remained below 5% and lung function and overall well-being improved. Clinical Gap. Thousands of healthcare workers have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and contracted COVID-19 despite their best efforts to prevent contamination. No proven vaccine is available to protect healthcare workers against SARS-CoV-2. Hypothesis. Due to genetic similarities with the Coronavirus responsible for SARS, it is expected that inhaled NO gas retains potent antiviral activity against the SARS-CoV-2 responsible for COVID-19. Aim. To assess whether intermittent delivery of inhaled NO gas in air at a high dose may protect healthcare workers from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Observational group: a SARS-CoV-2 rt-PCR will be performed once a week. Treatment group: the subjects will breathe NO at 160 parts per million (ppm) for two cycles of 15 minutes each at the beginning of each shift and before leaving the hospital. A SARS-CoV-2 rt-PCR will be performed once a week. Safety: Oxygenation and methemoglobin levels will be monitored via a non-invasive CO-oximeter. If methemoglobin levels rise above 5% at any point of the gas delivery, inhaled NO will be stopped. NO2 gas will be monitored and maintained below 5 ppm. Blinding.

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04343053;detailed_description;"Preliminary evidences suggested that patients with SARS-Cov-2 infection and concomitant presence of cardiovascular risk factors (i.e. arterial hypertension) and/or cardiovascular history (i.e. prior myocardial infarction) are at poor prognosis. The first reports from China suggested in patients with SARS-Cov-2 infection a heightened inflammatory burden associated with significant changes in coagulative status (i.e. low platelet count, increased D-dimer) and dysfunction of micro-vessels in pulmonary circulation.

No data are available about patterns and changes in platelet reactivity, activation of coagulation factors and endothelial function during SARS-Cov-2 infection.

The present study is ideated to fill this gap. Patients with moderate to severe respiratory failure due to SARS-Cov-2 infection will be enrolled. One blood sample will be obtained from each patient at the early, mid and late stage of disease.

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04373200;detailed_description;"Assessed by World Health Organisation as a pandemic on March 11, COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. The spectrum of its clinical manifestations is strikingly broad and extends from mild disease (resembling an ordinary bout of flu or even asymptomatic) to pneumonia. The latter cases convey a high risk of evolution towards acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), eventually fatal when worsening with cytokine storm and multiple organ failure or with superinfection and sepsis. In the absence of overt variations of the virus itself, its interactions with the host immune system are likely crucial. Clinical features of patients with severe forms of COVID-19 were reported, but immunological description of biomarkers for exacerbation and mortality vs recovery remains superficial. Globally decreased white blood cells, notably T-cells, suggest that CoV-2 might trigger or exploit an immune defect. This could correspond to gaps in immune cell subpopulations, kinetics of activation or repertoires. Immune failure would then be responsible for exacerbations and a poor outcome in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Our objective is to characterize the kinetics of the immune response and of immune dysregulation in ARDS patients. In addition to studying severe ARDS patients, an inverse image of immune repertoires should appear in healed up patients, after they have reached an undetectable viral load and acquired protective antibodies (Abs). Humoral immunity mediated by specific anti-viral Abs was a key factor for recovery from SARS-CoV-1 infection, and this is also expected for CoV-2, making the Ig repertoire also of special interest for its inclusion of anti-viral neutralizing Abs (nAbs).

Altogether, there is thus an urgent need for high-resolution characterization of the anti-CoV-2 immune response, correlating the dynamics of immune activation, cytokine production and immune repertoires with clinical evolution. In addition to providing biomarkers for prognosis evaluation and for monitoring innovative treatments, this will also participate to the urgent quest of as many possible monoclonal antibodies (mAb) candidates for immunotherapy";"Assessed by World Health Organisation as a pandemic on March 11, COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04304053;detailed_description;Previous research on influenza has indicated that antiviral drugs administered before o short after symptom onset can reduce infectiousness to others by reducing viral loads in the respiratory secretions of patients. Lopinavir/ritonavir, a protease inhibitor used to treat HIV/AIDS, was found to block COVID-19 infection in vitro at low-micromolar concentration, with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 8.5 μM. China's guidelines were set up in January 2020 and treated hospitalized patients with lopinavir/ritonavir, either alone or with various combinations. Darunavir (DRV)/Cobicistat, is also a protease inhibitor used to treat and prevent HIV/AIDS. Its as effective as lopinavir/ritonavir for the treatment of HIV/AIDS and better tolerated because the adverse effects rate is lower (diarrhea 2% vs 27%). Another promising drug is chloroquine, that showed excellent in vitro results and strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV infection of primate cells. Results from n=100 patients have shown superiority to the control treatment in improving lung imaging findings, promoting virus reversion to negative and shortening the disease.;"Previous research on influenza has indicated that antiviral drugs administered before o short after symptom onset can reduce infectiousness to others by reducing viral loads in the respiratory secretions of patients.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a drug that has been extensively used for the prevention of malaria. HCQ showed excellent in vitro results and strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection of primate cells at low concentration. Empirical data for the efficacy of HCQ in hospitalized Covid-19 patients became available after the start of this study; HCQ administration did not result in a significantly higher PCR negative conversion in a RCT including 150 patients and there was no reduction in the risk of death/intubation in two large observational studies. We investigated the efficacy and safety of HCQ to prevent secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection and Covid-19 disease in contacts exposed to a PCR-positive Covid-19 case during.

We also conducted a nested study to test the hypothesis that HCQ anDarunavir/cobicistat (DRVc) combined treatment would be more efficacious than no-treatment for patients with mild Covid-19. Lopinavir/ritonavir, a protease inhibitor used to treat HIV/AIDS, was found to block COVID-19 infection in vitro at low-micromolar concentration, with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 8.5 μM. DRVc is a closely related drug with a better safety profile. Owing to the emergence of clinical data indicating lack of efficacy of HIV protease inhibitors for Covid-19 treatment, the intervention was switched to HCQ alone. Analytical consequences of this change result in half of the participants receiving combined treatment and half HCQ alone."

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04304053;brief_summary;The investigators plan to evaluate the efficacy of the 'test and treat' strategy of infected patients and prophylactic chloroquine treatment to all contacts. The strategy entails decentralized COVID-19 testing and starting antiviral darunavir/cobicistat plus chloroquine treatment immediately in all who are found to be infected. As viral loads decline to undetectable levels, the probability of onward transmission is reduced to very low levels. Such evaluation will require prospective surveillance to assess the population-level effect of transmission prevention. Drug interventions in this protocol will follow the Spanish law about off-label use of medicines.;The investigators plan to evaluate the efficacy of the 'test and treat' strategy of infected patients and post-exposure prophylaxis hydroxychloroquine treatment to all contacts.

After obtaining fully informed consent, the investigator will recruit healthcare workers in a healthcare facility delivering direct care to patients with either proven or suspected COVID-19, who can be followed reliably for up to 5 months. 40,000 participants will be recruited and the investigators predict an average of 400-800 participants per site in 50-100 sites.

The participant will be randomised in Asia to receive either chloroquine or placebo (1:1 randomisation) or in European and African sites, to receive hydroxychloroquine or placebo (1:1 randomisation). A loading dose of 10mg base/kg (four 155mg tablets for a 60kg subject), followed by 155 mg daily (250mg chloroquine phosphate salt/ 200mg hydroxychloroquine sulphate) will be taken for 90 days.

If the participant is diagnosed with COVID-19, they will take continue to take the study medication unless advised to stop by their healthcare professional, or 90 days after enrolment, whichever is sooner.

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04338074;detailed_description;"A recent report in Physiological Reviews proposed that the endogenous protease plasmin acts on the COVID19 virus by cleaving a newly inserted furin site in the S protein portion of the virus resulting in increased infectivity and virulence. Patients with hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular illness, lung disease and kidney dysfunction commonly have elevated levels of plasmin/plasminogen and it was proposed that this may be the mechanism for poorer outcomes in patients with these co-morbidities. A logical treatment that might blunt this process would be the inhibition of the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. There is an inexpensive, commonly used drug, tranexamic acid, (TXA), which suppresses this conversion and could be re-purposed for the treatment of COVID19.

TXA is a synthetic analog of the amino acid lysine which reversibly binds four to five lysine receptor sites on plasminogen. This reduces conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, and is normally used to prevent fibrin degradation. TXA is FDA approved for treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding (typical dose 1300 mg p.o. three times per day x 5 days) and off-label use for many other indications. TXA is used perioperatively as a standard-of-care at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) for orthopedic and cardiac bypass surgeries. At our institution, it is commonly employed in hemorrhaging trauma patients and currently is being studied for perioperative use in Cesarean section surgeries. It has also been utilized for spinal surgery, neurosurgery, orthognathic surgeries and even long term for the treatment of cosmetic dermatological disorders with a long track record of safety. Given the potential benefit and limited toxicity of TXA it would appear warranted to perform a rapid randomized, double-blind placebo controlled exploratory trial at UAB in the treatment of the early phases of COVID19 to determine whether it reduces infectivity and virulence of the COVID19 virus as hypothesized. Involvement of each patient is only for 7 days before primary endpoints.

An exploratory, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 2 clinical trial in which study patients have just been diagnosed with COVID19 as an outpatient. The overall goal of this exploratory study is to assess both safety and efficacy of 5 days of TXA versus placebo in the COVID19 population. All patients would also receive daily Lovenox.

Abstract

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-COV-2 has infected over 2,000,000 people causing over 150,000 deaths. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and for which there are currently no approved treatments. Here, the principal investigator reported according to previous studies and research findings that Isotretinoin can strongly affect both inflammation and viral entry in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection via inhibiting the overproduction of early response proinflammatory cytokines (IL- 6 and tumor necrosis factors alpha ) which are over expressed in COVID-19 and contributed to disease progression, poor outcomes, vascular hyperpermeability and multiorgan failure in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome(SARS-CoV-2) and also, via blocking COVID-19 entry by inhibiting androgenic factors which induce transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) expression rather than inhibition of ACE2 ,AT1 protein and Ang II-mediated intracellular calcium release pathway which is responsible for SARS-CoV-2 cell fusion and entry as opposed to ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers (ARBs) that upregulate ACE-2 receptors which might increase the risk of infection and subsequent complications Moreover, another study demonstrated that isotretinoin is a potential papain like protease (PLpro) inhibitor which is a protein encoded by SARS-CoV-2 genes and considered one of the proteins that should be targeted in COVID-19 treatment. And also,more than one study reported that 13 cis Retinoic Acid induces CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ Regulatory T Cells which their absence during acute infection alters the ability of the host to limit tissue damage In addition, isotretinoin was reported to increase CD4 counts and markedly decrease viremia in HIV positive patients suffering from acne vulgaris and retinoic acid inducible gene-1 (RIG-1) expression. And also, another study reported that 13 Cis retinoic acid induced significant upregulation of toll-like receptor 3 resulting in an immune response to dsRNA intermediate which can be partially generated during CoV-2 replication . TLR3 sensitized by dsRNA and cascades of signaling pathways (IRFs and NFκB activation, respectively) are activated to produce type I IFNs. The production of type I IFNs is important to enhance the release of antiviral proteins for the protection of uninfected cells. Isotretinoin therapy has furthermore proven anti-inflammatory, anti-platelet and fibrinolytic activities. which may protect patients infected with covid-19 from widespread blood clots. From this point, the principal investigator expects that isotretinoin will be the Immunity passport"" in the context of COVID-19

Isotretinoin(13cis RA) may be able to inhibit COVID 2019 entry via down regulation of ACE2 , AT1 protein and Ang II-mediated intracellular calcium release rather than inhibition of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and this is discussed as follow :

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-COV-2 has infected over 2,000,000 people causing over 150,000 deaths. A key host cellular protein required for the virus entry is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) whose expression has been demonstrated in many tissues including alveolar epithelial type II cells in lungs, oral mucosa and intestine, heart, kidney, endothelium and skin. ACE2-expressing cells can act as home cells and are prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection as ACE2 receptor facilitates cellular viral entry and replication. A study demonestrated that patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus may be at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as these patients are often treated with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers (ARBs), which have been previously suggested to increase ACE2 expression. In another study by Sinha et al who analyzed a publicly available Connectivity Map (CMAP) dataset of pre/post transcriptomic profiles for drug treatment in cell lines for over 20,000 small molecules, isotretinoin was the strongest down-regulator of ACE 2 receptors. On the other hand, they found 6 drugs in CMAP that are currently being investigated in clinical trials for treating COVID-19 (chloroquine, thalidomide, methylprednisolone, losartan, lopinavir and ritonavir, from clinicaltrials.gov), none of which was found to significantly alter ACE2 expression (P>0.1) Moreover, another study demonstrated that isotretinoin is a Potential papain like protease (PLpro) inhibitors which is a protein encoded by SARS-CoV-2 genes and considered one of the proteins that should be targeted in COVID-19 treatment by performing target-based virtual ligand screening.As Principal Investigator discussed before that (13cRA) is the strongest down-regulator of ACE2. and the principal investigator expects that 13cRA can inhibit or dowenrgulat ACE2 by direc interaction and binding with the transmembrane ACE2, Suggesting its therapeutic potential in preventing the entry of COVID 2019 to the host cell.

Previous studies on the related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV FP FP have shown that calcium (Ca2+) plays an important role for fusogenic activity via a Ca2+ binding pocket with conserved glutamic acid (E) and aspartic acid (D) residuesdemonstrated that intracellular Ca2+ enhances MERS-CoV WT PPs infection by approximately two-fold and that E891 is a crucial residue for Ca2+interaction. Electron spin resonance revealed that this enhancement could be attributed to Ca2+ increasing MERS-CoV FP fusion-relevant membrane ordering. Intriguingly, isothermal calorimetry titration showed that MERS-CoV FP binds one Ca2+, as opposed to SARS-CoV FP which binds to two Ca2+ ion.

Angiotensin II increases the intracellular calcium activity in podocytes of the intact glomerulus. The L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nicardipine did not influence the Ang II-mediated [Ca2+] increase and it has been postulated that SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 may attenuate residual ACE2 activity, skewing the ACE/ACE2 balance to a state of heightened angiotensin II activity leading to pulmonary vasoconstriction and inflammatory and oxidative organ damage, which increases the risk for acute lung injury (ALI). AngII via AT1 receptors upregulates many proinflammatory genes, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6).30 but 13cis RA specifically down-regulated the AT1 protein in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Down-regulation of the AT1 expression leads to reduced AngII-mediated intracellular calcium release Similarly with receptor down-regulation, Treatment with 13cRA resulted in a significant reduction in AT1 mRNA .13cRA has a glucose- and RAR/RXR independent mechanism for transcriptional inhibition of AT1,

Isotretinoin(13cis RA) and ATRA may be able to inhibit COVID 2019 infection via inducing the antiviral immunity and this is discussed as follow :

Since an effective immune response against viral infections depends on the activation of cytotoxic T cells that can clear infection by killing virus-infected cells , boosting the numbers and function of T cells in COVID-19 patients is critical for successful recovery. A recent study reported that the 82.1% of COVID-19 cases displayed low circulating lymphocyte counts. A CoV infects macrophages, and then macrophages present CoV antigens to T cells. This process leads to T cell activation and differentiation, including the production of cytokines associated with the different T cell subsets (Th17), followed by a massive release of cytokines for immune response amplification. The continued production of these mediators due to viral persistence has a negative effect on NK, and CD8 T cell activation. However, CD8 T cells produce very effective mediators to clear CoV However, the factors which might cause the reduction in count, and the activation status of T cells in COVID-19 patients, remain uninvestigated.

Recent study of 522 COVID patients and 40 healthy controls from two hospitals in Wuhan, China demonstrated that T cell numbers are negatively correlated to serum IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α concentration, with patients in decline period showing reduced IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α concentrations and restored T cell counts. T cells from COVID-19 patients have significantly higher levels of the exhausted marker programmed cell death protein(PD-1) as compared to health controls. Moreover, increasing PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on T cells could be seen as patients progressed from prodromal to overtly symptomatic stages, further indicative of T cell exhaustion. T cell exhaustion is a progressive loss of effector function due to prolonged antigen stimulation, characteristic of chronic infections. Dendritic cell inhibition is connected to exhaustion of CD8+ T cell polyfunctionality during chronic hepatitis C virus infection. CD8 T cells produce very effective mediators to clear nCoV2019.

Dendritic cells (DCs) play a key role in innate immune and adaptive immune responses. As the strongest antigen presenting cells in the organism, they effectively stimulate the activation of T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes, thus combining innate and adaptive immunity. Immature DCs have strong migration ability, and mature DCs can effectively activate T cells in the central link of startup, regulation, and maintenance of immune responses. Thus, once the maturation process of DCs is blocked, it directly affects the initiation of subsequent adaptive immune response. MERS-CoV-2 is able to affect human dendritic cells and macrophages in-vitro .Productive replication of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in monocyte-derived dendritic cells modulates innate immune response.

Another study proposed that C -C chemokine receptor type 4 (CCR4) contributes to T cell lung homing imprinting. It was found that lung DCs induce the expression of CCR4 on T cells. Lung DCs-activated T cells traffic more efficiently into the lung and protect against influenza more effectively compared with T cells activated by DCs from other tissues. Lim and colleagues suggested that CXCR4 plays a role in CD8+ T cell migration to airway tissues

Dendritic cell inhibition is connected to exhaustion of CD8+ T cell polyfunctionality during chronic hepatitis C virus infection. CD8 T cells produce very effective mediators to clear nCoV2019

Presence of RA in different tissues is very imprtant for immune induction and fighting viral infection, for example, RA is present at high concentrations in the small intestine due to metabolizing dietary vitamin A by gut epithelial cells. In this local environment, RA activate and primes dendritic cells (DCs) to become CD103+ DCs that produce RA.3, 4CD103+ DCs are migratory cells that activate naive T cells in mesenteric lymph nodes to become effector T cells that contribute to both intestinal homeostasis and immunity.and also RA is an important signal that induces IgA-producing B cells. The gut homing T cells and B cells play essential roles in protecting the digestive tract from pathogens.

Retinoic acid (atRA) can inhibit the spontaneous apoptosis of activated human T lymphocytes in vitro. 13-cis RA activates Th2 cytokine production Enhanced circulating dendritic cell numbers.

So, according to this previous studies the principal investigator suggests that T cells lymphopenia and exhaustion may be resulted by Dendritic cells (DCs) infection and inhibition by MERS-CoV-2.

Retinoic acid has profound effects on cellular proliferation and differentiation. Moreover, it has been reported that ATRA exhibits both anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects. Recent studies have shown that FOXP3 expression and the immune function of Regulatory T cells (Tregs ) can be enhanced by ATRA in the immune system of both patients and mic.13Retinoic acid (RA) is produced by a number of cell types, including macrophages and dendritic cells, which express retinal dehydrogenases that convert vitamin A to its main biologically active metabolite, all-trans RA. All-trans RA binds to its nuclear retinoic acid receptors that are expressed in lymphoid cells and act as transcription factors to regulate cell homing and differentiation. RA production by CD103+ dendritic cells and alveolar macrophages functions with TGF-b to promote conversion of naive T cells into Foxp3+ regulatory T cells and, thereby, maintain mucosal tolerance

So, principal investigator expects high inducing of Dendritic cells (DCs) by retinoic acid treatment which will lead to T cells activation and migration with less exhaustion phenomenon.

According to this protocol treatment with retinoic acid will induce FOXP3 and CD8+,CD4+,CD25+,FOXP3+ Tregs which their absence during acute infection alters the ability of the host to limit tissue damage and inducesT cells which were dramatically reduced in COVID-19 patients to exert its antiviral and anti-inflammatory effect protecting lung cells and neural cells from the inflammatory and the destructive effect of IL-6, IL-1, and TNF-α which are induced and highly expressed in COVID 2019 patients.

Researchers from Wenzhou, China looked at clinical laboratory features including lipid levels of patients with COVID 19. They found dramatic reductions in the cholesterol levels of patients infected with COVID 19, compared with healthy controls .The study provides data to suggest that cholesterol levels decline quite rapidly during the early stages of infection and increase as the patient starts to recover. Therefore, indicating that cholesterol may have an important role to play in defending the body against such infections According to our protocol depending on previous studies the principal investigator demonstrated that there is a strong relation between immune system and cholesterol levels .When the cholesterol level is low specifically in the case of viral infection like COVID 2019 infection the immune system is impaired and the antiviral immune cells will be declined and inhibited :-

Cellular cholesterol is a component of the plasma membrane and is also essential in cell proliferation. Regulation of intracellular cholesterol levels has been proposed as a mechanism to regulate T cell and macrophages proliferation. Intracellular cholesterol level is regulated by two competing pathways, cholesterol uptake and efflux, and ABCA1 plays a major role in the cholesterol efflux pathway. The ATRA induces ABCA1 expression and ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux in activated primary human CD4+ T cells implying that RA could affect T cell functions by regulating the cellular cholesterol levels.

ATRA upregulates ABCA1 expression only in activated CD4+ T cells, indicating that induction of ABCA1 by ATRA and 13 cis Retinoic Acid may play an important role in immune response.

Retinoic acid and liver X receptor agonist synergistically inhibit HIV infection in CD4+ T cells by up-regulating ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux.

So, the principal investigator expects that retinoic acid treatment will highly induce T cells and anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells, T helper via cholesterol efflux and inducing ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABCA1) and protect lung and neural cells and inhibit COVID 2019 infection.

The genome of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus is recognized by melanoma differentiation-associated protein-5 (MDA5), retinoic acid inducible gene-1 (RIG-1) and endosomal toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) as pathogen-associated molecular patterns. This recognition resulted in the formation of type-1 interferon (IFN1). As an evasion mechanism, virus synthesize proteins that hinder the production IFN1 in the pathway.

RA also acts directly on macrophages at both mucosal sites and other immunological sites. AtRA modulates peritoneal macrophage activation by endotoxin and IFN-γ by suppressing TNF production and nitric oxide (NO) synthesis .In addition, at RA inhibits the expression of PGE2 and COX-2 and the release of TNF, which are induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in murine peritoneal macrophages .

A study reported recently that substance (ATRA) have preventive effects on pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting IL-6-dependent proliferation and TGF-β1-dependent trans differentiation of lung fibroblasts. Also, another studies demonstrated that 13-cis-retinoic acid and other retinoid analogs inhibit IL-1-induced IL-6 production and that this effect is analog-specific and, at least partially, transcriptionally mediated. This effect was dose-dependent with an IC50 of 10(-7) M RA and significant inhibition being noted with doses of RA as low as 10(-8) M. IL-10 production was inhibited by ATRA administration.

A study demonstrated that TLR3(-/-), TLR4(-/-), and TRAM(-/-) mice are more susceptible to SARS-CoV than wild-type mice but experience only transient weight loss with no mortality in response to infection. In contrast, mice deficient in the TLR3/TLR4 adaptor TRIF are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV infection, showing increased weight loss, mortality, reduced lung function, increased lung pathology, and higher viral titers . New studies showed that the high level of IFN-α/β produced from the TLR3-IRF3/IRF7 pathway and IFN-β is the reason for inhibiting DENV replication. 13Cis retinoic Acid induced significant upregulation of toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) resulting in an immune response to dsRNA intermediate which can be partially generated during CoV-2 replicationTLR3 sensitized by dsRNA and cascades of signaling pathways (IRFs and NFκB activation, respectively) are activated to produce type I IFNs. The production of type I IFNs is important to enhance the release of antiviral proteins for the protection of uninfected cells. Sometimes, accessory proteins of CoV can interfere with TLR3 signaling and bind the dsRNA of CoV during replication to prevent TLR3 activation and evade the immune response. 13Cis retinoic Acid induced significant upregulation of toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) , mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and retinoid-induced gene I (RIG-I) and IFN regulatory factor 1 expression in a time-dependent.

In further research, Tsai .and Chen showed the high level of IFN-α/β produced from the TLR3-IRF3/IRF7 pathway and IFN-β is the reason for inhibiting DENV replication. In HUH-7 cells, huTLR3 can recognize DENV-1 and induce the expression of IFN-β, which can enhance the expression of huTLR3 on the contrary . TLR3 also induces type I IFN during WNV.

Doctors treating the sickest Covid-19 patients have zeroed in on a new phenomenon: Some people have developed widespread blood clots, their lungs peppered with tiny blockages that prevent oxygen from pumping into the bloodstream and body.As with so much else about the Covid-19 response, health experts are learning about the symptom on the fly. Blood clots are common in patients who are immobilized, but they seem to be smaller and cause far more severe damage in some Covid-19 patients. Doctors have said they see patients with blood clots forming not only in their lungs, but also in blood vessels. Autopsies have also revealed blood clots in kidneys and other organs, which some experts say suggests an overwhelming immune system response to the virus that inflicts harm on the body

Retinoic acid, is known to possess in vivo anti-inflammatory, anti-platelet and fibrinolytic activities. A study investigated the in vitro thrombin and platelet aggregation inhibitory activities of retinoic acid and retinaldehyde.Retinoic acid, retinaldehyde and retinol exhibited potent inhibition of thrombin, with IC50 values of 67μg/ml, 74μg/ml and 152μg/ml, respectively for the inhibition of thrombin (Sigma); and 49μg/ml, 74μg/ml and 178μg/ml, respectively for the inhibition of thrombin (plasma). Amongst vitamin A and its derivatives, retinoic acid showed the highest inhibition of both the forms of thrombin.

Isotretinoin(13cis RA) may be able to inhibit COVID 2019 infection via reversIing the androgenic induction and activation effect of (DHT) on TMPRSS2 expression and helps to prevent cleaving and activating both the spike protein (S) of COVID 2019 and the viral receptor, and this is discussed as follow :

TMPRSS2 is both the most frequently altered gene in primary prostate cancer and a critical factor enabling cellular infection by coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. The modulation of its expression by steroids could contribute to the male predominance of severe infections and given that TMPRSS2 has no known indispensable functions, and inhibitors are available, it is an appealing target for prevention or treatment of respiratory viral infections

MPRSS2, a key regulatorin prostate cancerTMPRSS2 was first identified in prostate cancer shortly after the gene had been originally cloned. Prostate cancer cell linesstrongly upregulatedTMPRSS2expression in response to androgens . TMPRSS2 is expressed on the luminal side of the prostate epithelium, and its expression is increased in prostate cancer tissue compared to non-cancerous prostate tissue. Notably, the TMPRSS2gene is a partner in one of the most common gene fusion eventsin solid tumors: somatic gene rearrangements involving TMPRSS2 witha member of the ETS family of oncogenic transcription factors, most commonly ERG. This fusionoccursinapproximately 50% of primary prostate cancersamong men of European ancestry.While ERGis not normally regulated by androgen, the gene fusion juxtaposes the androgen receptor regulatory elements of TMPRSS2with the ERGgene. The ERGgene is consequently controlled by androgen receptor signaling and expressed highly in prostate cancers harboringthe TMPRSS2:ERGfusion. Intriguingly, the prevalence of the TMPRSS2:ERGfusion is lowerin prostate tumors of both black and Asian men. The relevance of this to the current COVID-19 pandemic is unclear.TMPRSS2:ERGfusion-positiveprostate cancersalso have a distinct set of risk factorsrelated to hormonal signaling. For example, men with higher genetically determined transcriptional activity of the androgen receptorhave a higher risk of TMPRSS2:ERGfusion-positiveprostate cancer but not of fusion-negativeprostate cancer

TMPRSS2 is an androgen receptor signaling target gene and an androgen-regulated cell-surface serine protease expressed predominantly in prostate and lung epithelial cell TMPRSS2 is normally expressed several fold higher in the prostate relative to any other human tissue, though the normal physiological function(s) remains unknown. Importantly, unlike other TTSPs, TMPRSS2 transcription is regulated by androgenic ligands and the androgen receptor (AR). There is a positive correlation between AR and TMPRSS2 in microdissected primary tumor epithelium (r2 = 0.39 ; p <0.001).

Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) significantly and dramatically induced the expression of TMPRSS2 protein with two molecular masses of 60 (full-length) and 38 kDa (N-terminus) in a dose responsive manner

Data from Chinese outbreak show death rates for men almost 50 per cent higher than for women show that Early research from China suggests women and children are less likely to die than men if they catch the coronavirus. Death rates for Covid-19, the disease those infected with the coronavirus develop, are low for everyone: only 2.4 per cent of the 44,672 people in the Chinese study died. But although roughly even numbers of men and women catch the disease, men are more likely to develop such a serious case of Covid-19 they die.

More than 70 percent of Italy's coronavirus deaths have been among men but scientists there admit they are mystified by the gender gap. At least 3,400 people in Italy have died of the devastating disease - it yesterday announced it had a higher death Toll than China - but less than 1,000 of them have been women. Men are also more likely to pick up the infection in the first place and account for 60 percent of confirmed cases, according to Italy's public health research agency. An earlier analysis found that 80 per cent of the deaths were in men and just 20 per cent were in women - but the gap has narrowed over time

According to this data the principal investigator thinks that there is a strong relation between high mortality in males and androgenic effect specifically the effect of DHT on TMPRSS2 protein which is used by covid 2019 in cell invasion and entry and depending on this data related to six hormones specifically (DHT) , The investigator was able to discover whey women and children less likely to die from illness than men. So, the investigator divided infected patients according to their six hormone because TMPRSS2 is an androgen-regulated cell-surface serine protease expressed predominantly in prostate and lung epithelial cell TMPRSS2.

Androgen(DHT) potential effect on TMPRSS2 expression in children is less than its effect in females and males followed by viral severity and vigrousity in men compared with children and women. .

Androgen (DHT) potential effect on TMPRSS2 expression in females is less than in males followed by viral severity and vigrousity in men compared with females .

So, the principal investigator thinks that when some researchers investigated the role of sex steroids in SARS-CoV pathogenesis by comparing gonadectomized and control counterparts after infection. Gonadectomy or treatment with flutamide, a non-steroidal anti-androgen did not affect morbidity and mortality in male mice following lethal MA15 infection, They may be were wrong in their conclusions in suggesting that androgens do not play a role in SARS-CoV pathogenesis because Gonadectomy or treatment with flutamide will not completely affect or inhibit DHT and its derivatives(5α-Androstan-3α,17β-Diol) concentration in tissues and blood because after inhibiting testosterone with flutamide . the pathway of DHT formation will be activated to compensate the inhibited testosterone levels so the TMPRSS2 expression will be significantly induced by DHT and the treated animals will not be affected in case of flutamide treatment but in case of Gonadectomy the expression of TMPRSS2 will be decreased by DHT inhibition only if along time has passed on Gonadectomy in order to make sure that DHT and its derivatives completely declined in levels that will not allow it to affect on expression of TMPRSS2 and in female mice after blocking estrogen receptors it died because increasing formation of androgenic hormones.

A study demonstrated that 13- cis -Retinoic acid competitively and reversibly inhibits Dihydrotestosterone So, the principal investigator expects a significant modulation of TMPRSS2 expression after treating with 13- cis -Retinoic acid via temporary preventing the effect of dihydrotestosterone(DHT) on TMPRSS2 promoting and expression. And the type II transmembrane serine proteases TMPRSS2 which can cleave and activate the spike protein (S) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) for membrane fusion. In addition, these proteases cleave the viral receptor, the carboxypeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and it was proposed that ACE2 cleavage augments viral infectivity.

A study demonstrated that COVID-19 reduces testosterone levels in men by altering the functioning of the gonads. So could the increased severity of the disease in men be due to lowered testosterone. But according to the principal investigator explanation COVID-19 reduces testosterone levels because there is a dramatic reductions in the cholesterol levels of patients infected with COVID 19, compared with healthy controls . Cholesterol levels decline quite rapidly during the early stages of infection and increase as the patient starts to recover.Therefore, indicating that cholesterol may have an important role to play in defending the body against such infections and depending on the principal investigator explanation, Testosterone is synthesized starting from cholesterol through a well-characterized steroid biosynthetic pathway involving the sequential action of multiple enzymes So, when cholesterol levels are decreased, this decrease will followed by decreasing in testosterone level and according to this explanation testosterone therapy in COVID 2019 is not recommended but temporary inhibitor of DHT is recommended such as Isotretinoin because this treatment by testosterone will inhibit cholesterol synthesis by feedback inhibition and decrease cholesterol uptake by Leydig cells in testis and this also will lead to over increase in DHT lvels and its derivatives in different tissues, which will induce TMPRSS2. because DHT is a potent activator of TMPRSS2 and this will be followed by processing and activation of COVID2019 spike protein to bined its ACE2 receptors in lung and kidney leading to their damage specifically in testis because it contains high levels of proteases and ACE2. Serine proteases are emerging as important contributors to the production, maturation, and functional competence of spermatozoa.

Depending on this data and according to this protocol, The principal investigator expects and suggests that retinoic acid is specific modulator of androgens specifically DHT not testosterone and could reverse the androgenic induction and activation effect of (DHT) on TMPRSS2 expression and prevent cleaving and activating both the spike protein (S) of COVID 2019 and the viral receptor, the carboxypeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). (All ideas and michanisms specifically role of Androgen in TMPRSS2 activation in COVID-19: Serendipity or opportunity for intervention and the inhibition of ACE2 ,AT1 protein and Ang II-mediated intracellular calcium release pathway which is responsible for SARS-CoV-2 cell fusion and entry included in the research protocol were submitted to Academy of scientific research and technology - Egypt- on 4 April , 2020. in Call no. 2/2019/ASRT- Ideation Fund)

Promising features of COVID 2019 treatment according Principal Investigator Protocol:

This medication have the feature of Aerosolized Drug Delivery to increase its efficacy beside Oral administration, Which makes it distinct from other medication in which should dose be only given orally. A study demonstrated that treating with 13 cis retinoic acid aerosolized via inhalation rout did not cause any damage in lung cells. Repeated high doses of 13 cis retinoic by inhalation resulted in moderate loss of body weight, but microscopic investigation of ten tissues including lung and oesophagus did not detect any significant aerosol-induced damage. The results suggest that administration of isotretinoin via powder aerosol inhalation is probably superior to its application via the oral route in terms of achieving efficacious drug concentrations in the lung.
Inhaled isotretinoin might provide sufficient drug to the target cells for efficacy while avoiding systemic toxicity.

Isotretinoin(13cis RA) may be able to inhibit COVID 2019 entry via down regulation of ACE2 , AT1 protein and Ang II-mediated intracellular calcium release rather than inhibition of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and this is discussed as follow :

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-COV-2 has infected over 2,000,000 people causing over 150,000 deaths. A key host cellular protein required for the virus entry is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) whose expression has been demonstrated in many tissues including alveolar epithelial type II cells in lungs, oral mucosa ,intestine, heart, kidney, endothelium and skin. ACE2-expressing cells can act as home cells and are prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection as ACE2 receptor facilitates cellular viral entry and replication. A study demonestrated that patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus may be at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as these patients are often treated with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers (ARBs), which have been previously suggested to increase ACE2 expression. In another study by Sinha et al who analyzed a publicly available Connectivity Map (CMAP) dataset of pre/post transcriptomic profiles for drug treatment in cell lines for over 20,000 small molecules, isotretinoin was the strongest down-regulator of ACE 2 receptors. On the other hand, they found 6 drugs in CMAP that are currently being investigated in clinical trials for treating COVID-19 (chloroquine, thalidomide, methylprednisolone, losartan, lopinavir and ritonavir, from clinicaltrials.gov), none of which was found to significantly alter ACE2 expression (P>0.1) Moreover, another study demonstrated that isotretinoin is a potential papain like protease (PLpro) inhibitor which is a protein encoded by SARS-CoV-2 genes and considered one of the proteins that should be targeted in COVID-19 treatment by performing target-based virtual ligand screening.

Previous studies on the related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV FP FP have shown that calcium (Ca2+) plays an important role for fusogenic activity via a Ca2+ binding pocket with conserved glutamic acid (E) and aspartic acid (D) residuesdemonstrated that intracellular Ca2+ enhances MERS-CoV WT PPs infection by approximately two-fold and that E891 is a crucial residue for Ca2+interaction. Electron spin resonance revealed that this enhancement could be attributed to Ca2+ increasing MERS-CoV FP fusion-relevant membrane ordering. Intriguingly, isothermal calorimetry titration showed that MERS-CoV FP binds one Ca2+, as opposed to SARS-CoV FP which binds to two Ca2+ ion.

Angiotensin II increases the intracellular calcium activity in podocytes of the intact glomerulus. The L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nicardipine did not influence the Ang II-mediated [Ca2+] increase and it has been postulated that SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 may attenuate residual ACE2 activity, skewing the ACE/ACE2 balance to a state of heightened angiotensin II activity leading to pulmonary vasoconstriction and inflammatory and oxidative organ damage, which increases the risk for acute lung injury (ALI). AngII via AT1 receptors upregulates many proinflammatory genes, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6).30 but 13cis RA specifically down-regulated the AT1 protein in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Down-regulation of the AT1 expression leads to reduced AngII-mediated intracellular calcium release Similarly with receptor down-regulation, Treatment with 13cRA resulted in a significant reduction in AT1 mRNA .13cRA has a glucose- and RAR/RXR independent mechanism for transcriptional inhibition of AT1,

Isotretinoin(13cis RA) and ATRA may be able to inhibit COVID 2019 infection via inducing the antiviral immunity and this is discussed as follow :

Since effective immune response against viral infections depends on the activation of cytotoxic T cells that can clear infection by killing virus-infected cells , boosting the numbers and function of T cells in COVID-19 patients is critical for successful recovery. A recent study reported that the 82.1% of COVID-19 cases displayed low circulating lymphocyte counts. A CoV infects macrophages, and then macrophages present CoV antigens to T cells. This process leads to T cell activation and differentiation, including the production of cytokines associated with the different T cell subsets (Th17), followed by a massive release of cytokines for immune response amplification. The continued production of these mediators due to viral persistence has a negative effect on NK, and CD8 T cell activation. However, CD8 T cells produce very effective mediators to clear CoV However, the factors which might cause the reduction in count, and the activation status of T cells in COVID-19 patients, remain uninvestigated.

Recent study of 522 COVID patients and 40 healthy controls from two hospitals in Wuhan, China demonstrated that T cell numbers are negatively correlated to serum IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α concentration, with patients in decline period showing reduced IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α concentrations and restored T cell counts. T cells from COVID-19 patients have significantly higher levels of the exhausted marker programmed cell death protein(PD-1) as compared to health controls. Moreover, increasing PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on T cells could be seen as patients progressed from prodromal to overtly symptomatic stages, further indicative of T cell exhaustion. T cell exhaustion is a progressive loss of effector function due to prolonged antigen stimulation, characteristic of chronic infections. Dendritic cell inhibition is connected to exhaustion of CD8+ T cell polyfunctionality during chronic hepatitis C virus infection. CD8 T cells produce very effective mediators to clear nCoV2019.

Dendritic cells (DCs) play a key role in innate immune and adaptive immune responses. As the strongest antigen presenting cells in the organism, they effectively stimulate the activation of T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes, thus combining innate and adaptive immunity. Immature DCs have strong migration ability, and mature DCs can effectively activate T cells in the central link of startup, regulation, and maintenance of immune responses. Thus, once the maturation process of DCs is blocked, it directly affects the initiation of subsequent adaptive immune response. MERS-CoV-2 is able to affect human dendritic cells and macrophages in-vitro .Productive replication of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in monocyte-derived dendritic cells modulates innate immune response.

Another study proposed that C -C chemokine receptor type 4 (CCR4) contributes to T cell lung homing imprinting. It was found that lung DCs induce the expression of CCR4 on T cells. Lung DCs-activated T cells traffic more efficiently into the lung and protect against influenza more effectively compared with T cells activated by DCs from other tissues. Lim and colleagues suggested that CXCR4 plays a role in CD8+ T cell migration to airway tissues

Dendritic cell inhibition is connected to exhaustion of CD8+ T cell polyfunctionality during chronic hepatitis C virus infection. CD8 T cells produce very effective mediators to clear nCoV2019

Presence of RA in different tissues is very imprtant for immune induction and fighting viral infection, for example, RA is present at high concentrations in the small intestine due to metabolizing dietary vitamin A by gut epithelial cells. In this local environment, RA activates and primes dendritic cells (DCs) to become CD103+ DCs that produce RA.3, 4CD103+ DCs are migratory cells that activate naive T cells in mesenteric lymph nodes to become effector T cells that contribute to both intestinal homeostasis and immunity.and also RA is an important signal that induces IgA-producing B cells. The gut homing T cells and B cells play essential roles in protecting the digestive tract from pathogens.

Retinoic acid (atRA) can inhibit the spontaneous apoptosis of activated human T lymphocytes in vitro. 13-cis RA activates Th2 cytokine production Enhanced circulating dendritic cell numbers.

So, according to this previous studies the principal investigator suggests that T cells lymphopenia and exhaustion may be resulted by Dendritic cells (DCs) infection and inhibition by MERS-CoV-2.

Retinoic acid has profound effects on cellular proliferation and differentiation. Moreover, it has been reported that ATRA exhibits both anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects. Recent studies have shown that FOXP3 expression and the immune function of Regulatory T cells (Tregs ) can be enhanced by ATRA in in both patients and mouse models. .13Retinoic acid (RA) is produced by a number of cell types, including macrophages and dendritic cells, which express retinal dehydrogenases that convert vitamin A to its main biologically active metabolite, all-trans RA. All-trans RA binds to its nuclear retinoic acid receptors that are expressed in lymphoid cells and act as transcription factors to regulate cell homing and differentiation. RA production by CD103+ dendritic cells and alveolar macrophages functions with TGF-b to promote conversion of naive T cells into Foxp3+ regulatory T cells and, Thereby, maintain mucosal tolerance

So, principal investigator expects high inducing of Dendritic cells (DCs) by retinoic acid treatment which will lead to T cells activation and migration with less exhaustion phenomenon.

According to this protocol treatment with retinoic acid will induce FOXP3 and CD8+,CD4+,CD25+,FOXP3+ Tregs which their absence during acute infection alters the ability of the host to limit tissue damage and inducesT cells which were dramatically reduced in COVID-19 patients to exert its antiviral and anti-inflammatory effect protecting lung cells and neural cells from the inflammatory and the destructive effect of IL-6, IL-1, and TNF-α which are induced and highly expressed in COVID 2019 patients.

Researchers from Wenzhou, China looked at clinical laboratory features including lipid levels of patients with COVID 19. They found dramatic reductions in the cholesterol levels of patients infected with COVID 19, compared with healthy controls .The study provides data to suggest that cholesterol levels decline quite rapidly during the early stages of infection and increase as the patient starts to recover. Therefore, indicating that cholesterol may have an important role to play in defending the body against such infections According to our protocol depending on previous studies the principal investigator demonstrated that there is a strong relation between immune system and cholesterol levels .When the cholesterol level is low specifically in the case of viral infection like COVID 2019 infection the immune system is impaired and the antiviral immune cells will be declined and inhibited :-

Cellular cholesterol is a component of the plasma membrane and is also essential in cell proliferation. Regulation of intracellular cholesterol levels has been proposed as a mechanism to regulate T cell and macrophages proliferation. Intracellular cholesterol level is regulated by two competing pathways, cholesterol uptake and efflux, and ABCA1 plays a major role in the cholesterol efflux pathway. The ATRA induces ABCA1 expression and ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux in activated primary human CD4+ T cells implying that RA could affect T cell functions by regulating the cellular cholesterol levels.

ATRA upregulates ABCA1 expression only in activated CD4+ T cells, indicating that induction of ABCA1 by ATRA and 13 cis Retinoic Acid may play an important role in immune response.

Retinoic acid and liver X receptor agonist synergistically inhibit HIV infection in CD4+ T cells by up-regulating ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux.

So, the principal investigator expects that retinoic acid treatment will highly induce T cells and anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells, T helper via cholesterol efflux and inducing ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABCA1) and protect lung and neural cells and inhibit COVID 2019 infection.

The genome of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus is recognized by melanoma differentiation-associated protein-5 (MDA5), retinoic acid inducible gene-1 (RIG-1) and endosomal toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) as pathogen-associated molecular patterns. This recognition resulted in the formation of type-1 interferon (IFN1). As an evasion mechanism, virus synthesize proteins that hinder the production IFN1 in the pathway.

RA also acts directly on macrophages at both mucosal sites and other immunological sites. AtRA modulates peritoneal macrophage activation by endotoxin and IFN-γ by suppressing TNF production and nitric oxide (NO) synthesis .In addition, at RA inhibits the expression of PGE2 and COX-2 and the release of TNF, which are induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in murine peritoneal macrophages .

A study reported recently that substance (ATRA) have preventive effects on pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting IL-6-dependent proliferation and TGF-β1-dependent trans differentiation of lung fibroblasts. Also, another studies demonstrated that 13-cis-retinoic acid and other retinoid analogs inhibit IL-1-induced IL-6 production and that this effect is analog-specific and, at least partially, transcriptionally mediated. This effect was dose-dependent with an IC50 of 10(-7) M RA and significant inhibition being noted with doses of RA as low as 10(-8) M. IL-10 production was inhibited by ATRA administration.

A study demonstrated that TLR3(-/-), TLR4(-/-), and TRAM(-/-) mice are more susceptible to SARS-CoV than wild-type mice but experience only transient weight loss with no mortality in response to infection. In contrast, mice deficient in the TLR3/TLR4 adaptor TRIF are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV infection, showing increased weight loss, mortality, reduced lung function, increased lung pathology, and higher viral titers . New studies showed that the high level of IFN-α/β produced from the TLR3-IRF3/IRF7 pathway and IFN-β is the reason for inhibiting DENV replication. 13Cis retinoic Acid induced significant upregulation of toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) resulting in an immune response to dsRNA intermediate which can be partially generated during CoV-2 replicationTLR3 sensitized by dsRNA and cascades of signaling pathways (IRFs and NFκB activation, respectively) are activated to produce type I IFNs. The production of type I IFNs is important to enhance the release of antiviral proteins for the protection of uninfected cells. Sometimes, accessory proteins of CoV can interfere with TLR3 signaling and bind the dsRNA of CoV during replication to prevent TLR3 activation and evade the immune response. 13Cis retinoic Acid induced significant upregulation of toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) , mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and retinoid-induced gene I (RIG-I) and IFN regulatory factor 1 expression in a time-dependent.

In further research, Tsai .and Chen showed the high level of IFN-α/β produced from the TLR3-IRF3/IRF7 pathway and IFN-β is the reason for inhibiting DENV replication. In HUH-7 cells, huTLR3 can recognize DENV-1 and induce the expression of IFN-β, which can enhance the expression of huTLR3 on the contrary . TLR3 also induces type I IFN during WNV.

Doctors treating the sickest Covid-19 patients have zeroed in on a new phenomenon: Some people have developed widespread blood clots, their lungs peppered with tiny blockages that prevent oxygen from pumping into the bloodstream and body.As with so much else about the Covid-19 response, health experts are learning about the symptom on the fly. Blood clots are common in patients who are immobilized, but they seem to be smaller and cause far more severe damage in some Covid-19 patients. Doctors have said they see patients with blood clots forming not only in their lungs, but also in blood vessels. Autopsies have also revealed blood clots in kidneys and other organs, which some experts say suggests an overwhelming immune system response to the virus that inflicts harm on the body

Retinoic acid, is known to possess in vivo anti-inflammatory, anti-platelet and fibrinolytic activities. A study investigated the in vitro thrombin and platelet aggregation inhibitory activities of retinoic acid and retinaldehyde.Retinoic acid, retinaldehyde and retinol exhibited potent inhibition of thrombin, with IC50 values of 67μg/ml, 74μg/ml and 152μg/ml, respectively for the inhibition of thrombin (Sigma); and 49μg/ml, 74μg/ml and 178μg/ml, respectively for the inhibition of thrombin (plasma). Amongst vitamin A and its derivatives, retinoic acid showed the highest inhibition of both the forms of thrombin.

Isotretinoin(13cis RA) may be able to inhibit COVID 2019 infection via reversIing the androgenic induction and activation effect of (DHT) on TMPRSS2 expression and helps to prevent cleaving and activating both the spike protein (S) of COVID 2019 and the viral receptor, and this is discussed as follow :

TMPRSS2 is both the most frequently altered gene in primary prostate cancer and a critical factor enabling cellular infection by coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. The modulation of its expression by steroids could contribute to the male predominance of severe infections and given that TMPRSS2 has no known indispensable functions, and inhibitors are available, it is an appealing target for prevention or treatment of respiratory viral infections

TMPRSS2, a key regulator in prostate cancerTMPRSS2 was first identified in prostate cancer shortly after the gene had been originally cloned. Prostate cancer cell lines strongly upregulated TMPRSS2 expression in response to androgens . TMPRSS2 is expressed on the luminal side of the prostate epithelium, and its expression is increased in prostate cancer tissue compared to non-cancerous prostate tissue. Notably, the TMPRSS2 gene is a partner in one of the most common gene fusion eventsin solid tumors: somatic gene rearrangements involving TMPRSS2 witha member of the ETS family of oncogenic transcription factors, most commonly ERG. This fusion occurs in approximately 50% of primary prostate cancers among men of European ancestry.While ERG is not normally regulated by androgen, the gene fusion juxtaposes the androgen receptor regulatory elements of TMPRSS2 with the ERG gene. The ERG gene is consequently controlled by androgen receptor signaling and expressed highly in prostate cancers harboring the TMPRSS2: ERG fusion. Intriguingly, the prevalence of the TMPRSS2: ERG fusion is lower in prostate tumors of both black and Asian men. The relevance of this to the current COVID-19 pandemic is unclear.TMPRSS2: ERG fusion- cancers also have a distinct set of risk factors related to hormonal signaling. For example, men with higher genetically determined transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor have a higher risk of TMPRSS2: ERG fusion-positive prostate cancer but not of fusion-negative prostate cancer

TMPRSS2 is an androgen receptor signaling target gene and an androgen-regulated cell-surface serine protease expressed predominantly in prostate and lung epithelial cell TMPRSS2 is normally expressed several fold higher in the prostate relative to any other human tissue, though the normal physiological function(s) remains unknown. Importantly, unlike other TTSPs, TMPRSS2 transcription is regulated by androgenic ligands and the androgen receptor (AR). There is a positive correlation between AR and TMPRSS2 in microdissected primary tumor epithelium (r2 = 0.39 ; p <0.001).

Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) significantly and dramatically induced the expression of TMPRSS2 protein with two molecular masses of 60 (full-length) and 38 kDa (N-terminus) in a dose responsive manner

Data from Chinese outbreak show death rates for men almost 50 per cent higher than for women show that Early research from China suggests women and children are less likely to die than men if they catch the coronavirus. Death rates for Covid-19, the disease those infected with the coronavirus develop, are low for everyone: only 2.4 per cent of the 44,672 people in the Chinese study died. But although roughly even numbers of men and women catch the disease, men are more likely to develop such a serious case of Covid-19 they die.

More than 70 percent of Italy's coronavirus deaths have been among men but scientists there admit they are mystified by the gender gap. At least 3,400 people in Italy have died of the devastating disease - it yesterday announced it had a higher death Toll than China - but less than 1,000 of them have been women. Men are also more likely to pick up the infection in the first place and account for 60 percent of confirmed cases, according to Italy's public health research agency.

The virus is transmitted via airborne droplets to the nasal mucosa. Replication occurs locally in the nasal mucosa, in ciliated epithelial cells, over a 3-day incubation period. The mucosal cells are damaged with a resultant inflammatory response similar to the common cold. During this time the virus is shed in nasal secretions causing disease in the lower respiratory tract, potentially causing fatal viral pneumonia.

The literature supports that NO or its derivatives have inhibitory effects on a variety of viral infections. This inhibitory effect was shown to be marked in Interferon (IFN) mediated inhibition manifested by activated macrophage. It was also shown to be correlated with s-nitrosylation of viral proteins such as reductases and proteases.

Based on the genetic similarities between SARS and corona viruses, similar viricidal effects of NO on COVID-19 can be hypothesized.

SaNOtize has developed an innovative approach to provide nitric oxide gas using a formulation called Nitric Oxide Releasing Solution (NORS). This patented solution releases virucidal doses of NO for a sustained period (at least 30 min) against Influenza A.

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04348656;detailed_description;"Problem to be addressed: In December 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Committee (Wuhan, China) identified an outbreak of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause. Coronavirus RNA was quickly identified in some of these patients.This novel coronavirus has been designated SARS-CoV-2, and the disease caused by this virus has been designated COVID-19.Outbreak forecasting and mathematical modelling suggest that these numbers will continue to rise [1] in many countries over the coming weeks to months.Global efforts to evaluate novel antivirals and therapeutic strategies to treat COVID-19 have intensified. There is an urgent public health need for rapid development of novel interventions. At present, there is no specific antiviral therapy for coronavirus infections.

Passive immunization: Passive antibody therapy involves the administration of antibodies to a given agent to a susceptible individual for the purpose of preventing or treating an infectious disease due to that agent. In contrast, active vaccination requires the induction of an immune response that takes time to develop and varies depending on the vaccine recipient. Some immunocompromised patients fail to achieve an adequate immune response. Thus, passive antibody administration is the only means of providing immediate immunity to susceptible persons and immunity of any measurable kind for highly immunocompromised patients. The only antibody type that is currently available for immediate use is that found in human convalescent plasma.The American Food and Drug Agency (FDA) has recently announced clinical trials and a facilitated access to COVID-19 convalescent plasma for use is patients with severe or life-threatening infections [2].

Known potential risks and benefits: There is a theoretical risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE) through which virus targeted by non-neutralizing antibodies gain entry into macrophages. Another theoretical risk is that antibody administration to those exposed to SARS-CoV-2 may avoid disease but modify the immune response such that those individuals mount attenuated immune responses, which would leave them vulnerable to subsequent re-infection. Finally, there are risks associated with any transfusion of plasma including transmission of blood transmitted viruses (e.g. HIV, HBV, HCV, etc.), allergic transfusion reactions, including anaphylaxis, febrile non hemolytic transfusion reaction, transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI), transfusion associated cardiac overload (TACO), and hemolysis should ABO incompatible plasma be administered. Potential benefits of COVID-19 convalescent plasma include improved survival, improvement in symptoms, decreased risk in intubation for mechanical ventilation, decrease risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, shortened hospitalization time and suppression of viral load.

Mechanism of action: Transfusion of apheresis frozen plasma (AFP) from COVID-19 convalescent patients allows the transfer of donor neutralizing antibodies directed against SARS-CoV2 antigens to the recipient, thus allowing the generation of passive immunization. Naturally produced human antibody are polyclonal, meaning they are directed against a variety of different viral antigens and epitopes allowing for a general neutralizing effect against the virus rather than focussing on a specific target. Administration of convalescent plasma has been associated with rapid decrease in viral load. It is also possible that passive immunization contributes to improved cell-mediated immunity by favoring the phagocytosis and presentation of viral antigens to host T cells.

Participant recruitment:Only hospitalized COVID-19 patients are eligible so recruitment efforts will be focused on identified consecutive patients admitted to hospital with acute COVID-19 infection. No other external recruitment efforts are planned. At each participating hospital, a process for identifying patients with COVID-19 will be established.

Donor recruitment: Recovered COVID-19 patients will be identified as potential donors in collaboration with provincial public health services, local health authorities, and individual co-investigators involved in the study. Potential donors may also be recruiting following self-identification on the routine donor questionnaire or through social media. They will be contacted by phone and invited to participate in the program as potential donors. After obtaining verbal consent and reviewing donor selection criteria, eligible participants will be directed to a Héma-Québec collection or Canadian Blood Services apheresis collection site in their area to donate.

Criteria for donors: All donors will need to meet the criteria set forth in the Manual of donor selection criteria in use at Héma-Québec or Canadian Blood ServicesIn addition, donors will require:

Prior diagnosis of COVID-19 documented by a PCR test at time of infection or by positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology following infection
Complete resolution of symptoms
A delay of at least 14 days since resolution of COVID-19 symptoms
Male donors, or female donors with no pregnancy history or with negative anti-HLA antibodies
At least 6 days since last plasma donation
Provided informed consent

Randomization procedures: Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio (convalescent plasma vs standard of care). Patients will be randomized using a secure, concealed, computer-generated, web-accessed randomization sequence. Randomization will be stratified by centre and age (<60 and ≥ 60 years). Within each stratum, variable permuted block sized will be used. This approach will ensure that concealment of the treatment sequence is maintained.

Duration of follow-up: Subjects will be followed daily until hospital discharge or death. Patients discharged from hospital before Day 30 will be contacted by telephone on Day 30 ± 3 days to ascertain any AEs, vital status (dead/alive), hospital readmission and need for mechanical ventilation after discharge. Patients discharged from hospital will be contacted at Day 90+/- 7 days to determine vital status. Patients with a prolonged hospital admission will be censored at Day 90. The local study coordinator will collect all study data and record the data in the electronic CRF or paper CRF as per study procedures for each site.

Duration of study: For an individual subject, the study ends 90 days after randomization. The overall study will end when the last randomized subject has completed 90 day follow-up. We estimate that all patient will be enrolled in a period of 6 months, data on the primary endpoint will be available 30 days after last patient enrollment and data on all secondary endpoints will be available after 90-day from last patient enrollment.

Sample size considerations: Assuming a baseline risk of intubation or death of 30% in hospitalized patients with standard of care, a sample size of 1200 (800 in the convalescent plasma arm, and 400 in the standard of care arm) would provide 80% power to detect a relative risk reduction of 25% with convalescent plasma therapy using a 2-tailed test at level α = 0.05 and a 2:1 randomization.

Interim analysis: A single interim analysis is planned when the primary outcome (intubation or mortality at 30 days) is available for 50% of the target sample. An O'Brien-Fleming stopping rule will be used at that time, but treated as a guideline, so there is minimal impact on the threshold for statistical significance for the final significance test of the primary outcome. A DSMB will monitor ongoing results to ensure patient well-being and safety as well as study integrity. The DSMB will be asked to recommend early termination or modification only when there is clear and substantial evidence of a treatment difference.

Final analysis plan: The primary analysis will be based on the intention-to-treat population which will include data from all individuals who have been randomized. Outcomes will be attributed to the arm to which individuals were randomized irrespective of whether they received the planned intervention (e.g. plasma from a convalescent COVID-19 donor).";"Problem to be addressed: In December 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Committee (Wuhan, China) identified an outbreak of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause. Coronavirus RNA was quickly identified in some of these patients.This novel coronavirus has been designated SARS-CoV-2, and the disease caused by this virus has been designated COVID-19.Outbreak forecasting and mathematical modelling suggest that these numbers will continue to rise [1] in many countries over the coming weeks to months.Global efforts to evaluate novel antivirals and therapeutic strategies to treat COVID-19 have intensified. There is an urgent public health need for rapid development of novel interventions. At present, there is no specific antiviral therapy for coronavirus infections.

Passive immunization:Passive immunization consists in the transfer of antibodies from immunized donor to non-immunized individual in order to transfer transient protection against an infective agent. A physiological example of passive immunization is the transfer of maternal IgG antibodies to the foetus through the placenta to confer humoral protection to newborns in the first years of life. Passive immunization differs from active immunization in which the patient develops their own immune response following contact with the infective agent or vaccine.

Known potential risks and benefits: There is a theoretical risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE) through which virus targeted by non-neutralizing antibodies gain entry into macrophages. Another theoretical risk is that antibody administration to those exposed to SARS-CoV-2 may avoid disease but modify the immune response such that those individuals mount attenuated immune responses, which would leave them vulnerable to subsequent re-infection. Finally, there are risks associated with any transfusion of plasma including transmission of blood transmitted viruses (e.g. HIV, HBV, HCV, etc.), allergic transfusion reactions, including anaphylaxis, febrile non hemolytic transfusion reaction, transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI), transfusion associated cardiac overload (TACO), and hemolysis should ABO incompatible plasma be administered. Potential benefits of COVID-19 convalescent plasma include improved survival, improvement in symptoms, decreased risk in intubation for mechanical ventilation, decrease risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, shortened hospitalization time and suppression of viral load.

Mechanism of action: Transfusion of apheresis frozen plasma (AFP) from COVID-19 convalescent patients allows the transfer of donor neutralizing antibodies directed against SARS-CoV2 antigens to the recipient, thus allowing the generation of passive immunization. Naturally produced human antibody are polyclonal, meaning they are directed against a variety of different viral antigens and epitopes allowing for a general neutralizing effect against the virus rather than focussing on a specific target. Administration of convalescent plasma has been associated with rapid decrease in viral load. It is also possible that passive immunization contributes to improved cell-mediated immunity by favoring the phagocytosis and presentation of viral antigens to host T cells.

Participant recruitment:Only hospitalized COVID-19 patients are eligible so recruitment efforts will be focused on identified consecutive patients admitted to hospital with acute COVID-19 infection. No other external recruitment efforts are planned. At each participating hospital, a process for identifying patients with COVID-19 will be established.

Donor recruitment for Canadian sites: Recovered COVID-19 patients will be identified as potential donors in collaboration with provincial public health services, local health authorities, and individual co-investigators involved in the study. Potential donors may also be recruiting following self-identification on the routine donor questionnaire or through social media. They will be contacted by phone and invited to participate in the program as potential donors.

Male donors, or female donors with no pregnancy history or with negative anti-HLA antibodies
At least 6 days since last plasma donation
Provided informed consent
A complete resolution of symptoms at least 14 days prior to donation

Donor recruitment for United States sites: Recovered COVID-19 patients are being recruited through the New York Blood Center and Weill Cornell Medicine in separate protocols. Potential donors can self-refer via websites but also be referred by physicians or identified via the medical record system. Only donors with laboratory-confirmed history of COVID-19 will be screened. After providing consent and reviewing FDA and NYBC donor eligibility criteria, donors are screened for the presences of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the nasopharynx if screening within 14 days of complete resolution in accordance with current FDA guidance. Criteria for donation are subject to change based on future revision of FDA guidance. Those found to be eligible will be referred to NYBC for donation.

Criteria for donors:

Provision of informed consent
Aged 18 to 70 years. Donors are not longer eligible after their 71st birthday.
Documented molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR by nasopharyngeal swab, oropharyngeal swab, or sputum or detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in serum.
Complete resolution of COVID-19 symptoms at least 14 days prior to donation
Not currently pregnant or pregnant within 6 weeks by self-report
Male donors, or females with no pregnancy history or with negative anti-HLA antibodies
Meets blood donor criteria specified by NYBC, which is consistent with FDA regulations.

Donors will be allowed to donate every 7 days. The following information will be collection from donors: ABO group, sex, age, date of onset of symptoms (when available), date of resolution of symptoms (when available), CCP collection date(s).

Neutralizing antibodies against MERS, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to be present in patients previously infected with MERS, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 respectively. During the 2003 SARS outbreak in Hong-Kong,a non-randomized study in hospitalized SARS patients showed that treatment with convalescent plasma (convP) from SARS-recovered donors significantly increased the day 22 discharge rate and decreased mortality. A study in non-human primates showed that rhesus macaques could not be re-infected with SARS-CoV-2 after primary infection.

With no proven effective therapy against COVID-19, this protocol will evaluate the therapeutic potential of therapy with convalescent plasma from COVID-19 recovered donors.

Primary objectives

• Decrease overall mortality in patients within COVID disease

Study design:

This trial is a randomized comparative trial. Patients will be randomized between the infusion of 250mL of convP with standard of care.

Patient population:

Patients with PCR confirmed COVID disease, age >18 years Donors will be included with a known history of COVID who have been asymptomatic for at least 24 hours.

Intervention: 250mL of convP Duration of treatment: ConvP will be given as a one-time infusion Duration of follow up: Until discharge or death before day 60, whichever comes first

Target number of patients: 426 Target number of donors: 100";"Passive immunization with immunoglobulins is occasionally used as therapy for the treatment of viral infectious diseases. Immunoglobulins are used for the treatment of CMV disease, and is effective as prophylaxis when given soon after exposure to varicella zoster virus, rabies, and hepatitis B virus.

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04308668;detailed_description;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a rapidly emerging viral infection causing COVID19. The current strategy uses a public health model of identifying infected cases, isolation, and quarantine to stop transmission. Once exposed, observation is standard-of-care. No effective therapy currently exists for treatment. The lack of effective therapy diminishes persons presenting post-exposure for self-quarantine. Having an effective post-exposure prophylaxis, even if only partially effective, may additionally create synergy for the public health strategy of case identification and isolation - if a safe prophylaxis is available. People who develop COVID-19 disease generally develop signs and symptoms, including mild respiratory symptoms and fever, after an average of 5-6 days after exposure (i.e. mean incubation period). The range of the incubation period is between 1 to 14 days. Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus have mild disease and recover. Approximately 80% of laboratory-confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, which includes non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases, 14% have severe disease, and 6% are critically ill with respiratory failure, shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction. Chloroquine or Hydroxychloroquine may have antiviral effects against SARS-COV2 which may prevent COVID19 disease or early preemptive therapy may ameliorate disease severity. This trial will use a modification of standard malaria dosing of hydroxychloroquine to provide post-exposure prophylaxis / preemptive therapy. The trial is open to enrollment of healthcare workers or household contacts from across the United States. For information on how to participate in the research trial, please email covid19@umn.edu for instructions.;"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a rapidly emerging viral infection causing COVID19. The current strategy uses a public health model of identifying infected cases, isolation, and quarantine to stop transmission. Once exposed, observation is standard-of-care. Therapy is generally not given to persons who are not hospitalized. The doses of hydroxychloroquine being used are within the normal standard FDA-approved doses.

Hydroxychloroquine may have antiviral effects against SARS-COV2 which may prevent COVID-19 disease or early preemptive therapy may decrease disease severity. This trial will use a modification of standard malaria dosing of hydroxychloroquine to provide post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent disease or preemptive therapy for those with early symptoms. People around the the United States and Canada can participate to help answer this critically important question. No in-person visits are needed.

This trial is targeting 5 groups of people NATIONWIDE to participate:

If you are symptomatic with a positive COVID-19 test within the first 4 days of symptoms and are not hospitalized; OR
If you live with someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19, with your last exposure within the last 4 days, and do not have any symptoms; OR
If you live with someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19, and your symptoms started within the last 4 days; OR
If you have had occupational exposure with known exposure to someone with lab-confirmed COVID-19 within the last 4 days and do not have symptoms; OR
If you have had occupational exposure with known exposure to someone with lab-confirmed COVID-19 within the last 4 days AND have compatible symptoms starting within the last 4 days;

You may participate if you live anywhere in the United States (including territories) or in the Canadian Provinces of Quebec, Manitoba, Alberta, or Ontario.

*As determined by medical history and physical examination to evaluate acute or ongoing chronic medical diagnoses/conditions that have been present for at least 90 days, which would affect the assessment of safety of subjects. Chronic medical diagnoses/conditions should be stable for the last 60 days (no hospitalizations, emergency room (ER), or urgent care for condition or need for supplemental oxygen). This includes no change in chronic prescription medication, dose, or frequency as a result of deterioration of the chronic medical diagnosis/condition in the 60 days before enrollment. Any prescription change that is due to change of health care provider, insurance company, etc., or done for financial reasons, and in the same class of medication, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion. Any change in prescription medication due to improvement of a disease outcome, as determined by the participating site principal investigator (PI) or appropriate sub-investigator, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion. Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn) medications if, in the opinion of the participating site PI or appropriate sub-investigator, they pose no additional risk to subject safety or assessment of reactogenicity and immunogenicity, and do not indicate a worsening of medical diagnosis/condition. Similarly, medication changes subsequent to enrollment and study vaccination are acceptable provided the change was not precipitated by deterioration in the chronic medical condition, and there is no anticipated additional risk to the subject or interference with the evaluation of responses to study vaccination.

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04338126;detailed_description;"A recent report in Physiological Reviews proposed that the endogenous protease plasmin acts on COVID19 virus by cleaving a newly inserted furin site in the S protein portion of the virus resulting in increased infectivity and virulence. Patients with hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular illness, lung disease and kidney dysfunction commonly have elevated levels of plasmin/plasminogen and it was proposed that this may be the mechanism for poorer outcomes in patients with these co-morbidities. A logical treatment that might blunt this process would be the inhibition of the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. Fortunately, there is an inexpensive, commonly used drug, tranexamic acid (TXA) which suppresses this conversion and could be re-purposed for the treatment of COVID19. TXA is a synthetic analog of the amino acid lysine which reversibly binds four to five lysine receptor sites on plasminogen. This reduces conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, and is normally used to prevent fibrin degradation. TXA is FDA approved for treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding (typical dose 1300 mg p.o. three times per day x 5 days) and off-label use for many other indications. TXA is used perioperatively as a standard-of-care at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) for orthopedic and cardiac bypass surgeries. At UAB, it is commonly employed in hemorrhaging trauma patients and currently is being studied for perioperative use in Cesarean section surgeries. It has also been utilized for spinal surgery, neurosurgery, orthognathic surgeries and even long term for the treatment of cosmetic dermatological disorders with a long track record of safety.

Given the potential benefit and limited toxicity of TXA it would appear warranted to perform a rapid randomized, double-blind placebo controlled exploratory trial at UAB in the treatment of the early phases of COVID19 to determine whether it reduces infectivity and virulence of the COVID19 virus as hypothesized. Involvement of each patient is only for 7 days before primary endpoints.

An exploratory, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 2 clinical trial in which study patients have just been admitted to the regular hospital (non-Intensive Care Unit; ICU) for the diagnosis of COVID19 is proposed. The overall goal of this exploratory study is to assess both safety and efficacy of 5 days of TXA versus placebo in the COVID19 population. All patients would also receive daily Lovenox. The primary endpoint for the study would be a need for transfer to an ICU. Contact would be daily and via remote processes. Care for the COVID19 patient would otherwise be standard of care and directed by the primary caretakers of the patient.";"A recent report in Physiological Reviews proposed that the endogenous protease plasmin acts on COVID19 virus by cleaving a newly inserted furin site in the S protein portion of the virus resulting in increased infectivity and virulence.

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04355936;detailed_description;"In late 2019, a new coronavirus emerged in Wuhan Province, China, causing lung complications similar to those produced by the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in the 2002-2003 epidemic. This new disease was named COVID-19 and the causative virus SARS-CoV-2 (Chen, Liu, & Guo, 2020; Li et al., 2020).

Given that vaccines against COVID-19 are still in development and an effective treatment against this new coronavirus is lacking, various pharmacological agents are being tested in clinical trials designed by institutions such as the WHO or scientific entities in different countries (C.-C. Lu, Chen, & Chang, 2020).

Taking into account the characteristics of the mode of entry of this coronavirus to human cells through binding with Angiotensin Converting Enzime 2 (ACE2) and extensive scientific and clinical evidence information on the Renin Angiotensin System, the hypothesis of the involvement of this system in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 was born (Gurwitz, 2020; Vaduganathan et al., 2020).

The SARS-CoV-2 virus, enters the airway and binds, by means of the S (Spike) protein on its surface (after whose image the term coronavirus is coined), to the membrane protein ACE2 in type 2 alveolar cells (R. Lu et al., 2020; Wan, Shang, Graham, Baric, & Li, 2020). The S protein-ACE2 complex is internalized by endocytosis and facilitates the entry of each virion into the cytoplasm. For each intracellular entry, the function of one ACE2 molecule is lost leading to a partial decrease or total loss of the enzymatic function ACE2 in the alveolar cells of the lung directly related to the viral load of the air inoculum.

ACE2 catalyzes the transformation of angiotensin II into angiotensin 1-7. Angiotensin II acting on AT1 receptors causes vasoconstriction, apoptosis, proinflammatory effects, and fibrosis. Angiotensin 1-7 acting on Mas receptors causes opposite effects: vasodilation and anti-inflammatory. Partial decrease or total loss of ACE2 function in alveolar cells results in a deviation of the homeostatic balance of the Renin Angiotensin System in favor of the angiotensin II-AT1 receptor axis (Paz Ocaranza et al., 2020; Tikellis, Bernardi, & Burns, 2011). Indeed, it increases the tissue concentration of angiotensin II by decreasing its degradation and reduces the concentration of its physiological antagonist angiotensin 1-7(Liu et al., 2020).

The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 disease will depend fundamentally on the degree of alteration of the homeostatic balance of the Renin Angiotensin System in the lung and at the systemic level (mainly at the heart).

Increasing the effects of angiotensin II on the lung interstitium can promote apoptosis, which, in turn, initiates an inflammatory process with release of proinflammatory cytokines, establishing a self-powered cascade (Cardoso et al., 2018). In certain patients this process reaches such clinical relevance that requires external oxygen supply and in severe cases an Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) ensues (this correlates with an acute release -storm- of cytokines) (Ware & Matthay, 2000).

Based on the aetiopathogenic hypothesis described, there are various pharmacotherapeutic proposals to be evaluated through clinical trials: Recombinant ACE2 therapy, administration of agents aimed at increasing ACE2 levels (e.g. estradiol), and administration of drugs that decrease the elevated activity of angiotensin II including renin release inhibitors, classic ACE inhibitors or Angiotensin Receptor 1 Blockers (ARBs).

Most patients who develop COVID-19 disease initially have fever, indicative ofan inflammatory process with systemic release of pyrogenic cytokines. According to the hypothesis described, this inflammation is induced by the inhibition of ACE2 and the imbalance of the renin angiotensin system in the pulmonary interstitium in favor of the angiotensin II-AT1 receptor axis. Faced with the onset of the inflammatory process, a rapidly effective treatment is necessary to antagonize the cascading and self-sustaining phenomenon described. Of the different types of drugs mentioned above, we consider that the most rapidly effective may be ARBs.

Recently, Gurwitz (2020) proposed the tentative use of agents such as losartan and telmisartan as alternative options for treating COVID-19 patients prior to development of ARDS.

ARBs are widely used to treat hypertension and there is an abundant clinical experience with its use, all representatives of this group being characterized by their excellent tolerance; Furthermore, its adverse effects profile has been described as ""placebo like(Schumacher & Mancia, 2008; Sharpe, Jarvis, & Goa, 2001).

The most suitable ARB to antagonize the proinflammatory effects of angiotensin II in a patient with a recent positive COVID-19 test should be the compound with the best pharmacological properties for this indication. From the comparative analysis of the available ARBs, telmisartan gathers properties that make it the best pharmacological tool to evaluate the hypothesis under discussion in a clinical trial.

Liposolubility is relevant for absorption after oral administration and for tissue penetration. Telmisartan stands out among all the representatives of the ARBs for being markedly more lipophilic, expressed both in partition coefficients (octanol / neutral pH buffer), distribution coefficients and distribution volumes (Vd). Telmisartan has a Vd of approximately 500 L, irbesartan 93 L, and both valsartan and olmesartan, candesartan and losartan, approximately 17 L.

The affinity of ARBs for the AT1 receptor has been measured by multiple studies, mainly using radioligand binding studies. All AT1 receptor blockers are characterized by having similar affinity values (pKi or pIC50, between 2 and 19 nM), with losartan and its active metabolite EXP3174 being the lowest and irbesartan, candesartan and telmisartan the highest (Kakuta, Sudoh, Sasamata, & Yamagishi, 2005).

Using isolated organ technique on blood vessels from different tissues and from different animals, these AT1 antagonists have a blocking power (pA2) against angiotensin II in the nM range (losartan, 8.15; irbesartan, 8.52; valsartan, 9.26; telmisartan 9.48; candesartan, 10.08). Telmisartan has a 10-fold higher blocking potency than losartan (Kakuta et al., 2005).

Functional as well as biochemical studies determining the dissociation rates of the ARBs have shown that these drugs have a slow dissociation rate that gives them characteristics of pseudo-irreversible blocking agents. In the only comparative study using cloned human AT1 receptors, the half-lives of receptor dissociation were: telmisartan, 213 min; olmesartan, 166 min; candesartan, 133 min; valsartan, 70 min; losartan, 67 min (Kakuta et al., 2005). Telmisartan is the AT1 blocker that dissociates more slowly from the receptor. This property may be clinically relevant as it maintains a longer lasting blockade difficult to reverse by the endogenous agonist angiotensin II.

Furthermore, telmisartan causes downregulation of AT1 receptor at the mRNA and protein level apparently due to its action as a partial agonist of PPAR-gamma (Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma). This action can contribute to the effects of telmisartan by producing a decrease in the number of AT1 receptors (Imayama et al., 2006).

In summary, telmisartan, which is well absorbed after oral administration, is the ARB with the longest plasma half-life (24 h), it reaches the highest tissue concentrations due to its high lipid solubility and high volume of distribution (500 L), and dissociates more slowly after binding to the AT1 receptor, causing an apparently irreversible block (Kakuta et al., 2005; Michel, Foster, Brunner, & Liu, 2013).

The present study is an open-label randomized phase II clinical trial for the evaluation of telmisartan in COVID-19 patients. Briefly, patients with confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, will be randomized to receive 80 mg/12h of telmisartan (Bertel®, Laboratorio Elea Phoenix, Buenos Aires, Argentina) plus standard care or standard care alone and will be monitored for development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Other variables regarding lung function, systemic inflammation and cardiovascular function will also be evaluated.

Clinical studies to evaluate the safety of Telmisartan in healthy individuals or in hypertensive patients with daily doses of up to 160 mg, found no difference between those treated with telmisartan and the placebo group in frequency and intensity of adverse effects (Schumacher & Mancia, 2008; Sharpe et al., 2001; Stangier, Su, & Roth, 2000).";"In late 2019, a new coronavirus emerged in Wuhan Province, China, causing lung complications similar to those produced by the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in the 2002-2003 epidemic.

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04338347;detailed_description;"This is an expanded access protocol that will enroll subjects with clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 infection confirmed by laboratory testing and who are in critical condition as indicated by life support measurements. Prior to protocol procedures, informed consent will be obtained from the subject or a legally authorized representative. Subjects will undergo a screening evaluation to determine eligibility based on the protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Eligible subjects will receive open-label intravenous administration of investigational product (CAP-1002) containing 150 million allogeneic Cardiosphere-Derived Cells (CDCs). CAP-1002 administration will be conducted at the investigative site on Day 1 and weekly up to a maximum of 4 doses, based on clinical course. Starting at the second CAP-1002 administration and at all subsequent administrations, medications may be administered to the subject at the Investigator's discretion based on the pre-treatment guidelines provided by Capricor and/or institutional protocols to minimize the risk of potential severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis. Final decisions regarding the pre-treatment medication(s), dose(s) administered, and route(s) of administration will be determined by the Investigator taking into consideration the subject's medical status, COVID-19, related conditions, concomitant medications, and medical history. For any pre-treatment medication administered, the FDA approved label will be reviewed for information on potential side effects and/or drug interactions and followed for detailed instructions on weight-based dosing.

Subjects will complete protocol assessments at Screening; Day 1; Weeks 1-3; and Follow-up by phone 30 and 90 days after the last infusion. Baseline assessments will be conducted prior to first infusion on Day 1.

The patient will be observed during the lengths of hospitalization and monitored for outcome and safety with vital signs, physical examinations, ECGs, PFTs, clinical laboratory testing (including CBC, BMP, BNP, CRP, ESR, hsCRP, cytokine assay, viral load/nasal swab), troponin I/troponin T and transthoracic echocardiogram. Additional CT and/or cardiac MRI imaging may be performed, as appropriate. Safety and outcome data (including mortality, need for additional levels of supportive care, length of stay) will be collected and reported at the conclusion of treatment and follow-up. Additional samples of blood may be collected for proteomic analysis.";"This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will enroll subjects with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by laboratory testing. Prior to protocol procedures, informed consent will be obtained from the subject or a legally authorized representative. Eligible subjects will be randomized to either CAP-1002 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Intravenous administration of CAP-1002 or placebo will occur at the clinical site on Day 1 and Day 7 (± 1 day) for a maximum of 2 doses, based on clinical course.

Subjects will complete Screening, a Treatment Phase and a Follow-up Phase. A detailed medical history will be collected, including the presence of any co-morbidities and risk factors believed to be associated with COVID-19 outcomes (e.g., age, gender, diabetes, COPD or respiratory conditions, body mass index, cardiovascular or renal disease) or emergent factors since the time of infection. The Treatment Phase is variable based on each subject's clinical status while the subject remains in the hospital and will contain either one or two treatment periods. Baseline safety and efficacy assessments will be conducted prior to the first infusion. Follow-up will be conducted on Day 15 and Day 30 from the first infusion in Treatment Period 1. Follow-up will either be conducted in the inpatient setting or as a phone follow-up should the subject be discharged. Subjects will be observed during the index hospitalization and monitored for outcome and safety with vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation), physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), clinical laboratory testing (CBC, CMP, BNP, CRP, ESR, cytokine assay, viral load, troponin I, myoglobin, ferritin, procalcitonin, ABGs, and lipid panel), chest x-rays, and adverse events. A blood sample will be collected at the clinical site and sent to a central laboratory for proteomic assay testing. Transthoracic echocardiograms will be performed when indicated by clinical or laboratory evidence of cardiac involvement during the index hospitalization. Use of any concomitant medications to treat COVID-19 will be documented.

Stopping rules on the subject-level and study-level have been defined to ensure subjects are not exposed to significant risk. Oversight of the trial will be provided by independent Clinical Event Committee (CEC), Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), and Medical Monitor."

Severe acute respiratory infection with novel coronavirus (SARI-nCoV) causes severe acute respiratory failure with substantial mortality. Currently, the standard care is supportive care, and no treatment is proven to be effective for this condition. Glucocorticoid therapy is widely used among critically ill patients with other coronavirus infection such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome). However, whether glucocorticoid improved the outcome of 2019-nConV remains unknown. We hypothesized that glucocorticoid would improve the prognosis of patietns with SARI-nCoV. In this study, critically ill patients with 2019-nConV were enrolled and randomized to receive ether standard care or standard care in combination with methylprednisolone therapy. The primary outcome is the difference of Murray lung injury score between two groups.;"COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that was initially outbreak in Wuhan, China.

Currently, the standard care is supportive care, and no treatment is proven to be effective for this condition.

Glucocorticoid therapy is widely used among critically ill patients with other coronavirus infection such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome). However, whether glucocorticoid improved the outcome of COVID-19 remains unknown. We hypothesized that glucocorticoid would improve the prognosis of patietns with COVID-19.

In this study, critically ill patients with COVID-19 were enrolled and randomized to receive ether standard care or standard care in combination with methylprednisolone therapy. The primary outcome is the difference of Murray lung injury score between two groups."

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04374942;detailed_description;"On March 11th, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory virus coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) a pandemic. As of March 22, 2020 there have been over 267,013 confirmed cases and 11,201 deaths in 185 different countries or regions; it is quickly overwhelming health care systems worldwide to detrimental effect. Even with current moderate interventions imposed, estimates predict that 10-18% of the Canadian population will be infected with the virus by its peak in July. Health care workers (HCWs) remain a critical line of defence in the fight against this pandemic and maintaining their health is not only an important social responsibility of the government, but it is also of vital national interest to treat and control others infected with this virus or sick with other disease.

Estimates from China indicate that HCWs make up 3.8% of cases, while in Italy it is reported to be much higher - 8.3%. Early numbers from front-line workers in Italy suggested up to 20% of HCWs become infected with COVID-19, and these rates are approximately 3 times higher than the general population. When HCWs become sick, not only do they risk dying, but they also must take weeks away from work limiting the ability of the health care system to function. The fear associated with becoming ill also causes higher rates of missed work and higher rates of burnout, as seen with previous outbreaks. It is also now clear that asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 not only occurs, but may even be the most important factor in spread of the virus. HCWs may therefore become vectors of viral spread to those who are the most vulnerable in other areas of the hospital. Preventing our HCWs from acquiring SARS-CoV-2 should therefore be of the utmost importance to our national interests.

Repurposing drugs already known to be safe and tolerable in humans provides a major advantage in a pandemic where time is critical. Of candidate drugs, chloroquine (CQ) and its derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), have shown some promise. Originally an anti-malarial medication, CQ exerts direct antiviral effects by inhibiting pH-dependent steps of the replication of several viruses, including coronaviruses. It also has immunomodulatory effects, suppressing the release of TNFα and IL-6, which are involved in the inflammatory complications of several viral diseases. In vitro data has shown that CQ potently blocks virus infection at low micromolar concentrations with a high selectivity index. CQ is also widely distributed throughout the body, including the lungs, after oral administration. An early clinical trial of more than 100 COVID-19 patients in China reported that CQ was superior to placebo in inhibiting pneumonia, improving lung imaging, promoting viral seroconversion, and shortening the disease course, although data was not released. Based on those results experts in China recommended CQ 500mg twice daily for ten days in all patients with COVID-19. HCQ has also been shown to also have anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in vitro and may actually be more potent. It has a better safety profile than CQ (during long term use), and allows a higher daily dose, with fewer concerns of drug-drug interactions. Preliminary clinical data also suggests that HCQ may lead to significantly faster viral clearance in COVID-19 patients as assessed by nasopharyngeal swab (70% vs. 12.5%, p=0.001).

PrEP offers the ability to protect front-line HCWs from illness, decrease nosocomial spread of SARS-CoV-2, and prevent loss of work force due to illness. Rigorous testing of HCQ for this purpose is critical at this time. We therefore aim to conduct the first randomized placebo-controlled trial of HCQ to prevent COVID-19 infections in emergency departments (ED) as we prepare for escalating rates of COVID-19 in Toronto, Canada.";"On March 11th, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory virus coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) a pandemic.

Porphyrins have been used for photodynamic therapy (PDT) against a wide range of targets like bacteria, viruses and tumor cells It has been reported that ROS-based inactivation of viruses may occur due to several reasons, such as protein oxidation, single strand breaks in the RNA genome and protein-RNA crosslinking. Since ROS-based inactivation has a multi-targeted mechanism, it is much less likely that a virus would be able to develop resistance against it. Recently, porphyrins, already in use as photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy (PDT), were a study target to applications in medical area, namely as possible contrast agents in MRI. could be observed some examples of porphyrin derivatives already study as MRI contrast media. Low dark toxicity, neoplastic tissue affinity and synthetic accessibility are some of the important properties that contribute for its selection. In MRI studies was found that CM based on paramagnetic metalloporphyrins showed higher affinity for neoplastic tissues, observed by increased relaxation time of the neoplastic tissues, which is reflected on an increase in MRI signal and consequently in a better neoplastic lesions detection. A study demonestrated that The sulfonated tetranaphthyl porphyrin contrast agents in MRI (TNapPS), sulfonated tetra-anthracenyl porphyrin (TAnthPS), and sulfonated 2,6-difluoro-meso-tetraphenylporphine [TPP(2,6-F2)S] and its copper chelate [TPP(2,6-F2)S,Cu], which reduced HIV infection by 99, 96, 94, and 96%, respectively. Previous studies which showed that Covid -19 binds to the porphyrin of haem and displaces iron in addition to Sulfonated porphyrins and light-stimulated Sn- protoporphyrin IX have broad antiviral activity against more distinct types of viruses, Co-protoporphyrin IX and Sn-protoporphyrin IX inactivate Zika, Chikungunya and other arboviruses by targeting the viral envelope Porphyrins are amphipathic molecules able to interact with membranes and absorb light, being widely used in photodynamic therapy. Previously, we showed that heme, Co-protoporphyrin IX (CoPPIX) and Sn-protoporphyrin IX (SnPPIX) directly inactivate DENV and YFV infectious particles. Here we demonstrate that the antiviral activity of these porphyrins can be broadened to CHIKV, ZIKV, Mayaro virus, Sindb is virus and Vesicular Stomatitis virus.

Introduction:

Pandemic Covid-19 pneumonia, of SARS-CoV-2 aetiology, presents an existential threat to health care systems globally. Multiple therapeutic and prophylactic agents are currently undergoing clinical trial, including 23 clinical trials of (hydroxy) chloroquine in China. While progress towards a curative agent or vaccine is promising, the principal limiting factor in public health emergency is time, and therefore Virus resistance to antiviral therapies is an increasing concern that makes the development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs urgent. Targeting of the viral envelope, a component shared by a large number of viruses, emerges as a promising strategy to overcome this problem. Natural and synthetic porphyrins are good candidates for antiviral development due to their relative hydrophobicity and pro-oxidant character a pre-existing licensed therapeutic would offer reprieve to health care systems operating at the edge of capacity. In this brief communication, the Principal investigator argues that Covid-19 has high probability of being more than a disease of pneumonia, and that critical Covid-19 patients may be experiencing a form of acquired acute porphyria. Readily available interventions exist to treat acute porphyria and the position is advanced that urinalysis of critical Covid-19 patients would diagnose this pathology.

COVID-19 bind to porphyrin and cause acquired porphyria.

Erythrocytes are strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of Covid-19. Wuhan University researchers argue that the role of erythrocytes in the pathophysiology of Covid-19 is under-estimated; the co-efficient of variation of red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is predictive of severity of disease state (Gong 2020). Elevated RDW is correlated with reduced erythrocyte turnover; red blood cells become smaller as they age and the delay in clearance expands the low-volume tail of the volume distribution (Patel 2015). Suppressed erythrocyte turnover may indicate erythropoietic distress and function as a compensatory mechanism to maintain circulating red blood cell levels (Patel 2015).

Excess porphyrins in red blood cells can precipitate cell lysis and development of hemolytic anaemia (Sassa 2006). Macaques infected with SARS-CoV- 2 also have decreased red blood cell numbers (Munster 2020) and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 appears to be determined by blood group; blood group A is most affected whereas blood group O seems to be protected (Yang 2020). This finding is concordant with previous studies showing that susceptibility to the 2003 strain of SARS-CoV was determined by blood group (Guillon 2008). Preliminary evidence suggests that CD147, the determinant of the Ok blood group system, binds the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (Wang 2020). Incidentally, CD147 functions as an essential receptor for erythrocyte invasion by Plasmodium falciparum (Crosnier 2011). Blockade of CD147 abrogates the normal recirculation of erythrocytes, from the spleen into the general circulation, leading to selective trapping of red blood cells in the spleen as development of a form of anaemia (Coste 2001). Autopsy of deceased Covid-19 patients reveals that the spleen is significantly reduced in size. Reduction in spleen size would be expected in the event that the spleen has emptied its reserve of erythrocytes into the circulation as part of a normal physiological response to anaemia (Dale 2016).

Primate models of Covid-19 (Munster 2020) and human Covid-19 patients have subnormal haemoglobin levels (Chen 2020). Clinical evaluation of almost 100 Wuhan patients reveals haemoglobin levels below the normal range in most patients as well as increased total bilirubin and elevated serum ferritin (Chen 2020). Hyperbilirubinemia is observed in acute porphyria (Sassa 2006) and would be consistent with ineffective erythropoiesis (Sulovska 2016) and rapid haemoglobin turnover.

COVID-19 and Porphyrin of haem:-

Elevated serum ferritin levels are typical of acute porphyria (Trier 2013) and would be expected upon dissociation of iron from haem. A mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 might attack the 1beta chain of haemoglobin has been proposed; the product of open reading frame 8 (ORF8) binds to the porphyrin of haem and displaces iron, according to bioinformatics prediction analyses (Liu 2020).

The oxygen-carrying capacity of erythrocytes would therefore be compromised by SARS-CoV-2, thereby exacerbating the difficulties already experienced by the patient, in terms of maintaining partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli (PaO2). While the impact of SARS-CoV-2 targeting of haemoglobin on oxygen content of the blood would therefore be considerable, the author proposes that perhaps of greater concern, are potential ramifications upon homeostatic regulation of haem anabolism. Haem biosynthesis is exquisitely controlled by seven enzyme-controlled reactions proceeding from the first intermediate, aminolevulinic acid (ALA), to haem as thefinal product. Haem negatively regulates the first step in the pathway by repressing expression of aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS).

SARSCoV- 2 is predicted to directly interfere with haem production (Liu 2020), and this prediction is supported by empirical evidence of reduced haemoglobin levels in Covid-19 patients (Chen 2020) and in animal models of the disease (Munster 2020). Decreased haem production dampens repression of ALAS, and thereby increases the production of haem precursors, leading to accumulation of porphyrin intermediate metabolites. All of the haem pathway intermediates are potentially toxic (Sassa 2006). During an attack of acute porphyria, ALAS is induced 2006) and this perturbation continues until sufficient haem synthesis is restored. Phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 porphyrin excess is hypothesised to mimic extreme lead poisoning; both as examples of acquired acute porphyria.

Overproduction of haem precursors - aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG), in particular - manifests life-threatening attacks (Pischik 2015) with neurovisceral symptoms (Sassa 2006), including: abdominal pain (85-95% cases), vomiting (43-88%), constipation (48-84%), muscle weakness (42-60%), mental symptoms (40-58%), pain of the limbs, head, neck and chest (50-52%), hypertension (36-54%), tachycardia (28-80%), convulsion (10-20%), sensory loss (9-38%), fever (9-37%), respiratory paralysis (5-12%) and diarrhoea (5-12%). Neurotoxicity of aminolevulinic acid accounts for the plethora of neurovisceral symptoms and, interestingly, there is considerable overlap between neurovisceral complaints of ALA excess and extra-pulmonary symptoms of critical Covid-19 patients. Extra-pulmonary symptoms of Covid-19 are significant but under-estimated, including gastrointestinal symptoms (Poggiali 2020), which news reports suggest may affect in the region of 50% Covid-19 patients. Neurological problems also appear to be overlooked by the hyper-focus on respiratory symptoms (Zhao 2020). Of 214 Covid-19 patients, 36.4% experienced neurological manifestations including: headache, dizziness, acute cerebrovascular incidents and impaired consciousness (Mao 2020). Loss of autonomic control of breathing has also been reported and autonomic neuropathy is a clinical feature of acute porphyria (Laiwah 1985). Neuropsychiatric symptoms of Covid-19 may be downstream of irregularities in haem metabolism.

The most important question is now asked by Principal investigator Can X ray stimulated porphyrins act against COVID-19 as like as Sn- protoporphyrin IX mechanism in impeding the entry and division of the virus(Zika, Chikungunya and other arbo viruses) by targeting the viral envelope and protect hemoglobin and blood components that are affected by the viral infection?

The principal investigator expect the possibility of inhibiting Covid -19 by Sulfonated porphyrins X-ray induced visible luminescence of porphyrin and light-stimulated Sn- protoporphyrin IX because According to previous studies which showed that Covid -19 binds to the porphyrin of haem and displaces iron in addition to Sulfonated porphyrins and light-stimulated Sn- protoporphyrin IX have broad antiviral activity against more distinct types of viruses, Co-protoporphyrin IX and Sn-protoporphyrin IX inactivate Zika, Chikungunya and other arboviruses by targeting the viral envelope Porphyrins are amphipathic molecules able to interact with membranes and absorb light, being widely used in photodynamic therapy. Previously, we showed that heme, Co-protoporphyrin IX (CoPPIX) and Sn-protoporphyrin IX (SnPPIX) directly inactivate DENV and YFV infectious particles. Here we demonstrate that the antiviral activity of these porphyrins can be broadened to CHIKV, ZIKV, Mayaro virus, Sindb is virus and Vesicular Stomatitis virus. Porphyrin treatment causes viral envelope protein loss, affecting viral morphology, adsorption and entry into target cells (Neris 2018)

The sulfonated tetranaphthyl porphyrin (TNapPS), sulfonated tetra-anthracenyl porphyrin (TAnthPS), and sulfonated 2,6-difluoro-meso-tetraphenylporphine [TPP(2,6-F2)S] and its copper chelate [TPP(2,6-F2)S,Cu], which reduced HIV infection by 99, 96, 94, and 96%, respectively (Andrei 2002)

Treatment of HepG2 cells with heme, CoPPIX and SnPPIX after DENV infection reduced infectious particles without affecting viral RNA contents in infected cells. The reduction of viral load occurs only with the direct contact of DENV with porphyrins, suggesting a direct effect on viral particles. Previously incubation of DENV and YFV with heme, CoPPIX and SnPPIX resulted in viral particles inactivation in a dose-dependent manner. Biliverdin, a noncyclical porphyrin, was unable to inactivate the viruses tested. Infection of HepG2 cells with porphyrin-pretreated DENV2 results in a reduced or abolished viral protein synthesis, RNA replication and cell death. Treatment of HepG2 or THP-1 cell lineage with heme or CoPPIX after DENV infection with a very low MOI resulted in a decreased DENV replication and protection from death. (Assunção 2016)

summary In summary, SARS-CoV-2 would not be the first known virus to alter porphyrin metabolism; hepatitis C virus (Hep C) and human immunodeficiency virus(HIV) infection lead to a non-acute form of porphyria (Blauvelt 1996). So the principal investigator expects and suggests that porphyrin based therapy is suitable and effective treatment against COVID-19 and could Protects hemoglobin and RBCs from dangerous influence of COVID-19 .The possibility of therapeutic application of porphyrins or their use as models to design new antiviral drugs against DENV ,COVID -19 and YFV.";"Efficacy of Sunlight Activated Synthetic Porphyrin in COVID-19 Infected Patients (SnPPIX)

Introduction:

Pandemic Covid-19 pneumonia, of SARS-CoV-2 aetiology, presents an existential threat to health care systems globally. Multiple therapeutic and prophylactic agents are currently undergoing clinical trial, including 23 clinical trials of (hydroxy) chloroquine in China. While progress towards a curative agent or vaccine is promising, the principal limiting factor in public health emergency is time, and therefore Virus resistance to antiviral therapies is an increasing concern that makes the development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs urgent. Targeting of the viral envelope, a component shared by a large number of viruses, emerges as a promising strategy to overcome this problem. Natural and synthetic porphyrins are good candidates for antiviral development due to their relative hydrophobicity and pro-oxidant character a pre-existing licensed therapeutic would offer reprieve to health care systems operating at the edge of capacity. In this brief communication, the Principal investigator argues that Covid-19 has high probability of being more than a disease of pneumonia, and that critical Covid-19 patients may be experiencing a form of acquired acute porphyria. Readily available interventions exist to treat acute porphyria and the position is advanced that urinalysis of critical Covid-19 patients would diagnose this pathology.

COVID-19 binds to porphyrin and cause acquired porphyria.

Erythrocytes are strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of Covid-19. Wuhan University researchers argue that the role of erythrocytes in the pathophysiology of Covid-19 is under-estimated; the co-efficient of variation of red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is predictive of severity of disease state (Gong 2020). Elevated RDW is correlated with reduced erythrocyte turnover; red blood cells become smaller as they age and the delay in clearance expands the low-volume tail of the volume distribution (Patel 2015). Suppressed erythrocyte turnover may indicate erythropoietic distress and function as a compensatory mechanism to maintain circulating red blood cell levels (Patel 2015).

Excess porphyrins in red blood cells can precipitate cell lysis and development of hemolytic anaemia (Sassa 2006). Macaques infected with SARS-CoV- 2 also have decreased red blood cell numbers (Munster 2020) and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 appears to be determined by blood group; blood group A is most affected whereas blood group O seems to be protected (Yang 2020). This finding is concordant with previous studies showing that susceptibility to the 2003 strain of SARS-CoV was determined by blood group (Guillon 2008). Preliminary evidence suggests that CD147, the determinant of the Ok blood group system, binds the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (Wang 2020). Incidentally, CD147 functions as an essential receptor for erythrocyte invasion by Plasmodium falciparum (Crosnier 2011). Blockade of CD147 abrogates the normal recirculation of erythrocytes, from the spleen into the general circulation, leading to selective trapping of red blood cells in the spleen as development of a form of anaemia (Coste 2001). Autopsy of deceased Covid-19 patients reveals that the spleen is significantly reduced in size. Reduction in spleen size would be expected in the event that the spleen has emptied its reserve of erythrocytes into the circulation as part of a normal physiological response to anaemia (Dale 2016).

Primate models of Covid-19 (Munster 2020) and human Covid-19 patients have subnormal haemoglobin levels (Chen 2020). Clinical evaluation of almost 100 Wuhan patients reveals haemoglobin levels below the normal range in most patients as well as increased total bilirubin and elevated serum ferritin (Chen 2020). Hyperbilirubinemia is observed in acute porphyria (Sassa 2006) and would be consistent with ineffective erythropoiesis (Sulovska 2016) and rapid haemoglobin turnover.

COVID-19 and Porphyrin of haem:-

Elevated serum ferritin levels are typical of acute porphyria (Trier 2013) and would be expected upon dissociation of iron from haem. A mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 might attack the 1beta chain of haemoglobin has been proposed; the product of open reading frame 8 (ORF8) binds to the porphyrin of haem and displaces iron, according to bioinformatics prediction analyses (Liu 2020).

The oxygen-carrying capacity of erythrocytes would therefore be compromised by SARS-CoV-2, thereby exacerbating the difficulties already experienced by the patient, in terms of maintaining partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli (PaO2). While the impact of SARS-CoV-2 targeting of haemoglobin on oxygen content of the blood would therefore be considerable, the author proposes that perhaps of greater concern, are potential ramifications upon homeostatic regulation of haem anabolism. Haem biosynthesis is exquisitely controlled by seven enzyme-controlled reactions proceeding from the first intermediate, aminolevulinic acid (ALA), to haem as thefinal product.

A standardized, IRB approved email will be sent to department chairs describing the study. A research coordinator will reach out to interested participants via phone with the help of an IRB-approved verbal script to introduce the study, confirm eligibility and provide further instructions on how to access and sign the IRB-approved ICD via REDCap using their own electronic devices. It is important that the investigators obtain the consent via REDCAp to a) avoid direct person-to-person contact and comply with social distancing imposed recommendations, and b) minimize the waste of reconstituted BCG by allowing the research personnel to schedule vaccinations in a controlled fashion. Patient registration into the trial will happen immediately after consent has been provided and will involve entering of baseline information into an electronic data capture system (RedCap).

Once the eligibility is confirmed and the ICD signed by the participant and stored in REDCap, the research coordinator will randomize the participant and communicate the treatment assignment to the nurse administering the vaccination. The nurse will subsequently assign an appointment and communicate date and time of vaccination with the participant. All eligible participants will receive intradermal injections of BCG:placebo in a 1:1 ratio.

Both, participants and investigators will be blinded to the treatment assignments during the study. However, in case of an emergency where it is important to know the treatment received, the investigator and/or participant can reach out to the unblinded study personnel who will provide the unblinded data. All participants will receive their treatment allocation at the end of the study, after the data analysis is finalized.

Unblinded personnel will not be involved in the collection and analysis of study data other than the baseline eligibility criteria.

The end of the study is defined as the last patient's last entry in the electronic data capture system.

Informed Consent and Eligibility

The following types of procedures will be conducted as indicated below:

Medical history will be obtained from patient medical record/clinical chart. Informed Consent will be obtained to access these records. When information cannot be obtained or is not available from the patient medical record/clinical chart, it will be obtained via patient interview. Physical examination will be conducted solely to look for existing BCG vaccination scars.

Symptom evaluation will be conducted via an electronic survey administered to participants every 1-3 days.

HIV and pregnancy will be collected as self-reported information. If unknown, a urine pregnancy test will be performed.

Nasopharyngeal, oral and/ or rectal swabs will be collected for rt-PCR test for SARS-CoV2 infection if a study develops symptoms consistent with Covid-19.

If a participant does not know their PPD/IGRA status from within the last 24 months (all health care providers should have this information), an IGRA can be performed to evaluate eligibility.

Study participants have the option of donating blood via phlebotomy (for serological test for Covid-19 disease and PBMCs for immune correlates) or providing a fingerstick and dried blood spot (for serologic test for Covid-19).

Data will be collected at four time points/periods: (1) after consent, (2) at baseline, (3) during follow-up period, and (4) at study end.

Data to be collected during screening includes medical history, physical exam results, results of rt-PCR and serological test results.

Data to be collected during baseline enrollment includes eligibility confirmation, demographic information, risk factors, randomization assignment, confirmation of BCG vaccination/placebo, any immediate reactions to BCG vaccination/placebo.

Data to be collected during follow-up includes intermittent surveys about the presence of flu-like symptoms, rt-PCR test results if done, serological test results, if testing positive for Covid-19 information regarding their disease course, and disease outcome status.

FOLLOW-UP PROCEDURES AND DATA COLLECTION:

Participants will be followed to assess whether they get infected with SARS-CoV2:

Participants will complete intermittent surveys via an electronic system every 1-3 days to assess the presence of any flu-like symptom, including sore throat, fever, headache, malaise, and cough. Note that this is part of routine surveillance for Covid-19 in health workers at the United States site. Consent forms will ask for consent to access this survey information.

Any positive response on the survey will trigger a nasopharyngeal, oral and/ or rectal swab to be collected to test for Covid-19 via rt-PCR

All participants, regardless of survey responses, will have serology for Covid-19 tested at 4 week intervals during the follow-up period (6 months)

If a participant completes the follow-up period and does not test positive for disease, their study participation is complete

If a participant does test positive for disease, their disease status will be ascertained for up to two months or until an outcome is available through one of the following mechanisms: (1) an electronic survey if they are not admitted to the hospital, including questions about the number of days they are ill, daily fever, and other symptoms; or (2) (2) if they are admitted to the hospital, ordinal outcomes for disease severity will be extracted from the hospital¿s electronic medical records system.

During the first week of follow-up, all participants will actively be asked about any adverse events; thereafter, participants will report unsolicited AEs through the electronic survey. Vaccine related adverse events will be graded using the FDA guidance (https://www.fda.gov/media/73679/download) and noted using WHO-recommended Adverse event following Immunization forms (AEFI; https://vaccine-safety-training.org/classification-of-aefis.html).

Participants will have the option of donating 12 mL of blood for plasma (serology) and PBMCs for secondary analysis of immune correlates and for future analysis based on covid19-specific IgM and IgG. If they do not donate 12mL of blood, a fingerstick will be required for baseline COVID19 serology.

Dried Blood Spot (DBS): all participants are HCWs and will self-collect DBS samples at week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24. Envelopes to store the DBS are provided upon enrollment and can be dropped off at work and picked up by study coordinators to minimize HCW distractions.

COVID specific RNA is found in stool for ~21 days when an individual develops infection (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2196-x). Participants will have the option of collecting stool swabs monthly if they are asymptomatic or weekly if they develop symptoms. Nucleic acid testing will be performed in retrospect to support secondary objectives.

If participants develop symptoms consistent with COVD19, will be PCR tested for COVID19. They will be given the option of donating 12 mL of blood for plasma and PBMCs 2 weeks after symptoms resolve.

Week 12 (+/- 2 Weeks), participants will be given the option to donate 12 mL of blood for plasma and PBMCs for secondary analysis of immune correlates and for future secondary analysis based on covid-specific IgM and IgG.

Week 24 (+/- 2 Weeks), participants will be given the option to donate 12 mL of blood for plasma and

PBMCs for secondary analysis of immune correlates and for future secondary analysis based on covid-specific IgM and IgG.

Except for the administration of BCG vaccine or placebo and the above mentioned DBS and phlebotomy, participants will undergo no invasive procedures for study purposes.

The following data points will be collected during the follow-up period AND AT

As of 24:00 on January 26, 2020, there are 2744 confirmed cases and 461 severe cases in China, the number is still increasing. There is currently no vaccine and no specific antiviral treatment recommended for 2019-nCoV infection. About 20% of the patients were severe and some died of respiratory failure or multiple organ failure. Therefore, it is urgent to find a safe and effective therapeutic approach to pneumonia patients infected with 2019-nCoV. In the last year, the promising features of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), including their regenerative properties and ability to differentiate into diverse cell lineages, have generated great interest among researchers whose work has offered intriguing perspectives on cell-based therapies for various diseases. These findings seem to highlight that the beneficial effect of MSC-based treatment could be principally due by the immunomodulation and regenerative potential of these cells. The investigators found that infusions of UC-MSC significantly improved liver function in decompensated liver cirrhosis and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) patients, increased the survival rate in acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) patients . MSCs could significantly reduce the pathological changes of lung and inhibit the cell-mediated immune inflammatory response induced by influenza virus in animal model . The purpose of this study is to investigate safety and efficiency of MSCs in treating pneumonia patients infected with 2019-nCoV. This multi-center trial will recruit 20 patients. 10 patients received i.v. transfusion one round (3 times) of 3.0*10E7 cells of MSCs as the treated group, all of them received the conventional treatment. In addition, the equal 10 patients received conventional treatment were used as control.

There will be interim monitoring to introduce new arms and allow early stopping for futility, efficacy, or safety. If one therapy proves to be efficacious, this treatment will then become the control arm for comparison(s) with new experimental treatment(s). Because of the possibility that background standards of supportive care may evolve/improve over time as more is learned about successful management of COVID-19, comparisons of safety and efficacy will be based on data from concurrently randomized participants. An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will actively monitor interim data to make recommendations about early study closure or changes to study arms.

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04280705;detailed_description;This study is an adaptive, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of novel therapeutic agents in hospitalized adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The study is a multicenter trial that will be conducted in up to 50 sites globally. The study will be a series of 2-arm comparisons between different investigational therapeutic agents and a placebo. There will be interim monitoring to introduce new arms and allow early stopping for futility, efficacy, or safety. If one therapy proves to be efficacious, this treatment will then become the control arm for comparison(s) with new experimental treatment(s). Because of the possibility that background standards of supportive care may evolve/improve over time as more is learned about successful management of COVID-19, comparisons of safety and efficacy will be based on data from concurrently randomized participants. An independent data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will actively monitor interim data to make recommendations about early study closure or changes to study arms. Randomization will be stratified by: 1) site and 2) severity of illness at enrollment, severe disease (requiring mechanical ventilation or oxygen, a SpO2 </= 94% or tachypnea (respiratory rate >/= 24 breaths/min)) or mild-moderate disease (SpO2 > 94% and respiratory rate < 24 breaths/min without supplemental oxygen)). Subjects will be assessed daily while hospitalized. Discharged patients will be asked to attend study visits at Days 15, and 29. All subjects will undergo a series of efficacy, safety, and laboratory assessments. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of different investigational therapeutics relative to the control arm in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The secondary objectives of the study are to 1) evaluate the clinical efficacy of different investigational therapeutics as compared to the control arm as assessed by clinical severity, hospitalization, and mortality, and 2) evaluate the safety of the intervention through 28 days of follow-up as compared to the control arm.;"This study is an adaptive, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of novel therapeutic agents in hospitalized adults diagnosed with COVID-19. The study is a multicenter trial that will be conducted in up to approximately 100 sites globally. The study will compare different investigational therapeutic agents to a control arm. There will be interim monitoring to introduce new arms and allow early stopping for futility, efficacy, or safety. If one therapy proves to be efficacious, then this treatment may become the control arm for comparison(s) with new experimental treatment(s). Any such change would be accompanied by an updated sample size. Because background standards of supportive care may evolve/improve over time as more is learned about successful management of COVID-19, comparisons of safety and efficacy will be based on data from concurrently randomized subjects. An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will actively monitor interim data to make recommendations about early study closure or changes to study arms.

The initial sample size is projected to be 572 subjects to achieve 400 subjects with a ""recovered"" status (per the primary objective). The primary analysis will be based on those subjects enrolled in order to 400 recoveries. An additional analysis of the moderate severity subgroup (those with baseline status of ""Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen"" or ""Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring ongoing medical care"") is also of public health importance. Hence, enrollment will be permitted until the date of April 20, 2020 to ensure 400 recoveries and provide additional data about this important subgroup. With recent enrollment rates, the total sample size may be 600 to over 800.

Subjects will be assessed daily while hospitalized. If the subjects are discharged from the hospital, they will have a study visit at Days 15, 22, and 29 as an outpatient. For discharged subjects, it is preferred that the Day 15 and 29 visits are in person to obtain safety laboratory tests and OP swab and blood (serum only) samples for secondary research as well as clinical outcome data. However, infection control or other restrictions may limit the ability of the subject to return to the clinic. In this case, Day 15 and 29 visits may be conducted by phone, and only clinical data will be obtained. The Day 22 visit does not have laboratory tests or collection of samples and may also be conducted by phone.

All subjects will undergo a series of efficacy, safety, and laboratory assessments. Safety laboratory tests and blood (serum and plasma) research samples and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs will be obtained on Days 1 (prior to infusion) and Days 3, 5, 8, and 11 (while hospitalized). OP swabs and blood (serum only) plus safety laboratory tests will be collected on Day 15 and 29 (if the subject attends an in-person visit or are still hospitalized).

The primary outcome is time to recovery by Day 29. A key secondary outcome evaluates treatment-related improvements in the 8-point ordinal scale at Day 15. As little is known about the clinical course of COVID-19, a pilot study will be used for a blinded sample size reassessment."

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04252664;detailed_description;In December 2019, Wuhan, in Hubei province, China, became the center of an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause. In a short time, Chinese scientists had shared the genome information of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from these pneumonia patients and developed a real-time reverse transcription PCR (real time RT-PCR) diagnostic assay. Whilst the outbreak is likely to have started from a zoonotic transmission event associated with a large seafood market that also traded in live wild animals, it soon became clear that person-to-person transmission was also occurring. The number of cases of infection with 2019-nCoV identified in Wuhan increased markedly over the later part of January 2020, with cases identified in multiple other Provinces of China and internationally. Mathematical models of the expansion phase of the epidemic suggested that sustained person-to-person transmission is occurring, and the R-zero is substantially above 1, the level required for a self-sustaining epidemic in human populations. The clinical spectrum of 2019-nCoV infection appears to be wide, encompassing asymptomatic infection, a mild upper respiratory tract illness, and severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure and even death. Although the per infection risk of severe disease remains to be determined, and may differ from the initial reports of 10-15%, the large number of cases in Wuhan has resulted in a large number of patients hospitalised with pneumonia. Progression from prodromal symptoms (usually fever, fatigue, cough) to severe pneumonia requiring supplementary oxygen support, mechanical ventilation, or in some cases ECMO appears to occur most commonly during the second week of illness in association with persistent viral RNA detection. This provides a window of opportunity to test candidate antiviral therapeutics. This new coronavirus, and previous experiences with SARS and MERS-CoV, highlight the need for therapeutics for human coronavirus infections that can improve clinical outcomes, reduce risk of disease progression, speed recovery, and reduce the requirements for intensive supportive care and prolonged hospitalisation. In addition, treatments for mild cases to reduce the duration of illness and infectivity may also be of value were 2019-nCoV to become pandemic and/or endemic in human populations. Given no specific antiviral therapy for 2019-nCoV infection and the availability of remdesvir as a potential antiviral agent based on pre-clinical studies in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, this randomized, controlled, double blind trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of remdesivir in patients hospitalized with mild or moderate 2019-nCoV respiratory disease.;"In December 2019, Wuhan, in Hubei province, China, became the center of an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause.

Although the per infection risk of severe disease remains to be determined, and may differ from the initial reports of 10-15%, the large number of cases in Wuhan has resulted in a large number of patients hospitalised with pneumonia. Progression from prodromal symptoms (usually fever, fatigue, cough) to severe pneumonia requiring supplementary oxygen support, mechanical ventilation, or in some cases ECMO appears to occur most commonly during the second week of illness in association with persistent viral RNA detection. This provides a window of opportunity to test candidate antiviral therapeutics.

This new coronavirus, and previous experiences with SARS and MERS-CoV, highlight the need for therapeutics for human coronavirus infections that can improve clinical outcomes, reduce risk of disease progression, speed recovery, and reduce the requirements for intensive supportive care and prolonged hospitalisation. In addition, treatments for mild cases to reduce the duration of illness and infectivity may also be of value were COVID-19 to become pandemic and/or endemic in human populations.

Given no specific antiviral therapy for COVID-19 and the availability of remdesvir as a potential antiviral agent based on pre-clinical studies in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, this randomized, controlled, double blind trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of remdesivir in patients hospitalized with mild or moderate COVID-19."

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04316377;detailed_description;Chloroquine is one of two therapeutics (in addition to remdesivir) that has demonstrated in vitro inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2 and the drug is immediately available from national pharmacies. No delay is accordingly expected in treatment initiation after study commencement. In light of the evidence supporting chloroquine as a promising therapeutic in patients with COVID-19, the expected impact of the current proposal is considerable both in the short- and long-term. If successful, treatment with chloroquine has the potential to be the first evidence based treatment for COVID-19. The drug is affordable and the risk of side effects is low, making it an attractive therapeutic in large proportions of the population on a global scale. In the current proposal aims to investigate the virological and clinical effects of chloroquine treatment in patients with established SARS-CoV-2 in need of hospital admission. The investigators hypothesize that early treatment with chloroquine in patients with established COVID-19 is safe and will significantly improve prognosis and impact clinical outcomes. More specifically, the investigators hypothesize that early treatment with chloroquine will increase the virological clearance rate of SARS-CoV-2, and lead to more rapid resolve of clinical symptoms, decreased proportion of patients with clinical deterioration and a decreased admission rate to intensive care units and in-hospital mortality. Considering the immediate and worldwide health emergency associated with the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and the current lack of evidence based medical interventions for this patient group, studies investigating such possible treatment modalities in COVID-19 are direly needed. The study is a two-arm, open label, pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to assess the virological and clinical effect of chloroquine therapy in patients with established COVID-19. Pragmatic clinical trials are characterized by focus on informing decision-makers on optimal clinical medicine practice and an intent to streamline procedures and data collection in the trial. By utilizing resources already paid for by the hospitals (physicians and nurses in daily clinical practice), pragmatic clinical trials can include a larger number of patients at a short time duration and at a lower cost. Due to the immediate need for study commencement and the time frame of the current proposal, a pragmatic approach will enable swift initiation of randomization and treatment. Data will be extracted from the data warehouse at Akershus University Hospital for eligible patient identification (i.e. electronic surveillance) and for automatic data extraction to the study specific database. The study will not be able to procure an acceptable placebo treatment and the study will accordingly not be placebo-controlled. All patients at Akershus University Hospital with suspicion of acute respiratory tract infections are examined with a nasopharyngeal swab, with subsequent microbiological examination, including SARS-CoV-2 specific RT-PCR. Participants will be recruited from the entirety of the inpatients at the participating hospitals. Electronic real-time surveillance of laboratory reports from the Department of Microbiology will be examined regularly, with maximum interval 24 hours, for SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects. The study aims to include patients by a sequential adaptive approach, where analyses are planned after the inclusion of 51 patients, with subsequent analyses after 101, 151 and 202 completed patients. All patients included in each sequence will be used for the final analyses of the entire study. This approach will enable frequent assessment of all outcome measures. Data will be collected from the hospital electronic record system, including electronic patient records, laboratory and medical imaging systems, and prescribing systems. The data warehouse at Akershus University Hospital will be utilized for automatic data extraction to the study specific database.

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04286503;detailed_description;"1. Data management The electronic data collection system (EDC) will be used in this study for the collection and management of the study data to ensure the traceability of the clinical trial data; the data management process shall comply with the GCP specification to ensure the authenticity, integrity and accuracy of clinical trial data. The main data management processes are listed below. For other details, please refer to the data management plan (DMP). DMP is written by the data manager (DM) as the guiding document for data management. The data management work will be carried out according to the time, content and method defined by DMP. 1.1Design and establishment of database The data manager designs and constructs the database according to the trial protocol, and sets up the logic verification according to the data validation plan (DVP), which i released for use after passing the test and being approved by the investigator. 1.2Data entry The investigator or a person authorized by the investigator shall timely complete the online data entry after the subject visit, use the printed eCRF form first if necessary, and, in case of data correction in eCRF if required, fill in the reason for the data modification according to the system prompt. The logic validation program of the EDC system will logically check the input data and question the problem data, so as to facilitate the modification or interpretation by the investigator or the person authorized by the investigator. 1.3Source data validation (SDV) The investigator logs on EDC on the study site, 100% check the consistency of eCRF data and source data, and ask questions at any time in case of any problem. 1.4Data cleaning After investigator or the person authorized by the investigator enters the data to EDC according to the protocol requirements, the data manager and medical personnel shall review the data. The problems in the review shall be answered by the investigator or the person authorized by the investigator in the form of question until the question is closed. 1.5Medical coding The medical coder performs medical coding, including combined drugs and adverse events. Adverse events will be coded according to the MedDRA (20.0 or above) dictionary and the combined drugs will be classified by WHO ATC. During the coding process, DM can question the investigator online in real time about failure of coding caused by improper, inaccurate or ambiguous medical terms provided. A medical review is required for the medical coding before the database lock. 1.6External data management NA 1.7Data review meeting The study leader, statistician and data manager make the data review before statistical analysis to review the subject completion, protocol violation, adverse events, analysis data sets (including FAS, PPS and SS) to determine the attribution of each subject, judgment of missing value and treatment of outliers. Decisions made on the review meeting cannot be modified after the database lock, and any decisions must be documented. 1.8Electronic signature of investigator After the database is frozen, the investigator conducts electronic signature verification and shall sign the name again in case of data revision after signature. 1.9Data lock and export After the data in the database meets the quality requirements, a written approval document of database lock is signed by the data manager, statistical analyst and investigator representative according to the database lock procedures, exported by the data manager to the database of specified format and submitted to the statistician for statistical analysis. 2. Statistical analysis See the ""Statistical analysis plan"" for the details of the statistical analysis. The statistician and the principal investigator finalize the plan according to the data characteristics through discussion before the database lock. This protocol only describes the basic statistical analysis content, and the actual content shall be subject to the statistical analysis plan. 2.1Analysis data set 2.1.1Full Analysis Set (FAS): a set of all cases randomized to use the study drug at least once. 2.1.2Per Protocol Set (PPS): a data set generated by subjects who have fully complied with the trial protocol, including treatment received, availability of primary endpoint measurement, and no significant violation of the trial protocol. Cases withdrawn due to inefficacy will also be included in PPS. PPS will be subject to the final classification of the data audit report. 2.1.3Safety Set (SS): a set of subjects who receive at least one treatment with a safety evaluation after randomization. 2.2Missing data processing method 2.2.1The subjects who have missing primary efficiency indicators are filled in according to the treatment failure, that is, the pathogen nucleic acid testing in throat swabs, urine and stool on Days 7-14 after administration does not convert to negative. Unless otherwise specified, the secondary efficiency indicators shall be included as observed data in the statistical analysis, and the missing data shall not be filled in. 2.2.2The safety data shall not be filled in. 2.3Statistical method 2.3.1General principle Description of statistics: The primary indicators collected in this study are described with statistical method. Quantitative indicators are described by means of mean, standard deviation, median, quartile, maximum, minimum and the like; qualitative indicators are described by frequency, percentage and the like. Statistical test: Unless otherwise specified, the statistical significance level is 0.05 by two-sided test (one-sided 0.025) and the 95% confidence interval shall be provided for the estimation of inter-group variance parameters. 2.3.2Characteristics of cases Subject distribution The population and the number of enrolled and completed cases in each center are listed, and three analysis data sets (FAS, PPS, SS) are determined. A detailed list of the data set categories is made. The number and ratio of subjects who are randomly enrolled, complete the trial, and withdraw from the trial early and the reasons are calculated. The subject distribution flow chart is plotted. General information and baseline characteristics The demographic information, previous medication history and history of other diseases of the patients are described with statistical method. General information and baseline characteristics are described based on FAS. 2.3.3Analysis of drug exposure and drug combination Analysis based on SS. The drug exposure, dose intensity and exposure time of each group are calculated and subject to descriptive statistical analysis. The drug combination is coded by WHO ATC and summarized according to the ATC secondary classification and PT. The number and ratio of cases are calculated. 2.3.4Efficiency analysis Analysis based on FAS and PPS. Primary efficiency indicators: The primary effective indicators are complete antipyresis time, pulmonary imaging improvement indicators, and negative conversion ratio of pathogen nucleic acid testing in throat swabs, urine and stool on Days 7-14 after administration.The non-inferiority evaluation is based on FAS. The statistical significance level is set to one-sided 0.025 and the non-inferiority critical value is set to -10%. The negative conversion ratio of pathogen nucleic acid testing in throat swabs, urine and stool on Days 7-14 after administration in the trial group and positive control group is calculated respectively. The negative conversion ratio difference (trial group - control group) between the trial group and positive control group as well as the two-sided 95% confidence interval (95%CI) are calculated. The confidence interval is estimated by Miettinen-Nurminen. If the lower limit of 95% confidence interval for the negative conversion ratio difference between the trial group and control group is greater than -10%, it is considered that the trial drug for the indication is not inferior to the positive control drug. Given that the non-inferiority hypothesis is true, if it is further obtained that the lower limit of 95% confidence interval for the negative conversion ratio difference between the trial group and control group is greater than 0, it is considered that the trial drug for the indication is superior to the positive control drug. The inter-group ratio difference and confidence interval estimation results after the site effect control will be provided simultaneously as the sensitivity analysis and the sites with few subjects may be combined before analysis. Secondary efficiency indicators: The secondary efficiency indicators include negative conversion ratio of pathogen nucleic acid testing on Day 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14 after administration, negative conversion time, immune-related indicators (lymphocyte count, lymphocyte percentage, counts and percentages of CD4 and CD8), SOFA score, white blood cell count and C-reactive protein. The secondary efficiency indicators are subject to descriptive statistical analysis according to the data type. Where, for the quantitative data, the observed values in each visit and the changes in the observed values from baseline after treatment are analyzed descriptively and provided with the inter-group difference estimate value (trial group - control group) of the changes in indicators in different visits from baseline and its 95% confidence interval; for the qualitative data, the indicators in different visits are described in the form of a frequency table (frequency and percentage) and provided with the inter-group ratio difference and confidence interval estimate; for the survival data, such as the negative conversion time of pathogen nucleic acid testing and complete antipyresis time, the median complete antipyresis time and its 95% confidence interval in each group are calculated by Kaplan-Meier, the information on the subject deletions at the end of the study is provided and the survivorship curve is provided. The hazard ratio HR and its 90% confidence interval of the trail group and the control group are estimated by Cox proportional hazards regression. 2.3.5Safety analysis SS data sets are used for safety analysis. Adverse events are coded according to the MedDRA. The occurrence of adverse events/reactions, serious adverse events/reactions and adverse events/reactions resulting in drop out is summarized and analyzed in the form of a frequency table (number of cases, case, and incidence). The occurrence of varying severity orders of adverse events/reactions, serious adverse events/reactions and adverse events/reactions resulting in drop out is subject to descriptive statistical analysis in the form of a frequency table (number of cases, case, and incidence) according to SOC and PT. A detailed list of various adverse events/reactions, serious adverse events/reactions and adverse events/reactions resulting in drop out is made.

During the coding process, DM can question the investigator online in real time about failure of coding caused by improper, inaccurate or ambiguous medical terms provided.

A medical review is required for the medical coding before the database lock. 1.6External data management NA 1.7Data review meeting The study leader, statistician and data manager make the data review before statistical analysis to review the subject completion, protocol violation, adverse events, analysis data sets (including FAS, PPS and SS) to determine the attribution of each subject, judgment of missing value and treatment of outliers. Decisions made on the review meeting cannot be modified after the database lock, and any decisions must be documented.

1.8Electronic signature of investigator After the database is frozen, the investigator conducts electronic signature verification and shall sign the name again in case of data revision after signature.

1.9Data lock and export After the data in the database meets the quality requirements, a written approval document of database lock is signed by the data manager, statistical analyst and investigator representative according to the database lock procedures, exported by the data manager to the database of specified format and submitted to the statistician for statistical analysis.

Statistical analysis See the ""Statistical analysis plan"" for the details of the statistical analysis. The statistician and the principal investigator finalize the plan according to the data characteristics through discussion before the database lock. This protocol only describes the basic statistical analysis content, and the actual content shall be subject to the statistical analysis plan.

2.1Analysis data set 2.1.1Full Analysis Set (FAS): a set of all cases randomized to use the study drug at least once.

2.1.2Per Protocol Set (PPS): a data set generated by subjects who have fully complied with the trial protocol, including treatment received, availability of primary endpoint measurement, and no significant violation of the trial protocol. Cases withdrawn due to inefficacy will also be included in PPS. PPS will be subject to the final classification of the data audit report.

2.1.3Safety Set (SS): a set of subjects who receive at least one treatment with a safety evaluation after randomization.

2.2Missing data processing method 2.2.1The subjects who have missing primary efficiency indicators are filled in according to the treatment failure, that is, the pathogen nucleic acid testing in throat swabs, urine and stool on Days 7-14 after administration does not convert to negative. Unless otherwise specified, the secondary efficiency indicators shall be included as observed data in the statistical analysis, and the missing data shall not be filled in.

2.2.2The safety data shall not be filled in. 2.3Statistical method 2.3.1General principle

Description of statistics:

The primary indicators collected in this study are described with statistical method. Quantitative indicators are described by means of mean, standard deviation, median, quartile, maximum, minimum and the like; qualitative indicators are described by frequency, percentage and the like.

Statistical test:

Unless otherwise specified, the statistical significance level is 0.05 by two-sided test (one-sided 0.025) and the 95% confidence interval shall be provided for the estimation of inter-group variance parameters.

2.3.2Characteristics of cases Subject distribution The population and the number of enrolled and completed cases in each center are listed, and three analysis data sets (FAS, PPS, SS) are determined.

A detailed list of the data set categories is made. The number and ratio of subjects who are randomly enrolled, complete the trial, and withdraw from the trial early and the reasons are calculated.

The subject distribution flow chart is plotted. General information and baseline characteristics The demographic information, previous medication history and history of other diseases of the patients are described with statistical method. General information and baseline characteristics are described based on FAS.

2.3.3Analysis of drug exposure and drug combination Analysis based on SS. The drug exposure, dose intensity and exposure time of each group are calculated and subject to descriptive statistical analysis.

The drug combination is coded by WHO ATC and summarized according to the ATC secondary classification and PT. The number and ratio of cases are calculated.

2.3.4Efficiency analysis Analysis based on FAS and PPS.

Primary efficiency indicators:

The primary effective indicators are complete antipyresis time, pulmonary imaging improvement indicators, and negative conversion ratio of pathogen nucleic acid testing in throat swabs, urine and stool on Days 7-14 after administration.The non-inferiority evaluation is based on FAS. The statistical significance level is set to one-sided 0.025 and the non-inferiority critical value is set to -10%. The negative conversion ratio of pathogen nucleic acid testing in throat swabs, urine and stool on Days 7-14 after administration in the trial group and positive control group is calculated respectively. The negative conversion ratio difference (trial group - control group) between the trial group and positive control group as well as the two-sided 95% confidence interval (95%CI) are calculated. The confidence interval is estimated by Miettinen-Nurminen. If the lower limit of 95% confidence interval for the negative conversion ratio difference between the trial group and control group is greater than -10%, it is considered that the trial drug for the indication is not inferior to the positive control drug. Given that the non-inferiority hypothesis is true, if it is further obtained that the lower limit of 95% confidence interval for the negative conversion ratio difference between the trial group and control group is greater than 0, it is considered that the trial drug for the indication is superior to the positive control drug. The inter-group ratio difference and confidence interval estimation results after the site effect control will be provided simultaneously as the sensitivity analysis and the sites with few subjects may be combined before analysis.

Secondary efficiency indicators:

The secondary efficiency indicators include negative conversion ratio of pathogen nucleic acid testing on Day 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14 after administration, negative conversion time, immune-related indicators (lymphocyte count, lymphocyte percentage, counts and percentages of CD4 and CD8), SOFA score, white blood cell count and C-reactive protein. The secondary efficiency indicators are subject to descriptive statistical analysis according to the data type. Where, for the quantitative data, the observed values in each visit and the changes in the observed values from baseline after treatment are analyzed descriptively and provided with the inter-group difference estimate value (trial group - control group) of the changes in indicators in different visits from baseline and its 95% confidence interval; for the qualitative data, the indicators in different visits are described in the form of a frequency table (frequency and percentage) and provided with the inter-group ratio difference and confidence interval estimate; for the survival data, such as the negative conversion time of pathogen nucleic acid testing and complete antipyresis time, the median complete antipyresis time and its 95% confidence interval in each group are calculated by Kaplan-Meier, the information on the subject deletions at the end of the study is provided and the survivorship curve is provided. The hazard ratio HR and its 90% confidence interval of the trail group and the control group are estimated by Cox proportional hazards regression.

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04276896;detailed_description;Background: The 2019 discovered new coronavirus, Covid-19, is an enveloped positive strand single strand RNA virus. The number of Covid-19 infected people has increased rapidly and WHO has warned that the spread of Covid-19 may soon become pandemic and have disastrous outcomes. Covid-19 could pose a serious threat to human health and global economy. There is no vaccine available or clinically approved antiviral therapy as yet. This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of treating Covid-19 infections with a novel lentiviral based DC and T cell vaccines. Objective: Primary study objectives: Injection and infusion of LV-SMENP DC and antigen-specific cytotoxic T cell vaccines to healthy volunteers and Covid-19 infected patients to evaluate the safety. Secondary study objectives: To evaluate the anti- Covid-19 efficacy of the LV-SMENP DC and antigen-specific cytotoxic T cell vaccines. Design: 1. Based on the genomic sequence of the new coronavirus Covid-19, select conserved and critical structural and protease protein domains to engineer lentiviral SMENP minigenes to express Covid-19 antigens. 2. LV-SMENP-DC vaccine is made by modifying DC with lentivirus vectors expressing Covid-19 minigene SMENP and immune modulatory genes. CTLs will be activated by LV-DC presenting Covid-19 specific antigens. 3. LV-DC vaccine and antigen-specific CTLs are prepared in 7~21 days. Subject will receive total 5x10^6 cells of LV-DC vaccine and 1x10^8 antigen-specific CTLs via sub-cutaneous injection and IV infusion, respectively. Patients are followed weekly for one month after the infusion, monthly for 3 months, and then every 3 months until the trial ends.;"Background: The 2019 discovered new coronavirus, Covid-19, is an enveloped positive strand single strand RNA virus.

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04334460;detailed_description;"Calpains are a class of non-lysosomal cysteine proteases involved in diverse cellular processes. Several independent publications indicate that specific host cellular proteases called dimeric calpains are essential for the replication of multiple RNA viruses including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-1. In 2004, Barnard and colleagues described that the inhibition of calpains 1 and 2 by distinct calpain inhibitors, MDL 28170 and SJA 6017, resulted in anti-SARS-CoV activity by reducing infectious virus particle replication and hence production (Barnard, 2004). This observation was reproduced with MDL 28170, which showed a >7-log reduction in SARS-CoV replication in cell culture systems (Schneider, 2012). The anti-viral activity of the compound was confirmed to be due to inhibition of m calpain by utilizing a small interfering RNA (siRNA) approach to selectively silence expression of this dimeric calpain isoform. This confirmed the specific requirement for dimeric m calpain activity during SARS-CoV replication in vitro (Schneider, 2012). MDL 28170 is a nonclinical tool calpain inhibitor compound with known off-target liabilities that has not been evaluated in nonclinical or clinical safety studies.

It has been shown that the receptor for SARS-CoV-1 and -2 entry into the cell is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) (Kuba, 2010). ACE-2 and the dimeric calpains (data on file) are co-expressed in respiratory epithelial cells, the site of both viral entry and predominant early lung injury in COVID-19.

In addition to the potential for anti-viral activity by calpain inhibition, nonclinical animal bleomycin lung injury models demonstrated that BLD-2660 normalized tissue IL-6 levels, a proinflammatory cytokine demonstrated to be elevated in COVID-19 patients and is implicated in disease pathogenesis. This pro-inflammatory cytokine has been shown to contribute to lung damage during SARS-CoV infection and the virus itself is capable of directly inducing its expression (Bozym, 2011; Yoon, 2008). Thus BLD-2660 could potentially reduce both viral replication and the nonproductive host-response to infection, both contributors to morbidity and mortality in COVID-19.

BLD2660, has shown greater selectivity for calpain inhibition than MDL 28170, the prototypic calpain inhibitor utilized to effectively inhibit SARS-CoV replication. BLD-2660 lacks cross-reactivity with other cysteine proteases such as cathepsins. The safety and tolerability of BLD-2660 has been demonstrated in the recently completed Phase 1 single ascending dose (SAD)/multiple ascending dose (MAD) B-2660-101 study.

This study will evaluate BLD-2660 as an add-on therapy to standard of care (SOC) in hospitalized subjects with recent diagnosis of COVID-19.";"Interleukin 6 (IL-6), a proinflammatory cytokine, is a key driver of a cytokine storm that plays a significant role in clinical complications and acute lung injury. Emerging data indicate that serum levels of IL-6 are elevated in COVID-19 patients and are predictive of respiratory failure and mortality. IL-6 has been shown to contribute to lung damage during SARS-CoV infection and the virus itself is capable of directly inducing its expression. Suppression of pro-inflammatory IL-6 have been shown to have a therapeutic effect in many inflammatory diseases, including viral infections.

In a mouse model of lung injury employing bleomycin, BLD-2660, at therapeutic doses of 30 and 100 mg/kg twice per day (BID), reduced IL-6 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. BLD-2660 also attenuated fibrosis damage as measured by significant reductions in the alpha smooth muscle actin and collagen 1 in lung tissue. BLD-2660 also demonstrated target engagement by inhibiting cleavage of one of its substrates, spectrin, in bronchoalveolar cells.

BLD-2660 was also evaluated in a mouse model of NASH fibrosis, demonstrating an anti-fibrotic effect. A significant decrease in IL-6 transcription was also observed. This suggests that the effect of BLD-2660 on IL-6 is independent of the injury, or the affected organ.

It has been shown that the receptor for SARS-CoV-1 and -2 entry into the cell is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2). ACE-2 and the dimeric calpains (data on file) are co-expressed in respiratory epithelial cells, the site of both viral entry and predominant early lung injury in COVID-19. Inhibition of dimeric calpain activity has not been associated with impairment of normal immune function. The safety and tolerability of BLD-2660 has been demonstrated in the recently completed Phase 1 single ascending dose (SAD)/multiple ascending dose (MAD) B-2660-101 study.

As BLD-2660 has been demonstrated to (1) reduce tissue IL-6 levels and (2) attenuate lung fibrosis damage, it could therefore, potentially reduce the nonproductive IL-6 mediated host-response to infection, which contribute to morbidity and mortality in COVID-19. In addition, data suggest that survivors of SARS-CoV-2 infection are at risk for chronic impairment of pulmonary function, likely attributable to pulmonary fibrosis secondary to lung injury and inflammation. Although there is not yet available data documenting numbers of patients infected with SARS CoV2 pneumonia who progress to pulmonary fibrosis, epidemiology, viral immunology, and current clinical evidence support that pulmonary fibrosis may become one of the serious long-term complications of survivors of COVID-19 related pneumonia.

Thus, BLD-2660 could not only potentially downregulate the nonproductive host-response to infection, which contributes to morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 but also could reduce potential long-term fibrosis and loss of pulmonary function resulting from SARS-CoV pneumonia.

Treatment will be comprised of etoposide administered intravenously at a dose of 150 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 4 as prevention of cytokine storm in patients with COVID-19 infection.

The rationale for the use of etoposide to treat the cytokine storm in COVID-19 is the high mortality associated with the hyperinflammatory response to the virus, which is similar to that seen in other secondary types of Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Early use of etoposide has been shown to improve survival in secondary Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Etoposide is an already FDA approved drug that is comparably inexpensive and currently available. At Boston Medical Center, the investigators are trending daily inflammatory markers in patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19. The investigators propose a Phase II study of etoposide for the prevention and treatment of cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 infection.";"This is a randomized, open-label phase II study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of etoposide in patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection.

Autopsy studies of Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID patients show a high number of cytolytic T cells in the lungs of such patients. Early autopsy results of COVID patients at Boston Medical Center demonstrate significant hemophagocytosis in lymph nodes and spleen. Comparable studies in the related coronavirus infection severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have demonstrated hemophagocytosis, a hallmark of HLH.15 By targeting the T cells and monocytes driving the cytokine storm in patients with the more severe forms of COVID infection, we hope to alleviate the progression of lung and multi-organ dysfunction characteristic of patients who die from this illness."

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04305106;brief_summary;The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a new strain of coronavirus found in the human body in 2019. Its infectious disease causes a public health crisis. Novel coronavirus pneumonia is a common respiratory disorder. The treatment is high respiratory oxygen therapy, noninvasive mechanical ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation and other clinical respiratory support therapies, but there is no specific drug. Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody. As an anti VEGF drug, bevacizumab has been used in anti-tumor treatment for nearly 20 years, and its safety is well guaranteed. Among the adverse reactions, hypertension, fatigue or fatigue, diarrhea and abdominal pain were the most frequent. The most serious adverse reactions reported were gastrointestinal perforation, hemorrhage and arterial thromboembolism, but the incidence was relatively low. In February 15, 2020, a novel coronavirus pneumonia trial was conducted in 11 patients with severe and severe new crown pneumonia. It suggested that bevacizumab plus conventional therapy was effective in treating dyspnea symptoms in patients with new coronary artery pneumonia, and no obvious adverse reactions were observed. The aim of novel coronavirus pneumonia is to investigate the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab in the treatment of severe and severe new crown pneumonia with dyspnea and diffuse pulmonary lesions. The subjects were randomly divided into intervention group and control group. On the basis of routine treatment, bevacizumab or placebo were given at the 24th hour after admission to the group. Blood gas analysis, laboratory examination and chest imaging examination were performed after administration to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of bevacizumab.;The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a new strain of coronavirus found in human in 2019, which causes epidemic worldwide. Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) causes acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the severe and critically severe patients. Pulmonary edema is the key detrimental feature of ALI/ARDS. Autopsy of patients died from COVID-19 reported that, pulmonary mucus exudation was severe, more obvious than SARS infection. Pulmonary CT scanning and pathological findings also suggest that pulmonary edema caused by inflammatory exudation is a distinguished feature of COVID-19. However, specific pharmacotherapy is lacking.Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is known as the most potent inducing factors to increase vascular permeability. Bevacizumab is an anti VEGF recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody, which has been used in anti-tumor treatment for 16 years. Evidence suggest that Bevacizumab is a promising drug for severe and critical COVID-19 patients.

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04344587;detailed_description;The COVID-19 smArtphone-based Trial of Non-ICU Admission Prone Positioning (CATNAP) Study is a pragmatic adaptive randomized controlled unblinded trial. CATNAP randomizes non-ICU patients with COVID-19 or who are under evaluation for COVID-19 to lie in a prone position (i.e, with their stomach and chest facing down) or to usual care.;"The purpose of this multi-site trial is to investigate the use of prone positioning in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who are not intubated. The APPEX-19 study is a pragmatic adaptive randomized controlled unblinded trial. The study compares a smartphone tool that recommends non-ICU patients with COVID-19 or who are under evaluation for COVID-19 to lie in a prone position (i.e, with their stomach and chest facing down) to usual care.

Participants who are assigned to the intervention arm will receive a text message containing a link to an online website that reviews how to safely self-prone position and a recommendation to self-prone position 4 times for 1-2 hours each during the day and at night every 24 hours. Participants will also receive twice daily reminders to self-prone using the same smartphone platform.

All participants will receive twice daily Qualtrics online surveys to answer questions about which body positions they used in bed and their level of comfort and shortness of breath. Participants will receive these twice daily text messages until they are discharged, until they are transferred to the ICU, until they die, until their lung function declines, or until 14 days pass since enrollment. Thus, most participants will receive twice daily text messages for about 1 week; it is expected that almost all patients will receive twice daily text messages for no longer than 14 days. Medical charts will be reviewed daily to track routine clinical data to determine outcomes.

Boston Medical Center (BMC) / Boston University will be one of the 16 sites and the data coordinating center for this multisite trial. The unique design of the study means that if evidence accumulates that one treatment is better than the other, more participants will be chosen to receive the prone position intervention that works over time. Thus, the trial will both show what works, implement what works, and make sure that the most participants receive the treatment that works."

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04341688;brief_summary;"Pakistan is a resource restraint country, it's not possible to carry out coronavirus testing at mass scale. Owing to the aerosol producing nature of the dental profession, carrying out dental work on asymptomatic patients carrying coronavirus puts the entire dental team at a great risk of not only acquiring the infection but also transmitting it to the others.

Identifying an antiviral gargle that could substantially reduce the colonies of COVID-19 residing in mouth and oro-pharynx is likely to reduce the viral load. This topical therapy is speculated to substantially reduce the transmission of infection in micro-aerosol generated in the dental practice. Such topical anti-viral therapy could also help to improve the overall symptoms of the patient. Given the apparent mechanical rather than blood-borne slow advance of coronavirus from nasopharnyx to lung, the possibility exists that reducing viral load through debriding could aid effective immune response in the same way that debriding burns reduces time of healing.";"Pakistan is a resource restraint country, it's not possible to carry out coronavirus testing at mass scale. Simple cost effective intervention against the present pandemic is highly desirable.

For patients: Identifying an antiviral gargle that could substantially reduce the colonies of COVID-19 residing in mouth and oro-naso-pharynx is likely to reduce the viral load. Such reduction in the viral load through surface debridement could aid the effective immune response in improving the overall symptoms of the patients.

For dentists: This study is important because the nature of the dental profession involves aerosol production, carrying out dental work on asymptomatic patients carrying coronavirus puts the entire dental team at a great risk of not only acquiring the infection but also transmitting it to the others. Antiviral gargles could be used by dentist and their auxiliaries as prophylaxis.

For physicians and nurses: The risk of morbidity and mortality is high among physicians and nurses involved in the screening and management of Covid-19 patients. Globally, over 215 physicians and surgeons have died while taking care of Covid-19 patients. The cause of death is attributed to high exposure of viral load. The antiviral gargles and nasal lavage can decrease the fatalities among doctors and nurses.

Thus, patients, physicians, nurses and dentists, all could be benefited with this findings of this study."

Molecular and immunological testing will be done at the Juma laboratory of AKUH. The intervention drugs (Povidone-Iodine, Hydogen Peroxide and Hypertonic Saline will be obtained from the AKUH distribution department and/ or AKUH pharmacy. The Neem extract will be compounded at the Chemistry department, University of Karachi/ HEJ institute of Organic Chemistry, University of Karachi.

It will be a pilot study, so will need just 40 patients. There will be four groups. Group A (n=10) patients on 10 ml gargle and nasal lavage with of 0.2% Povidone-Iodine for 20-30 seconds, twice daily for 5 days.

Group D (n=10) patients will use 2% hypertonic saline gargle and nasal lavage for a similar time period.

Data collection: The baseline oral swab will be taken from the posterior pharyngeal wall on day one before initiating the gargles by trained dentist. The end-point oral swab will be taken on day 5, just after using the prescribed gargle. Patient will be provided with a special hood so that they themselves don't generate aerosol in the immediate vicinity while carrying out the gargling and nasal lavage.

Data will be analyzed using SPSS for Windows (version 20.0 SPSS) and Graph Pad (Prism) softwares. Mean and standard deviation of the continuous variables (age, COVID-19 viral counts at baseline and endpoint etc.) will be computed. Frequency distribution of the categorical variables will be determined (gender, co-morbids, presence of hypertension, diabetes, periodontal status etc.) Repeated measures ANOVA will be used to compare the reduction in intra-oral viral loads and the change in inflammatory biomarkers in the four study groups.

Its use will be thoroughly explained by the data collection officer.

Data collection: The baseline oral swab will be taken from the posterior pharyngeal wall/ tonsillar area on day one before initiating the gargles by trained dentist. The end-point oral swab will be taken on day 7, just after using the prescribed gargle. Patient will be provided with a special hood so that they themselves don't generate aerosol in the immediate vicinity while carrying out the gargling and nasal lavage.

Data will be analyzed using SPSS for Windows (version 23.0 SPSS) and Graph Pad Prism 7.0 software.

Mean and standard deviation of the continuous variables (age, COVID-19 viral counts and cytokine profiles at baseline and endpoint etc.) will be computed. Frequency distribution of the categorical variables will be determined (gender, co-morbids, presence of hypertension, diabetes, periodontal status etc.) Repeated measures ANOVA will be used to compare the reduction in intra-oral viral load and the changes in the inflammatory biomarkers in the study groups. In case of substantially low count of participants in the study groups, non-parametric tests such as Kruskal-Wallis or Friedman test will be employed. Multiple linear regression (MLR) will done to predict changes in the Covid-19 viral load and cytokine profiles. A subset analysis using Zero inflated negative binomial (ZINB) model will be employed, provided a significant reduction in viral load is observed in any of the study groups. A p-value of <0.05 will be taken as statistically significant. {20a}

The biases and confounders can be taken care at following four levels:

At recruitment stage, we will use restriction i.e. only those COVID positive subjects will be recruited who have no other major co-morbidities. At intervention assignment, the random group allocation will ensure even distribution of the confounders in the study groups thus their differential effect on the outcome will be addressed. At analysis, we will employ regression analysis (as described above) to account for biases and confounders and lastly, the subset analysis will stratify the data and nullify the effect of biases.

Interim analysis {20b} is not planned on account of a short duration of the study. Missing data/ uncompliant patients {20c} will be omitted from the final analysis."

COVID-19 caused clusters of severe respiratory illness and was associated with 2% mortality. There is currently no vaccine and no specific antiviral treatment recommended for COVID-19. About 20% of the patients were severe and the mainstay of clinical management is largely symptomatic treatment, with organ support in intensive care for seriously ill patients. Therefore, it is urgent to find a safe and effective therapeutic approach to COVID-19. In the last years, the promising features of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), including their regenerative properties and ability to differentiate into diverse cell lineages, have generated great interest among researchers whose work has offered intriguing perspectives on cell-based therapies for various diseases. These findings seem to highlight that the beneficial effect of MSC-based treatment could be principally due by the immunomodulation and regenerative potential of these cells. MSCs could significantly reduce the pathological changes of lung and inhibit the cell-mediated immune inflammatory response induced by influenza virus in animal model . MSCs has been shown to reduce nonproductive inflammation and affect tissue regeneration and is being evaluated in patients with ARDS. Our phase I preliminary data of parallel assignment study(NCT04252118) showed that three doses of MSCs was safe in patients with COVID-19.

B38-CAP is a bacteria-derived ACE2-like enzyme that suppresses hypertension and cardiac dysfunction Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is critically involved in cardiovascular physiology and pathology, and is currently clinically evaluated to treat acute lung failure. Here we show that the B38-CAP, a carboxypeptidase derived from Paenibacillus sp. B38, is an ACE2-like enzyme to decrease angiotensin II levels in mice. In protein 3D structure analysis, B38-CAP homolog shares structural similarity to mammalian ACE2 with low sequence identity. In vitro, recombinant B38-CAP protein catalyzed the conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7, as well as other known ACE2 target peptides. Treatment with B38-CAP suppressed angiotensin II-induced hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and fibrosis in mice. Moreover, B38-CAP inhibited pressure overload-induced pathological hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis, and cardiac dysfunction in mice. Our data identify the bacterial B38-CAP as an ACE2-like carboxypeptidase, indicating that evolution has shaped a bacterial carboxypeptidase to a human ACE2-like enzyme. Bacterial engineering could be utilized to design improved protein drugs for hypertension and heart failure.On the contraryTreatment with recombinant human ACE2 protein (rhACE2), which is devoid of its membrane-anchored domain thus soluble, has been demonstrated to exhibit beneficial effects in various animal models including heart failure, acute lung injury, and diabetic nephropathy, and so forth. rhACE2 is currently tested in the clinic to treat ARDS and COVID-19 infected patients . Using cell cultures and organoids, researchers from the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden and the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Canada, showed that by adding a genetically modified variant of ACE2, called human recombinant soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hrsACE2), COVID-19 was prevented from entering cells.The paper, published in Cell, shows that hrsACE2 had a dose dependent effect of viral growth of SARS-CoV-2 and was able to reduce it by a factor of 1,000 to 5,000 in cell cultures. Despite its beneficial effects, rhACE2 is a glycosylated protein and thus its preparation requires time- and cost-consuming protein expression system with mammalian or insect cells, which may not be advantageous in drug development and medical economy Although it had been reported that an immune response is associated with the chronic infusion of rhACE2 resulting in the degradation of rhACE226, this was not observed for B38-CAP; there were no antibodies against B38-CAP detectable in the serum of mice infused with B38-CAP for 2 weeks. Implantation of B38-CAP-filled osmotic mini-pumps significantly suppressed Ang II-induced hypertension in conscious mice .without affecting the heart rate. These results indicate that B38-CAP antagonizes the vasopressor effect of Ang II. So the principle investigator expects and suggests that treating with cloned Bacterial ACE2 receptors -like enzyme of B38-CAP could be promising COVID-19 infection- and lung injury preventing drug better than recombinant human ACE2 in addition to brsACE2, expected to lure the virus to attach itself to the copy instead of the actual cells… It distracts the virus from infecting the cells to the same degree and should lead to a reduction in the growth of the virus in the lungs and other organs. A study showed that recombinant B38-CAP protein downregulates Ang II levels in mice and antagonizes Ang II-induced hypertension, pathological cardiac hypertrophy, and myocardial fibrosis. We also show beneficial effects of B38-CAP on the pathology of pressure overload-induced heart failure in mice without overt toxicities.

Implantation of B38-CAP-filled osmotic mini-pumps significantly suppressed Ang II-induced hypertension in conscious mice .without affecting the heart rate. These results indicate that B38-CAP antagonizes the vasopressor effect of Ang II.

We also show beneficial effects of B38-CAP on the pathology of pressure overload-induced heart failure in mice without overt toxicities.Finally the principal investigator expect that treatment with ACE2-like enzyme in bacteria B38-CAP may be do the same mechanism of rhACE2 in inhibiting COVID -19 and the other suggested mechanism is that injection of ACE2-like enzyme of bacteria B38-CAP in human body may down regulate human ACE2 which is the real receptor of COVID -19 and in the same time it will be resistant to COVID- spike protein because there seems a difference in substrate specificity between two enzymes.

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04257656;detailed_description;In December 2019, Wuhan, in Hubei province, China, became the center of an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause. In a short time, Chinese scientists had shared the genome information of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from these pneumonia patients and developed a real-time reverse transcription PCR (real time RT-PCR) diagnostic assay. Whilst the outbreak is likely to have started from a zoonotic transmission event associated with a large seafood market that also traded in live wild animals, it soon became clear that person-to-person transmission was also occurring. The number of cases of infection with 2019-nCoV identified in Wuhan increased markedly over the later part of January 2020, with cases identified in multiple other Provinces of China and internationally. Mathematical models of the expansion phase of the epidemic suggested that sustained person-to-person transmission is occurring, and the R-zero is substantially above 1, the level required for a self-sustaining epidemic in human populations. The clinical spectrum of 2019-nCoV illness appears to be wide, encompassing asymptomatic infection, a mild upper respiratory tract infection, and severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure and even death. Although the per infection risk of severe disease remains to be determined, case-fatality risk of 11-14% has been reported in several initial studies of seriously ill patients and case-fatality has been estimated approximately at 2% overall. Also the large number of cases in Wuhan has resulted in a large number of patients hospitalised with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen and sometimes more advance ventilator support. This new coronavirus, and previous experiences with SARS and MERS-CoV, highlight the need for therapeutics for human coronavirus infections that can improve clinical outcomes, speed recovery, and reduce the requirements for intensive supportive care and prolonged hospitalisation. Given no specific antiviral therapy for 2019-nCoV infection and the ready availability of remdesvir as a potential antiviral agent, based on pre-clinical studies in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, this randomized, controlled, double blind trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of remdesivir in patients hospitalized with severe 2019-nCoV respiratory disease.;"In December 2019, Wuhan, in Hubei province, China, became the center of an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause.

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04343989;detailed_description;"The limited understanding of the clinical behavior of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (the viral organism responsible for COVID-19 disease) is evolving on a daily basis. Reports from China indicate that a subset of patients with the worst clinical outcomes may manifest cytokine storm syndrome. Hypotheses that excess cytokines may trigger a secondary hemophagocytic lymphhistiocytosis (sHLH) have been proposed. Indeed, cytokine profiles consistent with this picture were observed in Chinese patients with severe pulmonary involvement. Specifically, elevated ferritin and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were associated with fatalities among the infected patients. A role for targeted anti-inflammatory and anti-cytokine therapies in the treatment of pulmonary hyperinflammation has been proposed.

Clazakizumab is a genetically engineered humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds with high affinity to human IL-6. This investigational agent is currently being studied as a treatment for chronic active antibody mediated rejection of renal allografts.

In this study we propose to administer clazakizumab to patients with life-threatening pulmonary failure secondary to COVID-19 disease.";"The limited understanding of the clinical behavior of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (the viral organism responsible for COVID-19 disease) is evolving on a daily basis.

Late stages of COVID-19 can be marked by a ""cytokine storm"" and the overactivation of inflammatory myeloid cells that infiltrate and damage tissue, such as the lungs. Inhibition of GM-CSF may be able to reverse this pathology. The anti-GM-CSF mechanism is distinct from antiviral therapeutic mechanisms and may provide synergistic effects when used in combination.

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04372589;brief_summary;The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic-dose parenteral heparin versus usual care in hospitalized COVID-19 patients (e.g. reduced intubation, mortality).;"Endothelial injury as a consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to a dysregulated host inflammatory response and activation of coagulation pathways. Macro- and micro-vascular thrombosis may contribute to morbidity, organ failure, and death. Therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin may improve clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 through anti-thrombotic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-viral activities of heparins. This pragmatic, Bayesian adaptive randomized controlled trial will determine whether therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin (subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin or intravenous unfractionated heparin) versus usual care reduces the need for intubation or death in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 not initially requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. The trial uses an adaptive design which was chosen to overcome limitations in available data to inform a priori estimation of event rates and possible effect sizes. The adaptive design also includes response-adaptive randomization based on baseline D-dimer level, probing for differential efficacy across subgroups defined based on initial D-dimer level. This Bayesian adaptive randomized trial will stop at a conclusion 1) when the posterior probability that the proportional odds ratio is greater than 1.0 reaches 99% (definition of benefit); 2) when the posterior probability that the proportional odds ratio is greater than 1.2 is less than 10% (definition of futility) or; 3) when the posterior probability that the proportional odds ratio is less than 1.0 is greater than 90% (definition of harm). The trial will enroll a maximum of 3,000 patients, although in many simulations the trial may require fewer patients. The trial is strategically aligned with the international REMAP-CAP/COVID platform trial to accelerate evidence generation."

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04355364;detailed_description;"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is the most severe form of COVID-19 with a mortality reaching 50%. To date, no specific therapy has been shown to be effective. During an acute viral respiratory infection, lungs are the site of an intense neutrophil recruitment. Recruited neutrophils generate NETs (extracellular neutrophil traps) in the alveoli and bronchioles. NETs have been shown to be involved in bronchoalveolar congestion and amplification of the inflammatory response during viral pneumonia responsible for ARDS. Deoxyribonuclease 1 (DNAse 1) is an enzyme capable of cutting apart extracellular DNA strands, the backbone of NETs. The administration of recombinant human DNAse 1 (dornase alpha) leads to the loosening of the broncho-alveolar mucus and to a reduction in the inflammatory response within the alveoli.

By conducting a randomized, open-label, multicenter, controlled trial, our goal is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aerosolized intra-tracheal dornase alpha administration in mechanically ventilated patients hospitalized for COVID19-related ARDS.

This is a randomized, controlled, multicentric, open-label clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intra-tracheal dornase alpha administration in mechanically ventilated, intensive care hospitalized patients with COVID19-related ARDS.

Dornase Alpha is a FDA-approved drug for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, which facilitates mucus clearance by cutting apart neutrophil-derived extracellular double-stranded DNA. This study intends to define the impact of aerosolized intra-tracheal Dornase Alpha administration on the severity and progression of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients. This drug might make lung mucus thinner and looser, promoting improved clearance of secretions and reduce extracellular double-stranded DNA-induced hyperinflammation in alveoli, preventing further damage to the lungs.

The study will recruit mechanically ventilated patients hospitalized in ICU who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and meet ARDS criteria. It is a prospective, randomized, controlled, multicentric, open-label clinical trial.

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04311697;brief_summary;Novel Corona Virus (COVID-19) is known to cause Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, that results in mortality in 35% - 50% of affected patients, despite intensive care and mechanical ventilation. Patients with COVID-19 induced Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome who are admitted for intensive care including endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation will be treated with Aviptadil, a synthetic version of Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP) and compared to historical controls. Patients will be randomized to intravenous Aviptadil with escalation to nebulized Aviptadil vs. nebulized Aviptadil with escalation to intravenous Aviptadil.;Novel Corona Virus (SARS-CoV-2) is known to cause Respiratory Failure, which is the hallmark of Acute COVID-19, as defined by the new NIH/FDA classification. Approximately 50% of those who develop Critical COVID-19 die, despite intensive care and mechanical ventilation. Patients with Critical COVID-19 and respiratory failure, currently treated with high flow nasal oxygen, non-invasive ventilation or mechanical ventilation will be treated with Aviptadil, a synthetic form of Human Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP) plus maximal intensive care vs. placebo + maximal intensive care. Patients will be randomized to intravenous Aviptadil will receive escalating doses from 50 -150 pmol/kg/hr over 12 hours.

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04311697;detailed_description;Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome is a known lethal complication of Corona Virus (COVID-19) infection. Conventional medical therapy, including intensive care and respiratory support is associated with a 35%-50% mortality. Aviptadil, a synthetic form of Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP) has been awarded FDA Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of ARDS. Nonclinical studies demonstrate that VIP is highly concentrated in the lung, where it prevents NMDA-induced caspase-3 activation in the lung, inhibits IL6 and TNFa production, protects against HCl-induced pulmonary edema, These and other effects have been observed in numerous animal model systems of lung injury in mice, rats, guinea pigs, sheep, swine, and dogs. In these models, Aviptadil restores barrier function at the endothelial/alveolar interface and thereby protects the lung and other organs from failure. Aviptadil is approved for human use in Europe and has a demonstrated 20 year history of safety in numerous trials for Sarcoid, Pulmonary Fibrosis, Bronchospasm, Erectile Dysfunction, and a phase I trial in ARDS. Five phase 2 trials have been conducted under European regulatory authority. Numerous healthy volunteer studies have shown that i.v. infusion of Aviptadil is well tolerated with few adverse effects including alterations in blood pressure, heart rate, or ECG. In addition to published studies of human use, Aviptadil has been used on a compounded basis in certain ICUs for many years in the belief that it preserves life and restores function in pulmonary hypertension, ARDS, and Acute Lung Injury (ALI). In this study, patients who are hospitalized and intubated for ARDS secondary to COVID-19 infection will be randomly allocated to Aviptadil administered by intravenous infusion, nebulization via the endotracheal tube, and both IV and endotracheal administration. Primary endpoints will be improvement in blood oxygenation and mortality.;"Acute Lung Injury, which triggers Critical COVID-19 is a known lethal complication of Corona Virus (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Conventional medical therapy, including intensive care and respiratory support is associated with an 80% mortality. Aviptadil, a synthetic form of Human Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP) has been awarded FDA Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of ARDS and admitted to the FDA CoronaVirus Technology Accelerator Program.

VIP binds to VPAC1 receptors on the pulmonary Alveolar Type II (ATII) cell. ATII cells comprise only 5% of lung epithelial cells but are critical for oxygen transfer, surfactant production, and maintenance of Alveolar Type 1 cells. 70% of VIP binds to this receptor. The Type II cell is also the cell selectively attacked by the SARS-CoV-2 virus via the ACE2 surface receptor.

Nonclinical studies demonstrate that VIP is highly concentrated in the lung and specifically bound to the ATII cell, where it prevents NMDA-induced caspase-3 activation in the lung, inhibits IL6 and TNFa production, protects against HCl-induced pulmonary edema, and upregulates surfactant production, These and other effects have been observed in numerous animal model systems of lung injury in mice, rats, guinea pigs, sheep, swine, and dogs. In these models, Aviptadil restores barrier function at the endothelial/alveolar interface and thereby protects the lung and other organs from failure.

Aviptadil ihas a demonstrated 20 year history of safety in phase 2 trials for Sarcoid, Pulmonary Fibrosis, Bronchospasm, and a phase I trial in ARDS. In that phase I trial, 8 patients with severe ARDS on mechanical ventilation were treated with ascending doses of VIP. Seven of the 8 patients were successfully extubated and were alive at the five day timepoint. Six left the hospital and one died of an unrelated cardiac event.

Five phase 2 trials of aviptadil have been conducted under European regulatory authority. Numerous healthy volunteer studies have shown that i.v. infusion of Aviptadil is well tolerated with few adverse effects including alterations in blood pressure, heart rate, or ECG. In addition to published studies of human use, Aviptadil has been used on a compounded basis in certain ICUs for many years in the belief that it preserves life and restores function in pulmonary hypertension, ARDS, and Acute Lung Injury (ALI).

In this study, patients who are hospitalized for Critical COVID-19 infection with respiratory failure will be randomly allocated to Aviptadil administered by intravenous infusion in addition to maximal intensive care vs. maximal intensive care alone. Primary endpoints will be improvement in blood oxygenation and mortality."

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04315948;detailed_description;This study is a multi-centre, adaptive, randomized, open clinical trial of the safety and efficacy of treatments of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults. The study is a multi-centre/country trial that will be conducted in up to 50 sites globally with multiple sponsors. Adults (≥18 year-old) hospitalized for COVID- 19 with SpO2 ≤ 94% on room air OR acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and/or supplemental oxygen will be randomized between 4 treatment arms, each to be given in addition to the usual standard of care (SoC) in the participating hospital: SoC alone versus SoC + Remdesivir versus SoC + Lopinavir/Ritonavir versus SoC + Lopinavir/Ritonavir plus interferon ß-1a. Randomization will be stratified by site and severity of illness at enrollment (moderate disease: patients NOT requiring non-invasive ventilation NOR high flow oxygen devices NOR invasive mechanical ventilation NOR ECMO and severe disease: patients requiring non-invasive ventilation OR high flow oxygen devices OR invasive mechanical ventilation OR ECMO). The interim trial results will be monitored by a Data Monitoring Committee, and if at any stage evidence emerges that any one treatment arm is definitely inferior then it will be centrally decided that that arm will be discontinued. Conversely, if good evidence emerges while the trial is continuing that some other treatment(s) should also be being evaluated then it will be centrally decided that one or more extra arms will be added while the trial is in progress. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of different investigational therapeutics relative to the control arm in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the primary endpoint is subject clinical status (on a 7-point ordinal scale) at day 15. The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate 1) the clinical efficacy of different investigational therapeutics through 28 days of follow-up as compared to the control arm as assessed by clinical severity (7-point ordinal scale, national early warning score, oxygenation, mechanical ventilation), hospitalization, mortality through 28 days of follow-up 2) the safety of different investigational therapeutics through 28 days of follow-up as compared to the control arm as assessed by the cumulative incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs), the cumulative incidence of Grade 3 and 4 adverse events (AEs), the discontinuation or temporary suspension of antiviral drugs (for any reason), and the changes in blood white cell count, haemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, prothrombine time and international normalized ratio (INR), glucose, total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) over time.;This study is a multi-centre, adaptive, randomized, open clinical trial of the safety and efficacy of treatments of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults.

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04312009;primary_outcome_description;The SOFA assessment is used to track a person's risk status during stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The score is based on six different scores, one each for the respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation, renal, and neurological systems. Each organ system is assigned a point value from 0 (normal) to 4 (high degree of dysfunction/failure). Outcome is reported as only the respiratory component score. Respiratory scores range from 0-4, with higher scores indicating greater chance of mortality due to respiratory failure.;Outcome calculated from the partial pressure of oxygen or peripheral saturation of oxygen by pulse oximetry divided by the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2 or SaO2 : FiO2 ratio). PaO2 is preferentially used if available. A correction is applied for endotracheal intubation and/or positive end-expiratory pressure. Patients discharged prior to day 7 will have a home pulse oximeter send home for measurement of the day 7 value, and will be adjusted for home O2 use, if applicable. Patients who died will be applied a penalty with a P/F ratio of 0.

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04374786;detailed_description;"The COVID-19 global pandemic is significantly impacting healthcare providers and presumably affecting their stress level as they deal with this time of uncertainty. The COVID-19 public health crisis requires the full resources and attention of healthcare systems. This has led to several healthcare changes that affect physicians in training, including changes to rotations and schedules, risks of infection exposure to themselves or their families, and the unknown impacts this may have on their residency and fellowship experiences.

These changes are likely impacting their stress, health, and well-being. Physician burnout is major concern for the medical community and likely to be further impacted by the current pandemic. Evidence-based interventions for stress include cognitive behavior therapy, although this can be time consuming, requires the need for specialized providers, and is not feasible for everyone during this COVID-19 pandemic. Pharmacotherapy can be used, including antidepressants and anxiolytics, however they have inherent limitations such as side effects, tolerance, and interactions that limit their use. Consumer based mobile applications (apps) may help individuals with self-management strategies for stress (1). Mindfulness meditation is one type of self-management strategy and is the practice of moment-to-moment awareness in which the person purposefully focuses on the present without judgement (1,2).

""Calm"" is a mobile app that offers a range of meditation lessons, sleep stories (bed-time stories for grown-ups), sleep music, and nature sounds with modules that vary in length, instruction, and content. Few studies on the use of ""Calm"" exist and include a randomized controlled trial evaluating its affect to decrease stress among college students and a descriptive study evaluating cancer patient's perceptions of the app (1,3). There is evidence to support the use of similar apps in resident physicians. A pilot study assessing the effects of a meditation app on resident wellness suggested both the feasibility and efficacy of such an intervention (4). During these unprecedented times of the COVID-19 pandemic, mobile apps such as Calm may be potentially beneficial to help with stress in house staff physicians, although this requires further investigation.";"The COVID-19 global pandemic is significantly impacting healthcare providers and presumably affecting their stress level as they deal with this time of uncertainty.

Once approved, the patient will then be vaccinated with both the seronegative and quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines. Subsequently, antibiotic coverage against Nessieria Meningitis will be initiated and stopped no sooner than 2 weeks after the vaccinations were administered. The entire vaccination protocol should be completed. Soliris will be administered in the following manner: 900mg IV every 7 days for 4 weeks THEN 1200mg IV on the 5th week THEN 1200mg IV every 14 days ongoing until at least one month after the patient has recovered from the virus. Administration of Soliris as early as possible after diagnosis to prevent compliment mediated mortality & injury is ideal. Supportive care will continue during the administration of soliris Once recovered the patient's blood will be collected and sent for possible recovery of an antibody with the hopes that it may aid in the creation of a vaccine against Covid-19. Follow up at day 7, 14, and 28 after discharge.;"Recorded Endpoints:

Mortality
Time in the ICU
Time on a ventilator

Administrative:

An Emergency FDA IND must be submitted (FDA form 3926) for each patient.

Subsequent to approval the primary investigator will obtain an authorization letter from Alexion Pharmaceuticals.

Implementation:

Prior to dosing the patient must receive ceftriaxone IV and this must be continued during the entire duration of therapy (vaccination will be mentioned shortly and is the only exception to prophylactic antibiotic coverage). If there is a clinical reason why the patient cannot receive Ceftriaxone (allergy, supply, etc) then an alternative prophylactic antibiotic covering Neisseria meningitis must be given for the duration of therapy. The SeroB and Quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines can be given if the duration of antibiotic therapy becomes unsafe or unfeasible. In that case, antibiotic therapy should be withdrawn no sooner than 2 weeks after vaccination with both meningococcal vaccines (see ACIP guidelines in complement deficient patients). It is preferred that vaccination is avoided while the patient is acutely ill and that prophylactic antibiotics are used as meningococcal vaccination can upregulate the immune system possibly worsening the patient's condition.

Standard dosing protocol - Eculizumab 900mg IV every 7 days. Eculizumab is given IV over 30 minutes without the need of a pump (although one can be used if available).

Supplemental doses of eculizumab can be given if clinically warranted at the discretion of the investigator and clinical team.

The team should perform Murray scores daily for the first 72 hours THEN every other day unless a change is deemed necessary by the attending physician. (table 2)

Complement blood levels should be drawn every 72 hours. They may be drawn sooner if there is clinical inquiry which would affect clinical decision making and/or after a dose of Eculizumab is given.

The duration of therapy is at the discretion of the clinical team and investigator.

Follow up at day 7, 14, and 28 after discharge."

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04373096;detailed_description;"Hospital acquired infection and death of healthcare workers is an alarming problem during the COVID-19 pandemic. Avoiding transmission of COVID-19 to front-line health care workers in Ontario with optimal Protective Personal Equipment (PPE) is a public health priority to prevent attrition of the health care work force at a time when it is most needed to care for the needs of Ontarians.

Health care workers performing Aerosol Generating Medical Procedures (AGMPs) (e.g. endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy and tracheostomies) are at particularly high risk of infection. 1During AGMPs, medical personnel are contaminated with virus-loaded micro-droplets3 that may be suspended in the air for up to 3 hours.4

Use of effective PPE is paramount in protecting health care workers during these high-risk procedures. Limited world-wide supplies of PPE and disruption of supply chains is a current concern. Having local sources of PPE production could help secure supply and protect Ontario's health care work force.

Current standard PPE equipment used during high-risk procedures in Ontario includes a fit-tested N95 mask, an open face shield, a procedure gown and double extended-cuff gloves. This level of PPE leaves certain areas of the head and neck exposed to contamination with viral aerosol and droplets, and could be a source for self-contamination despite meticulous donning and doffing. In fact, extensive contamination of the front surfaces, the neck, forearms, wrists and hands has been previously identified during simulation of medical procedures.5 Contamination of the upper body, especially the head and neck, hands and wrists poses the highest risk of potential infection as viral contaminants in these parts of the body are most likely to reach the mucosal surfaces of the mouth, nose and eyes, which are the recognized entry points of viral infection.

We propose to design and test a protective hood to be used in place of the open shield to provide enhanced coverage of the upper body during high risk procedures. This hood would be used along an N95 mask, procedure gown and double extended-cuff gloves, allowing for effective barrier protection against SARS-CoV-2 rich droplets and microdroplets by providing the physician with a barrier that covers his/her upper torso from contamination.

In partnership with 2 Ontario companies (MVF & Associates and Piedmont Plastics) we have designed a hood to cover the entire upper body from the head down to the elbows. The hood is made of polypropylene spunbond nonwoven fabric, a waterproof, air permeable material and a polycarbonate visor.

The use of a hood could positively impact the safety of airway management and other AGMPs during the pandemic by reducing contamination of the upper body. The proposed study is important because it is the first one to evaluate the potential impact of a hood to enhance PPE. Ultimately, decreased levels of contamination by droplets may effectively reduce the risk of health care worker infection by SARS CoV2 virus after an AGMP such as endotracheal intubation.";"Hospital acquired infection and death of healthcare workers is an alarming problem during the COVID-19 pandemic.

To demonstrate that Colchicine in moderate/high-risk COVID patients:

Reduces the need for oxygen supplementation beyond 8L nasal cannula
Reduces the need for mechanical ventilation
Reduces max troponin elevations
Reduces inflammatory markers
Reduces length of hospitalization
Reduces mortality

HYPOTHESIS The investigators hypothesize that treatment with colchicine in COVID-19 moderate/high-risk patients may decrease the risk of progression into ARDS requiring increased oxygen requirements, mechanical ventilation, and mortality.

STUDY DESIGN Prospective, completely randomized, open labeled, controlled study. Patients will be randomized into two groups (A and B). Patients of group A will be treated under what is considered current standard of care at Maimonides Medical Center while group B patients will receive colchicine in addition to standard of care.

Treatment arm

In addition to the local standard of care for COVID 19 patients, the patient will receive colchicine PO as such:

Loading dose of 1.2 mg followed by 0.6mg after 2 hours if without significant gastrointestinal symptoms (day 1)
The next day 0.6mg bid for 14 days or until discharge

Patients who are on HMG-Co A Reductase Inhibitors (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin), fibrates, genfibrozil, amiodarone, dronedarone or digoxin should have the colchicine dosage reduced to a loading dose of 0.6mg followed by 0.3mg after two hours (day 1) followed by 0.3mg BID for 14 days or until discharge.

If patients have significant gastrointestinal symptoms after loading, the dosage may be reduced to 0.3mg BID for the rest of the 14 day course or until discharge. If gastrointestinal symptoms continue, the medication should then be discontinued. Patients who experience sensory motor neuropathy, or symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with rhabdomyolysis should prompt immediate discontinuation of the drug. If renal function deteriorates during the treatment course and CrCl <30ml/min, colchicine should also be discontinued.

Control arm Usual medical therapy (can include medications such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin)

Patients should NOT receive Steroids (IV/PO), Remdesivir, IL-6 inhibitors (Tociluzimab, Sarilumab), JAK inhibitors, IL-1 inhibitors, or other immunomodulators for COVID-19 after randomization while not intubated. Since the primary clinical endpoint is progression of disease, if the patient requires mechanical ventilation, the primary clinical endpoint is met and the above experimental salvage medications will be permitted. To rephrase, the patient will be allowed steroids, Remdesivir, IL-6 inhibitors and other immunomodulators only after intubation if deemed medically necessary by the treating physician.

Design: The pilot study is a prospective randomized study involving colchicine in the experimental arm. The study will be performed in the inpatient wards at Maimonides Medical Center.

Data Collection Procedures: Data will be collected from Sunrise Clinical Manager Electronic records at Maimonides Medical Center.

Patients with COVID-19 infection are usually assessed with laboratory tests to determine their inflammatory state. Markers such as CRP, troponin, LDH and Ferritin, and IL6 level are used routinely during the patient's hospitalization. These markers are also frequently repeated during the hospitalization to gauge a patient's clinical status. At the time of study randomization, a set of these markers will be obtained if not already obtained in the prior 24 hours. We recommend clinical follow up of these markers as medically indicated by the treating physician. We recommend ascertainment of a peak troponin elevation during the hospitalization and peak CRP as would be expected in standard medical care.

Biochemical end points

Maximum troponin elevation
Maximum CRP; Time (days) from colchicine initiation to achieve CRP <1

Clinical end points

PRIMARY:

○ Percentage of patients who require escalation of supplemental oxygen beyond low-flow nasal cannula (>8L/min)

SECONDARY:

Percentage of patients who will require mechanical ventilation
Hospital length of stay
Mortality

Safety Monitoring The investigators anticipate colchicine to have an excellent safety profile given the medication's widespread use in the outpatient and inpatient setting. However outcome data at each 20 patients will be evaluated to ensure there are no adverse events which would would necessitate pausing or discontinuation of the study. A signal for adverse events will be discussed internally with the investigators and reported to the IRB. Serious adverse events will be reported within 24 hours to the IRB.";"Prospective, completely randomized, open labeled, controlled study. Patients will be randomized into two groups (A and B).

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04363437;brief_summary;"COVID-19 infection is a respiratory infectious disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2 . This virus is transmitted from person to person through close contacts or respiratory droplets. Symptoms usually start 4 or 5 days after exposure. Some common symptoms include fever, dry cough, feeling tired, muscle aches, and trouble breathing. Although it may affect all organs in our body, it mainly attacks our lungs' ability to help us breathe.

There are currently no FDA approved medications to treat COVID-19 infection. Patients are given medications to help alleviate the symptoms. When patients are admitted to the hospital, they are given medications to reduce fever, relieve pain and supplement oxygen. In severe cases, patients are put on a ventilator, a machine designed to to support the lungs. There are a number of drugs undergoing clinical study to see if they are effective in treating the COVID-19 virus.

At Maimonides Medical Center, the investigators are taking the appropriate steps to find an effective treatment for COVID-19. The COMBAT COVID-19 Pilot Study is designed for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection who require oxygen supplementation to be treated with colchicine to reduce the chance of needing a mechanical ventilator.

Colchicine is an FDA approved medication that is used to treat inflammatory disorders such as Gout and Familial Mediterranean Fever. It has also been used to treat other inflammatory conditions such as inflammation around the heart and been demonstrated to help patients who have had an acute heart attack. Colchicine is a readily available drug which is usually well tolerated by patients. The investigators believe that colchicine may reduce the inflammation in the lungs. If so, the lungs may be able heal at a quicker pace and we hope that this may reduce the need for mechanical ventilation.

The research will be a randomized trial, patient will be randomly selected to be in either the colchicine treatment group or the standard medicines group. The treatment group will receive colchicine for 14 days or until the day of discharge. The standard medicines group will receive the usual medical therapy as determined by attending physician.";"The most prevalent complication of COVID-19 infection is respiratory failure from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the leading cause of mortality. There is increasing indication that the decompensation in severe COVD-19 infection may be due to a cytokine storm syndrome. This hyperinflammatory syndrome results in a fulminant and fatal hypercytokinemia and multiorgan failure.

Approximately 15% of patients with COVID-19 infection are hospitalized and 20-30% of these hospitalized patients require ICU care and/or mechanical ventilation. Overall mortality in hospitalized patients is approximately 20-25%. There is significant interest in therapies that can be given upstream to reduce the rate of mechanical ventilation and thus mortality.

We hypothesize that treatment with colchicine in COVID-19 moderate-severe patients may decrease the risk of progression into ARDS requiring increased oxygen requirements, mechanical ventilation, and mortality."

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04251871;detailed_description;In December 2019, a cluster of patients with pneumonia in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, which named the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). It was frequently reported that 2019-nCoV could be a public health crisis with high infectiousness, and it naturally spread across the country. Most of patients with 2019-nCoV infection were found to have non-specific symptoms including fever, cough, myalgia and fatigue. In addition, some patients were more likely to develop severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), or even die. However, there was no timely and effective treatment of patients with 2019-nCoV infection. Traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs), are derived from plants and usually incorporate one or more herbs as the basic drug(s) to treat the disease. An RCT was performed to investigate TCM was effective and safe for treating 2019-nCoV infection. Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio, and 1 subject on conventional medicines and TCMs granules for every 1 subject on conventional medicines. According to recommendations for prevention and control of pneumonia cause by 2019-nCoV infection from China National Health Commission, conventional medicines involve oxygen therapy and antiviral therapy (alfa interferon via aerosol inhalation, and lopinavir/ritonavir, p.o). Additionally, planned interim analysis will be performed, because the prevention and control of 2019-nCoV infection might affect estimated enrollment.;In December 2019, a cluster of patients with pneumonia in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, which named the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19).

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04373135;detailed_description;"Background: COVID-19 has led to significant disruptions to usual operations of the health care system and routines of millions of people. Regular medical appointments have been preempted or converted to telemedicine, dietary changes have occurred due to food supply chain strain, and exercise regimens altered by physical distancing policies, all of which may affect preventive care and chronic illness management [1]. Additionally, anxiety about risk of developing COVID-19 and the availability of health care resources may alter care-seeking behaviors even for serious conditions, e.g., heart attacks [2]. Understanding personal health and protective behaviors under threat of COVID-19 is an epidemiologic imperative and can inform immediate public health response as well as planning for population health needs post-crisis.

Critical care capacity during COVID-19 is also a matter of extreme concern [3]. Limitations in capacity, particularly mechanical ventilators [4, 5] have necessitated scarce resource allocation (SRA) policies, which outline triage protocols while observing ethical principles of distributive justice, transparency, and equitability [4, 6]. In practice, these policies determine which patients are most likely to benefit from intensive care, and some patients with a significantly heightened risk for mortality [7-9] are less likely to be prioritized in critical care allocation decisions. The uncertainty around prioritization and threat of rationing of care has generated public attention and anxiety evident in medical journals [6, 10], news outlets [11], and on social media [12, 13].

The rapidity of this crisis has compelled rapid development and/or modification of SRA policies without the rigorous stakeholder engagement or evaluations of acceptance of these policies by both laypersons and practitioners tasked with implementing such policies [14-16]. Two states (CA & NY), among the most affected by COVID-19, have recently developed new SRA policies, creating a unique opportunity to evaluate how these policies are understood and perceived by the patients most likely to be impacted by them and the practitioners who will implement them. Moreover, given the complexity of the ethical underpinnings and potential misinformation about SRA policies, there is a clear need to determine if a brief educational intervention can influence perception and knowledge about these containment and management policies.

We propose to undertake rapid recruitment of a national cohort of individuals and health care workers to understand knowledge and perceptions of public health and clinical efforts during this evolving pandemic; and to implement a randomized controlled trial within this cohort to test the ability of a brief intervention to improve knowledge and perceptions about the health care system's capacity to provide equitable care during a pandemic. Our specific aims are to:

Aim 1: Determine how key indicators of population health (including health status, health behaviors, and access to care) have changed during the COVID-19 outbreak in the US.
Aim 1a: Uncover the extent of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in the impacts of COVID-19 on health, health behaviors, and access to care.
Aim 2: Assess the public's and practitioners' knowledge and values around SRA policies and examine which individual characteristics correlate with these knowledge and values.
Aim 3: Evaluate the impact of a brief educational intervention on knowledge and values for SRA policy among the public and health care workers.

Population & Recruitment: For Aim 1, we will employ national outreach strategies [17-19] via social media and partnerships with national organizations (e.g., TCOYD) to recruit a sample of adults (ages 18 and older) from the general population. We will enrich this sample by direct recruitment efforts (via online health portal invitation) of over 300,000 patients in the Southern California Area who are cared for in the University of California at Los Angeles Health System (UCLA Health). For Aim 2, we will employ similar national outreach strategies involving professional language targeted posts on social media sites (e.g., Doximity, LinkedIn) to recruit a sample of health care providers. Additionally, this cohort will be enriched by direct recruitment efforts of health workers employed by UCLA. Cohort participants in Aims 1 & 2 from California and New York (residence determined based on ZIP code) will be randomized for Aim 3 to receive either a brief educational video or no intervention. All participants (Aims 1-3) will be invited to complete three surveys (baseline, one-month post-intervention follow-up, and four-month follow-up; Figure 1). Sample recruitment path and representativeness with be assessed using unique source links and standard visitor tracking analytics built into the study website.

Survey Assessments: Participants will first be presented with an online consent form that includes language typical of a written consent and upon affirming consent will be directed to complete the baseline survey. The patient baseline survey will collect sociodemographic information (including ZIP code), chronic conditions and current health status, health behaviors, anxiety and stress levels, changes to health and care seeking behaviors (e.g., social distancing, medication adherence, care-seeking behaviors), and will include series of questions assessing perceptions and attitudes and knowledge about SRA policies and how they are implemented (e.g., values about how decisions are made, understanding of prioritization versus exclusion from critical care). Demographic, behavioral, and access questions are largely derived from the validated Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System questionnaires [20] which will provide a historical comparison for study results. For providers, additional questions about the characteristics of the provider will include specialty, years of practice, and trainee status. Follow-up surveys will re-administer key baseline questions on SRA knowledge and values, personal health behaviors, and COVID-19-specific impacts (e.g., if they or a loved one was hospitalized and/or was subject to an SRA policy decision, and for providers, whether they had to use an SRA tool during their practice); follow-up surveys will additional ascertain exposure to media coverage about COVID-19 and SRAs in the intervening windows. All surveys will be administered via Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system and links to complete follow-up surveys will be automatically delivered to participants via e-mail, with up to four reminders to complete, facilitating linkage between survey administration within individuals. E-mails will be stored separately from survey data in REDCap and will be permanently deleted upon study completion.

Intervention and Randomization: We will develop a brief (~3 min) video intervention that describes what SRA policies are, how they were developed, who is most likely to be impacted, and patients' rights under these policies. Two versions will be utilized, one oriented for a lay audience and one for practitioners using technical medical language, but both will be relevant to the policies currently in place in two of the hardest hit states (NY and CA). The investigators have contracted with WorldWise Productions, who have completed similar videos for multiple other UCLA Health and DGSOM projects. The intervention will be hosted on a private YouTube channel and embedded in REDCap so that it can be automatically delivered as part of the survey. We will execute a stratified randomization scheme based on state, age, and education level to allocate respondents from CA and NY evenly between intervention and control. Participants outside CA & NY will serve as negative controls. All participants will receive a post-intervention survey with repeat assessment (as described above).

Focus Groups: Because COVID-19 is a rapidly evolving crisis and there are no pre-existing validated questions to ascertain COVID-19 perceptions and impacts, we plan to conduct a final qualitative follow-up (post-crisis) with a geographically and sociodemographically diverse selection of participants (both patients and providers) in order to obtain a more nuanced and complete examination of perceptions, attitudes, and experiences. Participants selected will be invited to participate approximately 4-6 months later (after the COVID-19 crisis has slowed). Key health behavior themes will include experience with telemedicine, disruptions to health care access, and general changes to health during and after COVID-19 pandemic; particular attention will be paid to inequities in these outcomes. Key SRA themes will include the method of selecting patients, concerns about equity, special considerations for disadvantaged or vulnerable populations, and perceptions of the crisis response in general. Groups will be conducted via web-conference using Zoom and recorded, transcribed, and then qualitative methods used to analyze transcripts for key themes. We plan to conduct approximately 15 focus groups of 5-10 participants each.

Power: To detect a ½ standard deviation change in the number of correct knowledge items between the intervention and control arms with 90% power and a two-sided α=0.05, 172 total participants are needed to complete follow-up. Based on our prior work [18, 19] with >80% trial retention and recruitment of 55 participants per day, we anticipate recruiting the necessary 216 baseline trial participants within 4 days. We anticipate that we will substantially exceed our targets to achieve desired trial power.

Milestones & Actionable Outcomes: There is a paucity of evidence on changes in health status and behaviors related to physical distancing policies and the widescale adoption and implementation of SRA policies. By determining how health behaviors and access to care are impacted at baseline, we can directly issue recommendations for patients and providers aimed at affecting population health and mitigating disparities therein. Our assessment of SRA policies and how they are perceived and implemented during a crisis will dramatically increase our ability to design and apply such policies in a fair and equitable way and to determine what adjustments to the policies from a clinical perspective are needed to ensure that disproportionate burden is not borne by vulnerable patients. As the baseline survey has already been developed, piloted, and programmed into REDCap and we have established partnerships with several organizations who have already agreed to assist with study recruitment - we are prepared to initiate the study immediately. Production on the intervention video can begin as soon as notice of funds have been received. Trial milestones include recruitment of >216 participants from CA & NY within the first week of recruitment and retention of >172 participants at one-month follow-up. Additional milestones include the submission of several research papers to high-impact medical journals detailing research findings.";"Background:

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04344184;detailed_description;"In December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases was reported in Wuhan, China, and a novel coronavirus, SARS-Cov-2, was identified. The World Health Organization (WHO) designated the respiratory disease as coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on February 12, 2020. Numerous reports have since characterized the COVID-19 clinical syndrome, ranging from asymptomatic/mild disease to severe disease leading to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation (i.e., ARDS, multi-organ failure, sepsis, and death).

A safe, effective, and inexpensive therapy is urgently needed, one that can alter the natural course of the disease process and reduce strain on healthcare systems. High Dose Intravenous Vitamin C is a safe and possibly effective treatment for ARDS and has been described to be effective for ARDS of viral origin.

A double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized control trial from our institution involving 167 patients with ARDS who were randomized to receive 50 mg/kg every 6 hours of HDIVC for 4 days versus placebo showed a statistically significant difference in 28-day all-cause mortality. The 28-day mortality was 29.8% in the vitamin C group versus 46.3% in the placebo group, although this was a secondary outcome.

This can be translated as a Number Needed to Treat (NNT) of 6-8 patients to save one life from ARDS. The statistical effect on mortality remained up to 60-days following trial completion.

We, therefore, cannot withhold the treatment from patients with ARDS. It remains unknown if HDIVC given early can prevent the progression to ARDS and if it is effective in COVID-19 ARDS.

The first study, published in 1986, treated 16 ARDS patients with intravenous vitamin C (1000 mg IV every 6 hours) plus antioxidants versus 16 ARDS patients who received the standard care at that time (i.e., control group). There was a reduction in mortality in the vitamin C group: 37% versus 71% in the standard care group (p<0.01). A phase I trial in 2014 proved that plasma vitamin C in patients with severe sepsis and ARDS were low, almost at scorbutic levels and that HDIVC administration had a dose-dependent effect in the prevention of multi-organ failure, as measured by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores.

Patients who received a total of 200 mg/kg/day of HDIVC for 4 days (administered in 50 mg/kg/dose, every 6 hours), had significantly lower organ failure scores than placebo, and even lower scores than the patients who received lower-doses of IV vitamin C (50 mg/kg/day administered at 12.5 mg/kg/dose, every 6 hours for 4 days). In this trial, the patients in the HDIVC group (200 mg/kg/day) achieved plasma levels up to 3,000 µM on day 4.

To assess the treatment effect of a 72-hour intravenous vitamin C infusion protocol (100 mg/kg every 8 hours) in patients with hypoxemia and suspected COVID-19 (Novel Coronavirus ID-19). In the course of performing this phase 2 trial we will explore three following hypotheses:

Primary Endpoint: HDIVC infusion will increase 28-day ventilator-free days. Secondary Endpoint A: HDIVC infusion will reduce 28-day all-cause hospital mortality.

Secondary Endpoint B: HDIVC infusion will significantly increase acute inflammation-free days (defined as CRP >=10 mg/L) among COVID-19 patients.

Secondary Endpoint C: HDIVC infusion will be safe, as demonstrated by organ-failure-free days up to 28 days.";"In December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases was reported in Wuhan, China, and a novel coronavirus, SARS-Cov-2, was identified.

Background Information

SARS-COV-2 is a novel human pathogen that emerged at the end of 2019 and rapidly spread worldwide. Clinical disease caused by this novel infection has a high mortality rate, particularly in older adults and in patients with underlying cardiopulmonary disease, populations that are highly prevalent within the VA healthcare system. This creates an urgent need for the VA to quickly and efficiently identify effective therapies to reduce mortality and spread of the disease. Based on in vitro and in vivo data, potential treatment options include anti-viral drugs (such as antimalarials or medications originally developed to treat HIV infection (e.g., lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir)), anti-inflammatory drugs, including IL-6 inhibition, and innovations in supportive care, such as placing patients in prone positioning while awake and not intubated. Importantly, in the context of the global pandemic and exponential spread of the disease, clinical trials must be designed in a manner that 1) optimizes outcomes for Veterans, and 2) produces rapid answers, so that effective treatments can be deployed quickly to reduce unnecessary deaths. Based on a review of 384 ongoing clinical trials by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, and a daily search of open clinical trials, many conventional controlled clinical trials of antiviral drugs and cytokine-blocking drugs are in progress and are likely to be completed within a few months; however, it is possible that these trials, which may take months to implement and report results, will not yield any information about how to treat patients until after the peak of the pandemic is over. A secondary challenge is that it is important to identify what works and what does not work quickly, so that manufacturers can understand what medications need to be produced so that supply chains are adequate for treating all patients who might benefit from an intervention. Thus, innovative clinical trial methodologies are needed in order to produce answers in a highly compressed time frame to inform medical decision-making and supply chain management.

This novel and innovative proposal concerns use and comparison an existing drug (sarilumab) that blocks the receptor for the inflammatory cytokine IL-6. Most studies of IL-6 pathway blockade are using IV medications and include restrictive eligibility criteria and are directed towards patients with severe disease. We hypothesize that patients earlier in the disease course - prior to severe respiratory decompensation - might benefit the most from IL-6 inhibition, and thus are the population included in this pragmatic trial. This study will expand our knowledge and understanding about how IL-6 inhibition can be used to prevent disease progression in patients with moderate disease. It will use a more readily available subcutaneous, longer-acting formulation directed towards patients with moderate disease, of whom 25-35% can progress to severe disease, often rapidly. Eligibility criteria allow for a broad range of underlying choices of other medications, including antiviral medications such as remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine, among others, baseline laboratory values, and comorbidities, reflecting likely real-world clinical use. Thus, this pragmatic project would fill a major gap in research about the clinical care of patients with COVID-19.

Rationale and Purpose

Severe COVID-19 disease is characterized by a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) followed by a severe cardiomyopathy in many cases. Based on currently available data, it is unclear how much of the respiratory damage in COVID-19 is due to direct effects of SARS-COV-2, or if the primary driver of severe disease is the inflammatory response generated in response to the virus. The key role of inflammation in the progression of the disease is highlighted by recent studies, which demonstrate that patients who progress to requiring ICU-level care no longer have detectable virus present in their respiratory tract. Thus, identifying drugs that could dampen the inflammatory response prior to severe clinical decompensation without adversely affecting clearance of virus would be clinically useful and lead to improved outcomes. Elevated biomarkers of severe inflammation (such as IL-6, CRP, ferritin, and lymphopenia) have been strongly associated with severe disease and increased mortality in patients with COVID-19 [2,3], and early development of a strong IgG response may paradoxically be a poor prognostic sign during the acute phase of the disease. In contrast, viral load in upper respiratory secretions at baseline is only modestly associated with clinical outcomes, and viral load declines in most patients after presentation, independent of the clinical course of the disease [4]. Severe disease typically arises more than 2 weeks after symptom onset, a time at which virus is usually no longer detectable. These findings suggest that progression to severe disease may be driven more by the inflammatory response to the disease than a direct viral effect, and point to anti-inflammatory drugs as potentially critical therapeutic options. Importantly, high dose glucocorticoids have been found to be ineffective in severe COVID-19 and are associated with somewhat worse outcomes, so other more targeted anti-inflammatory options are urgently needed.

Blockade of IL-6 signaling is a particularly attractive approach. Sarilumab and tocililzumab are antibodies to the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), FDA-approved for long-term treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Tocilizumab has been used open-label with enough anecdotal success in enough patients in China [5] that the manufacturers of sarilumab and tocilizumab have rapidly opened clinical trials in multiple countries at assess efficacy in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. Tocilizumab has also demonstrated efficacy in reducing mortality associated with the cytokine release syndrome in patients receiving CAR-T treatment for cancer, in which the pathogenic pathway is widespread T-cell activation, which leads to production of pleiotropic inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 by monocytes. Although trials attempting to rescue patients with severe COVID-19 with ARDS and/or cardiomyopathy are essential and are in progress, the ideal population for clinical use may be patients who are not yet critically ill but are at high risk of clinical deterioration due to secondary inflammation.

Relevance to Veterans Health

COVID-19 has a high mortality rate of 2-3% among symptomatic patients. It is expected to have a particularly high mortality in Veterans, because age >60, underlying cardiovascular or lung disease, and obesity are significant risk factors for mortality and clinical deterioration. Thus, advances in care of patients sick enough to be hospitalized yet prior to ICU admission are expected to have particular benefit for Veterans.

Study Design

Design. Prospective, randomized, unblinded interventional clinical trial.

Two arms: standard care, based on established practices within the medical center, or standard care plus subcutaneous sarilumab.

Assignment Strategy: Randomized play-the-winner design, such that randomization becomes weighted toward the arm that was more effective in previous enrolled subjects. The probability of randomization to a specific arm (standard of care or standard of care plus intervention) will be updated based on outcomes in blocks of 10-20 subjects (see Planned Statistical Analyses). There is an option for open-label use of sarilumab in the standard-care group in the event the primary outcome (intubation) is met. Such patients may also receive any other treatment per the judgment of their treating physician.

Data will be extracted remotely from the EHR. No data will be generated specifically for study purposes.";"Aims/Objectives

The effectiveness of blockade of IL-6R in treating patients with COVID-19 disease of moderate severity will be tested in a pragmatic and adaptive randomized trial. The primary outcome is intubation or death within 14 days of enrollment OR administration of a rescue dose of IL-6 inhibition if the patient is do-not-resuscitate (DNR)/do-not-intubate (DNI) and the primary team determines it is appropriate based on clinical deterioration. Secondary outcomes include time to hospital discharge if alive, time to clinical recovery as was defined in a recent study, ICU length of stay, time to return to normal or baseline oxygen saturation, and changes in laboratory biomarkers.

Background Information

SARS-COV-2 is a novel human pathogen that emerged at the end of 2019 and rapidly spread worldwide. Clinical disease caused by this novel infection has a high mortality rate, particularly in older adults and in patients with underlying cardiopulmonary disease, populations that are highly prevalent within the VA healthcare system. This creates an urgent need for the VA to quickly and efficiently identify effective therapies to reduce mortality and spread of the disease. Based on in vitro and in vivo data, potential treatment options include anti-viral drugs (such as antimalarials or medications originally developed to treat HIV infection (e.g., lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir)), anti-inflammatory drugs, including IL-6 inhibition, and innovations in supportive care, such as placing patients in prone positioning while awake and not intubated.

Release of preliminary results to the popular press already necessitated revision of this protocol after only 9 subjects had been enrolled. Interim analysis of a study of sarilumab by its manufacturer has led to revision of the study population and treatment arms. Originally, two doses (200 mg and 400 mg) were tested, and patients with either severe (oxygen requirement and other poor prognostic features) or critical (mechanical ventilation) disease were included. Interim analysis indicated benefit only with 400 mg in critical disease, so that will be the design of the remainder of that trial. In contrast, a study of of a relatively high dose of tocilizumab (8 mg/kg) was reported to be beneficial in a controlled trial of patients varying in severity from critical illness to merely requiring supplementary oxygen. In response, the current study has been modified to allow routine escalation of dosing among a broad range of ""moderate"" severity short of critical illness. For patients who are critically ill, it is expected that off-label use of a wide range of ""heroic"" therapies will be tried, including but not limited to cytokine blocking therapies, so exclusion of such patients from this trial does not limit the therapeutic options for such patients, and from a research perspective, such patients have become the focus of the largest ongoing study of sarilumab.

Such patients may receive any treatment per the judgment of their treating physician, and such treatment might include sarilumab or tocilizumab. Use of sarilumab or tocilizumab in this setting will simply be regarded as a treatment failure and not as a protocol deviation.

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04373707;brief_summary;"Worldwide observational studies indicate a significant prothrombogenic effect associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection with a high incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), notably life-threatening pulmonary embolism.

According to recommendations for acute medical illnesses, all COVID-19 hospitalized patients should be given VTE prophylaxis such as a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). A standard prophylactic dose (eg. Enoxaparin 4000IU once daily) could be insufficient in obese patients and VTE has been reported in patients treated with a standard prophylactic dose.

In COVID-19 patients, guidelines from several international societies confirm the existence of an hypercoagulability and the importance of thromboprophylaxis but the ""optimal dose is unknown"" and comparactive studies are needed.

In view of these elements, carrying out a trial comparing various therapeutic strategies for the prevention of VTE in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 constitutes a health emergency.

Thus, we hypothesize that an increased prophylactic dose of weight-adjusted LMWH would be greater than a lower prophylactic dose of LMWH to reduce the risk of life-threatening VTE in hospitalized patients. The benefit-risk balance of this increase dose will be carefully evaluated because of bleeding complications favored by possible renal / hepatic dysfunctions, drug interactions or invasive procedures in COVID-19 patients.

This multicenter randomized (1:1) open-label controlled trial will randomize hospitalized adults with COVID-19 infection to weight-adjusted prophylactic dose vs. lower prophylactic dose of LMWH.";"Worldwide observational studies indicate a significant prothrombogenic effect associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection with a high incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), notably life-threatening pulmonary embolism.

Patients will interact with a virtual nurse daily on days 1-15 and every other day from days 16-30. If the patient's RAM measurements exceed predetermined thresholds, the patient reports specific symptoms (e.g., shortness of breath), a drug error is identified, or the virtual nurse has concerns about the patient's health that they cannot resolve, the virtual nurse will escalate care to a pre-assigned and available physician. Physicians will add or modify treatments as needed, and if required, they will have the patient come to an outpatient facility for evaluation or management. Via secure video or text messaging, patients will also have access to a virtual nurse at night, for any urgent issues.

clinicaltrials.gov;NCT04173663;intervention_model_description;Parallel Assignment;After eligibility is determined and baseline data are collected, parents will be randomized, in two cohorts, to the treatment or materials-only control condition. Given the relatively small sample size in each cohort at each site (n = 30 at each of three sites), simple randomization is not recommended as it might result in unequal group sizes. The investigators will use 1:1 block randomization within each site to give equal number of subjects in each group. To ensure balance of important covariates, the investigators will block on key moderators: whether the youth has an Intellectual Disability (ID) and is in high school. Co-occurring ID and being in vs. out of high school impact service eligibility, and ID impacts the likelihood of post-secondary education (PSE) and community employment. By balancing moderators, the researchers maximize power to detect effect modification of the treatment effect.

The CCT games will be designed to target focused attention, response inhibition, working memory and multiple simultaneous attention to constitute a general executive function training, and activate neural systems associated with executive function/cognitive control.

Access to CHES web portal will also be open to participants outside consultation time points, to enable them to monitor HRQoL if necessary. Workshop 1, will help patients to recognize and react to the occurrence of possible adverse effects, and anticipate their occurrence through appropriate preventive means. In workshop 2, participants will have the opportunity to express their representations and experiences related to their diet and the consequences of disease and treatments on diet. In workshop 3, participants can describe their experiences of fatigue and how their life is affected by it. Moreover, they can identify possible causes and finally discuss solutions to better this symptom. Every month, a reminder letter will also be sent to participants.
