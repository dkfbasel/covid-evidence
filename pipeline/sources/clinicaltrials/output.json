			"abstract": "Brief summary:\nThe aim of the study is to clinically use bovine Lf as a safe antiviral adjuvant for treatment and to assess the potential in reducing mortality and morbidity rates in COVID-19 patients. The study was approved by the ethical committee of the Egyptian Center for Research and Regenerative Medicine in 11-5-2020.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19) outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern with a pandemic spread. The situation is rapidly evolving, which raises the approach of reproposing already approved drugs to meet the emerging challenge and to save time and money. Lactoferrin (Lf) is a natural glycoprotein that broadly distributed within the body fluids and found predominantly in milk. It represents a known component of the innate immune system. The antiviral activity of Lf has been reported against many viruses, including SARS-CoV-1, through blocking the viral receptors on the host cells preventing them from entry and replication. Markedly, data reveals that Lf interacts with Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans (HSPGs) and Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors that are reported as SARS-CoV-2-binding sites to enter the host cell, suggesting a potential significance of Lf as an antiviral against SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the immunoregulatory effects of Lf can protect against the cytokine-storm and thrombotic complications that result from the COVID-19-induced over-stimulated inflammatory response and exaggerated immune reactions. In addition, Lf can decrease the free iron toxicity caused by the virus as it has a strong iron chelating ability. Lf is a safe approved food supplement that is available in the markets for enhancement of immunity and for treatment of anemia. The aim of this study is to perform a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two arms, clinical trial to assess oral enteric-coated tablet of bovine apolactoferrin (the low iron-content form of Lf) as a safe antiviral and immunoregulatory therapy in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 disease.",

			"abstract": "Brief summary:\nThe purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy of Aggrenox in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection with symptoms consistent with COVID-19. An anticipated total of 132 participants will be randomly divided almost equally into 2 groups: one group will receive Dipyridamole ER 200mg/ Aspirin 25mg orally/enterally along with the standard of care and the other group with receive the standard of care only but no Dipyridamole ER 200mg/ Aspirin 25mg. Participants will be screened, enrolled, receive treatment, and followed for 28 days. The clinical and laboratory outcomes of all the participants enrolled in the study will be evaluated at the end of the study to explore if there is any difference in the outcomes between 2 groups.\n\n\n\nDetailed descriptions:\nPurpose/Specific Aims: The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy of Aggrenox in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection with symptoms consistent with COVID-19.\n\nAmong 132 SARS-CoV-2 patients (66 patients in each randomized arm), we will determine the efficacy of Aggrenox on clinical outcomes.\n\nHypotheses / Research Question(s) Compared to standard care, the addition of Aggrenox (Dipyridamole ER 200mg/ Aspirin 25mg), to standard care will result in improvement in the composite COVID ordinal scale at day 15. Additionally, combined Aggrenox (Dipyridamole ER 200mg/ Aspirin 25mg orally/enterally), and standard care will reduce the need for ventilation, length of mechanical ventilation, hospital length of stay, ICU length of stay, decrease risk of thromboembolic complications and improve survival more than standard care alone in SARS-CoV-2 patients.\n\nResearch Design and Methods Randomized design. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to Aggrenox or standard treatment. Arm 1: Active Comparator: (Aggrenox (Dipyridamole ER 200mg/ Aspirin 25mg orally/enterally).\n\nParticipants will receive Aggrenox (Dipyridamole ER 200mg/ Aspirin 25mg orally/enterally), 2 times daily (FDA-recommended dose) starting on the day of enrollment for a total of 2 weeks + standard care.\n\nArm 2: Standard care Comparator: Participants will receive standard care starting on the day of enrollment for a total of 2 weeks.\n\nThe investigators will perform a randomized, 2-arm, open-label single-site pilot study to evaluate the effect of oral Aggrenox (Dipyridamole ER 200mg/ Aspirin 25mg orally/enterally), on clinical outcomes in patients with SARS-CoV-2. In this research proposal, investigators will randomly assign 132 consenting participants with diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 to two treatment groups: 1) Aggrenox (Dipyridamole ER 200mg/ Aspirin 25mg orally/enterally) + standard care and 2) standard care alone. Participants will be screened, enrolled, receive treatment and followed for 28 days. The study aim and procedure will be explained to every eligible subject and informed consent will be obtained from interested subjects or authorized proxy to participate in the study. The investigators will collect demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological data. The patients would be followed daily for 2 weeks after enrollment while the patient is in the hospital and once discharged, they will be called every 3rd day to follow up on the symptoms.",
