It has been adapted for use in COVID-19 patients by Italian engineers (see https://www.isinnova.it/easy-covid19-eng/)\u003cbr\u003eIn this trial we propose to apply the Decathlon mask in place of standard delivery systems for oxygen and positive airway pressure.  The Decathlon mask will be applied by clinicians in the hospital setting.\u003cbr\u003eThe mask is worn over the entire face and has advantages over conventional delivery methods in that it is thought to reduce the risk of virus aerosolization (a common problem with conventional delivery systems) and therefore increase safety for healthcare workers and other patients at the hospital.\u003cbr\u003eWe will test mask comfort and tolerability with daily questionnaires.\u003cbr\u003eThe mask will be applied to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients during transfer between the emergency department and other locations such as radiology department, ward and high dependency unit.\u003cbr\u003eWe anticipate the mask will be worn for several hours at a time depending on patient tolerability (early data from overseas suggests superior tolerability to conventional mask setups).  The mask may be used intermittently for the entire patient admission to hospital pending the clinical needs and preference of the patient. We anticipate, based on how conventional treatments are applied, that the patient will use the mask in 3 hour sessions with potential breaks in between to be determined by clinical need and patient tolerability.",

This signifies that an early pro-inflammatory reaction has been started in the lung. It is postulated that early anakinra treatment in these patients may halt this reaction and prevent development of SRF.  In the SAVE study patients with sars-cov-2 infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus at high risk for progression to MSDs will be detected using the suPAR biomarker. They will begin early treatment with anakinra in the effort to prevent progression in SAA. ",

This non-invasive device provides a physical barrier to droplet and aerosol spread, as well as utilising a ventilation system to reduce aerosol spread from COVID-19 or other infectious diseases.  The hood has a skirt that drapes down the sides of the bed and over the patients waist and does not seal around the patient. The hood relies upon air being drawn up the sides of the bed and from the front near the patient’s legs etc. up to the rear, i.e. away from the healthcare worker who is principally at the front/sides of the patient. The air passes through the fan and on through a High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter, thereafter returning to the hospital air environment.  The device will be used continuously for 7 days or until the patient has been declared COVID-19 negative, is discharged from hospital, or elects to withdraw from the study.  Use of the device is entirely voluntary, and patients may elect to cease use of the device at any time either temporarily, or permanently.  Staff will be asked to complete simple data for each clinical shift about device compliance use.  In addition, measures to capture technical product adverse events and complaints will be captured by forms available to clinical staff and checked daily by the investigator team.

The group will allow members to receive information and contribute to weekly conversations on pre-specified topics related to physical activity eg. sedentary behaviour, goal setting, benefits of physical activity and support. Different topics will be covered each week with 2-3 Facebook posts on the topic each week. The content of each topic is designed specifically for this study but will also make use of existing videos, pictures and information sources. An exercise physiologists and dietitian will deliver the program. The purpose of the Facebook group is to facilitate social support and provide participants with a platform to exchange personal experiences including barriers and facilitators to commencing and maintaining a physical activity program. While discussion topics will be pre-determined, discussion will change weekly based on the participants posts for example someone may ask for examples of workouts or different ways overcome barriers. Participants will also be able to join a group video call via zoom two times per week. These calls will last for 20-30mins. The facilitator will lead the call and provide education on the topic for the week. This will also give the facilitator the chance to check in on participants and allow them to ask questions. The intervention itself will go for 6 weeks however there is the option for participants to remain in the Facebook group and continue to use it for support without the input from the facilitators. All 20 participants will be included in the one Facebook group and encouraged to check the Facebook weekly. The page ",

The seven modules are: (1) identifying and rating emotions, (2) relaxation, (3) self-compassion, (4) gratitude, (5) staying connected, (6) physical care, and (7) goal setting. The app uses short videos and interactive activities to allow participants to practice the coping strategies that are taught in each module (e.g. a relaxation technique). Participants are asked to complete one module per day and to complete the modules in one week. Each module takes approximately 15 minutes to complete. Participants will be asked to complete module 1 first, but the other modules can be completed in any order. Adherence will be assessed via app analytics and also using self-report.",

Patients then enter the results into the TCC-COVID app twice daily, and complete a symptom questionnaire via the TCC-COVID app once daily, which will take approximately 5 minutes. The symptom questionnaire was designed specifically for this study. The measurements and information are directly connected to a clinician interface (KIOLA database) which provides the data of all patients in aggregate and an easy to use responsive format with customisable alerts. The alerts identify if the oxygen saturation levels are low or the pulse rate is out of range. The alerts also identify if a measurement has not been completed in a timely manner and the central monitoring service will contact the patient to check on their safety or if they are experiencing any technical issues. The overall duration of participation will be 14 days.",

The minimum SOFA score is 0 and the maximum is 24. In the event of death, the patient receives the maximum value of 24 points. Patients in the ambulant setting receive a value of 0. Patients in the stationaire setting who are not ventilated receive 0 points for the parameter \"Respiration\" (variable PaO2 / FiO2). Clinical trials have demonstrated that the maximum SOFA score correlates with mortality.\u003cbr\u003ePrimary endpoint 2 is the combination of a combination of intensive care admission, intubation and death.;Secondary Objective: Secondarily, the effect of discontinuation on clinical and laboratory parameters of SARS-CoV2 therapy is examined.;Main Objective: Patients with coronary artery disease, arterial hypertension or diabetes are often treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). Treatment with ACEI and ARB may be of great relevance for the course of COVID-19: Similar to SARS-CoV (epidemic 2002-2003), the novel SARS-CoV2 is also absorbed into human cells via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Treatment with ACEI and ARB leads to a significant upregulation of the SARS-CoV2 receptor ACE2. An increased expression of ACE2 in turn correlates with a higher intake of SARS-CoV2 and possibly promotes a faster spread of the virus in the organism of infected patients.\u003cbr\u003eThe primary aim of the study is to test whether discontinuing chronic ACEI or ARB therapy in patients with proven SARS-CoV2 infection leads to a more favorable course of the disease of COVID-19 than the continuation of the ACEI or ARB therapy.",

These herbs have previously had a single, double or triple human consumption history. Effectives per puff: 160 micrograms How to use PHR160: Determine the dosage approach for the above product based on the following: 1. Due to the volume of the nozzle output and pump MDIs and the presence of propylant (HFA gas) and alcohol in the product concentration of essential oils and herbal compounds in the total MDI is about 0.3%. Therefore, the total amount of soluble natural substances available per puff is less than 300 nL or 270 mg, which, of course, reaches a limited proportion in the lungs. 1-20 g / kg of human body weight and these compounds are considered very safe and high dosage is much lower than the toxic range indicated and is 1/100 toxic in the case of essential oils.3. Products available on the market such as Eucalyptus Barrage incense, Eucalyptus dyne incense Pulmonary doses of essential oils are similar to our product compounds in excess of 30mg. Of the amount in each puff investigated product is less than 1/100 of the amount above 0.4. External products mainly used in Aroma Therapy Ascents, MBC Aerosol, Primatene Mist are examples of those with higher doses of essential oil.5.Refruitment time to discuss the use or inhalation of the above product 30-45 In this case, the maximum time interval of 1 hour of awakening has been suggested for this product to",

			"intervention_name": "'Anchored' is a smartphone application-based intervention that includes therapeutic content centred on behavioural activation (BA), mindfulness, and cognitive behavioural tasks. It was adapted from HeadGear, an existing smartphone application designed for individuals working in male-dominated industries. Anchored is more broadly aimed at all adults, and has a more gender-neutral look and feel, achieved through use of colour scheme, imagery, font/typography, inclusion of male and female ‘characters’, and delivery of in-app content by both male and female presenters. The Anchored app is designed for self-directed use by an individual on a smartphone device. It features interactive content, delivered by on-screen text, audio, static and interactive image displays and videos. The app can be accessed by the participant on their smartphone at a time and location of their choosing. This app/intervention has been used previously in a pilot study: Pilot-testing of a mobile phone application to support the mental health of Australian workers (ACTRN12619000761167); and is being currently being evaluated in a large scale randomised controlled trial (ACTRN12620000178943). Due to the unexpected changes to the workforce brought about by COVID-19 (coronavirus) the present study seeks to evaluate the efficacy of the Anchored app in individuals who are unemployed as a consequence of COVID-19. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe main therapeutic component of the Anchored app takes the form of a 30 day intervention in which users complete one ‘challenge’ daily (5- 10 minutes per day).

In phase II non-randomized clinical trial, at first, 5 patients confirmed with COVID-19 and non-serious presentations are included in a pilot study from which informed consents have been gotten. The current standard treatments are given to the patients in an open-labeled approach and combinative drug including: two capsules and two spoonfuls of syrup per day including Niacin-Tannin in capsule and Apocynin in syrup with Bid consumption of Tannin(125mg) + Niacin(5mg) and one spoonful apocynin (2.5mg) up to 14 days. The control group only receives current treatment. . Then the side-effects and efficacies will be evaluated. If no side-effects are observed and therapeutic outcomes are positive, the results will be reported to the RCT assessment committee. If the permission is given, the trial will continue with more patients up to 20% of all experimental cases. Then the evaluation will be repeated. If the results are approved again, the study will continue on all the cases according to the following statement. In this clinical trial we will finally recruit 80 patients infected by COVID19 in two groups of experimental and control.

			"out_primary_measure": "Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF).  The evaluator will ask the patient to indicate their level of PEF assessed by Piko-1 device, twice each time. After obtaining values, patients will send them to the evaluator, by WhatsApp or email. We will calculate means of each 2 measurements, assessed by patients every day. ;Multidimensional Dysphnoea-12 (MD12) Spanish version. The MD12 questionnaire will be self-administered and will be performed at the end of the 6MWT. Patients will send the results of MD12 screenshot daily to the evaluator, via WhatsApp or email. ;Visual Analog Scale Fatigue (VASF), for fatigue measurement. Patients participating in the study will indicate the intensity of their fatigue by means of the VAS through the Smartphone application called “Visual Scale” (Apple Store and Google Play). They will have to signal in a horizontal line where they would place their fatigue, being 0 \"no fatigue\" and the 10 would be \"the worst imaginable fatigue”. VASF will be controlled telematically by the evaluators through the Smartphone application. The evaluator will ask the patient to indicate their level of VASF in the \"Visual Scale\" application, and to take a screenshot of the smartphone to obtain the established value for VASF, which is calculated as the average value of two attempts. The patient must send the VASF screenshot daily to the evaluator, via WhatsApp or email.;Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1). The Piko-1 spirometer device  will be sent to the home of each patient by post and a telematic control of its use will be carried out. The evaluator will ask the patient to indicate their level of FEV1 assessed by Piko-1 device, twice each time. FEV1 obtained values by patients must send to the evaluator, via WhatsApp or email. We will calculate means of each 2 measurements, assessed by patients every day. ;Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT).  The 6MWT will be performed by all patients in their home, under the telematically supervision of a physiotherapist. All patients will receive the same instructions before the walk, and will be encouraged by the physiotherapist who repeated set phrases every minute during the walk. The distance covered during the test will be recorded in meters telematically by patient smartphone. Patients will be allowed to stop and rest during the test but they will be instructed to resume walking as soon as they felt able to do so. Patients will send the results of 6MWT screenshot daily to the evaluator, via WhatsApp or email. ;hirty Seconds Sit-To-Stand Test (30STST). Evaluators will ask patients to place a straight-backed armless chair, with a hard seat , which will be stabilized by placing it against a wall, considering floor to seat height will be between 45 - 50 cm. Seated participants will asked to come forward on the seat until their feet will be flat on the floor, and to fold their upper limbs across the chest, without moving it during all test. Patients will be then instructed to stand up all the way and sit down once without using the upper limbs. Patients will start in the seated position on the chair and, upon command telematically, they will stand up, and then they will return to sitting as many times as they could, in a 30-second time period. The evaluators will control this test telematically by videoconference.;Borg Scale (BS). The Borg scale, of perceived effort, measures the entire range of effort that the individual perceives when exercising. This scale gives criteria to make adjustments to the intensity of exercise, that is, to the workload, and thus forecast and dictate the different intensities of exercise in sports and medical rehabilitation. The BS will be completed by patients at the beginning of each session, and after completing the exercise program, as well as at the end of the tests, every day (6MWT, 30STST). Patients will send the results of BS screenshot daily to the evaluator, via WhatsApp or email. ",

Variables with normal distribution will be described as mean ± standard deviation and variables with non-normal distribution as median and interquartile range. Comparisons of continuous variables between the two groups will be performed using Student's t test for data with normal distribution and Mann-Whitney test for non-normal data. For the comparative analysis of categorical variables, the Chi-Square tests will be used. For comparisons of variables between groups by sessions, the mixed model of analysis of repeated measures over time with adjustment for Tukey will be used. Univariate and multivariate linear regression will be used for association with mechanical ventilation time and 60-day survival.\u003cbr\u003eIn all tests performed, the significance level of 5% will be considered.",

Adult ICU patients with serious/life-threatening COVID-19 receiving standard empiric therapies as per institutional and international protocols such as available antiviral treatments, hydroxychloroquine, mechanical (ARDS-net and prone position) ventilation,  fluid resuscitation, vasoactive substances, antibiotics amongst other usual ICU supportive therapies will be randomised to control or TPE groups.

Randomization will occur in variable block sizes of 4 to 8 patients. The researchers will utilize a web-based randomization service (randomize.net) to allocate patients to their respective strata prior to the intervention or control therapy. Given the nature of the TPE technology, the intervention will be unblinded (open label); hence, no enrollment concealment will be expedited.

It also covers the mass media coverage of the outbreak and the public’s response to this media coverage, which includes a subplot on the stockpiling of essential goods, and the impact thereof on health-care services (e.g., doctors being unable to access protective equipment). After the video, participants answer COVID-19 related questions. Intervention 2: The participants first receive the COVID-19 questions, and then receive the CoVideo. Intervention 3: The participants first receive an attention placebo control (PAC) video, which is animated, has the same duration as the CoVideo, and deals with the impact of daily life choices and health outcomes.

Symptoms are defined as fever (body temperature = 37.8 °C oral/tympanic, or = 38.2 °C rectal) for more than 24 hours associated either with headache, sore throat, dry cough, fatigue, chest pain or choking sensation (with no associated respiratory distress), myalgia, anosmia or ageusia.\u003cbr\u003e4.Patients with the following hematological and biochemical laboratory parameters obtained at enrolment:\u003cbr\u003eHemoglobin \u003e 9.0 g dL-1\u003cbr\u003eCreatinine clearance = 50 mL min-1 by the Cockcroft-Gault formula \u003cbr\u003eTotal serum bilirubin \u003c 2 x ULN\u003cbr\u003eAlkaline phosphatase, AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) \u003c 3 x ULN;\u003cbr\u003e5.Females and males receiving the study treatment and their partners must agree to use a highly effective contraceptive method during the study and for 6 months (180 days) after end of study or early termination. Contraception should be in place at least 2 weeks prior to enrolment. Women must be surgically sterile or if of childbearing potential must use a highly effective contraceptive method. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) will enter the study after confirmed menstrual period and a negative pregnancy test. Highly effective methods of contraception include true abstinence, intrauterine device (IUD) or hormonal contraception aiming at inhibition of ovulation, intrauterine hormone releasing system, bilateral tubal ligation, vasectomized partner. True abstinence is defined when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. In each case of delayed menstrual period (over one month between menstruations) confirmation of absence of pregnancy is required. This recommendation also applies to WOCBP with infrequent or irregular menstrual cycle. Female and male patients must not be planning pregnancy during the trial and for 6 months post completion of their participation in the trial. In addition, male patients should use condom during the trial and for 6 months (180 days) post completion of their participation in the study.
